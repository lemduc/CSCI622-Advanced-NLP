Rachel Pike : The science behind a climate headline
That report was written by 620 scientists from 40 countries .
They wrote almost a thousand pages on the topic .
Over 15,000 scientists go to San Francisco every year for that .
We blow it up and look at the pieces .
This is the EUPHORE Smog Chamber in Spain .
But still , we look at the pieces .
And it takes weeks to perform our integrations .
We also fly all over the world looking for this thing .
And this is the tower from below .
So maybe you took a similar aircraft to get here today .
We hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering .
We have to get special flight clearance .
So you can imagine the scale of the effort .
Thank you very much .
Christopher deCharms : A look inside the brain in real time
You can mimic what you can see .
You can program the hundreds of muscles in your arm .
I &apos;m going to tell you about that technology .
People envision this as being very difficult .
It was terribly dangerous .
You could be attacked by white blood cells in the arteries .
But now , we have a real technology to do this .
We &apos;re going to fly into my colleague Peter &apos;s brain .
We &apos;re going to do it non-invasively using MRI .
He can look at these 65,000 points of activation per second .
So put your arms back up and flex your bicep .
When they control their brain , they can control their pain .
When you do , what do you want to control ?
But I want to leave with you the big question .
Where will we take it ?
Beeban Kidron : The shared wonder of film
We are inveterate storytellers .
Cinema is arguably the 20th century &apos;s most influential art form .
As a filmmaker , it worried me .
The films were curated and contextualized .
The outcome , immediate .
It was an education of the most profound and transformative kind .
It &apos;s a remarkable comment on slums , poverty and aspiration .
Frank Capra &apos;s classic values independence and propriety .
After all , Jimmy Stewart filibustered for two entire reels .
As they watch more films their lives got palpably richer .
&quot; Pickpocket &quot; started a debate about criminality disenfranchisement .
&quot; To Sir , with Love &quot; ignited its teen audience .
And those without friends started making them .
The films provided communality across all manner of divide .
And the stories they held provided a shared experience .
Who was right , who wrong ?
What would they do under the same conditions ?
Was the tale told well ?
Was there a hidden message ?
How has the world changed ? How could it be different ?
And they themselves had not known they cared .
I have an aunt who is a wonderful storyteller .
I was past 40 when my father died .
He never mentioned that journey .
After two years in hiding , my grandfather appeared in London .
He was never right again .
And his story was hushed as he assimilated .
But within the reels lie purpose and meaning .
Consider &quot; Citizen Kane &quot; as valuable as Jane Austen .
They are neither feral nor myopically self-absorbed .
Thank you .
Ellen Jorgensen : Biohacking -- you can do it , too
It &apos;s a great time to be a molecular biologist .
Reading and writing DNA code is getting easier and cheaper .
Biotech is probably the most powerful and the fastest-growing technology sector .
So who gets to do it ?
But what about that guy ?
In 2009 , I first heard about DIYbio .
I thought so .
The press started calling us .
Let me take you on a little tour .
Biohackers work alone .
We reverse engineer lab equipment .
We genetically engineer bacteria .
We like to build things .
Then we like to take things apart .
We make things grow .
We make things glow .
And we make cells dance .
I &apos;m not going to minimize those concerns .
That &apos;s a lot more than conventional science has done .
Now , we follow state and local regulations .
I &apos;ve actually chosen to take a different kind of risk .
I signed up for something called the Personal Genome Project .
So this stuff is just beginning .
We &apos;re only seeing just the tip of the DNA iceberg .
Let me show you what you could do right now .
I discovered an invasive species in my own backyard .
Looked like a ladybug , right ?
It actually is a Japanese beetle .
You can make some sort of a biofuel cell .
You can do a lot of things .
It &apos;s really cool .
Some people ask me , well , why am I involved ?
I could have a perfectly good career in mainstream science .
It just has to follow safety guidelines .
It &apos;s spaces like these that spawned personal computing .
Why not personal biotech ?
Geert Chatrou : A whistleblower you haven &apos;t heard
Thank you very much .
That was whistling .
I &apos;m trying to do this in English .
So I whistled along with him .
I whistled alone . I whistled in the classroom .
I whistled on &#91; my &#93; bike . I whistled everywhere .
So &quot; Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer &quot; -- you know it ?
But it can also sound like this .
And I just couldn &apos;t .
So , okay , I &apos;m going to America .
I would love to , but why ?
So I immediately called her up , of course .
She didn &apos;t expect me to go there .
And I would have lost my face .
I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s correct English .
But the Dutch people here will understand what I mean .
I lost my face .
And she thought , &quot; He will never go there . &quot;
But actually I did .
That was great fun , of course .
Then I couldn &apos;t participate for a few years .
And actually I earn my money whistling at the moment .
So I quit my day job as a nurse .
Okay , I &apos;m not the only one whistling here .
You say , &quot; Huh , what do you mean ? &quot;
Well actually , you are going to whistle along .
Why ? Can I go away ? &quot;
No , you can &apos;t .
Actually it &apos;s very simple .
It &apos;s about 80 minutes long .
No , no , no . It &apos;s four minutes long .
And I want to first rehearse with you your whistling .
So I whistle the tone .
Sorry . I forgot one thing .
You whistle the same tone as me .
I heard a wide variety of tones .
This is very promising .
This is very promising .
I &apos;ll ask the technicians to start the music .
Oh , hah .
I &apos;m so sorry , technicians .
I &apos;m so used to that .
I start it myself .
Okay , here it is .
Okay .
It &apos;s easy , isn &apos;t it ?
Now comes the solo . I propose I do that myself .
Geert Chatrou : Thank you . Thank you .
Francesca Fedeli : Ciao .
So he &apos;s Mario . He &apos;s our son .
But in the end everything seemed to be under control .
So he got the right weight at birth .
He got the right Apgar index .
So we were pretty reassured by this .
As you might know , a stroke is a brain injury .
So life had to change .
We needed to change our schedule .
As you may imagine , unfortunately , we were not ready .
And that has been really a tough time .
And what went wrong ?
Will he be able to be normal ?
Honestly , we went down .
So immediately , as Francesca said , we changed our life .
Basically , we spent months doing this with Mario .
He was looking at us .
We were his mirror .
And that day really changed our perspective .
And we started from our passions .
This short video is from last week .
This is why we are here .
Mario !
And we thank you so much , all of you .
Thank you . Thank you . Bye .
Thank you .
Mark Shaw : One very dry demo
Not anymore .
Porous , nonporous .
So what &apos;s superhydrophobic ?
A windshield coating is going to give you about 110 degrees .
Did you guess the one that was dry ?
And we &apos;re talking really small here .
So very small , but very useful .
And it &apos;s not just water that this works with .
You can see the difference .
It &apos;s that afraid of the water .
So what &apos;s going on here ? What &apos;s happening ?
So what are the applications ?
We &apos;ve certainly seen that today .
It could be anti-corrosion .
No water , no corrosion .
It could be anti-bacterial .
Without water , the bacteria won &apos;t survive .
It &apos;s happening !
Dan Ariely : Our buggy moral code
I was burned very badly .
And the nurses told me two things .
This is not just in Hebrew , by the way .
So that &apos;s what I did .
I kept on doing this for a while .
And here &apos;s how it went .
Other people I would tempt to cheat .
I would pass their sheet of paper .
People now solved seven questions on average .
You say , what &apos;s the probability of being caught ?
How much do I stand to gain from cheating ?
And how much punishment would I get if I get caught ?
So , we try to test this .
What about the probability of being caught ?
Some people shredded the whole sheet of paper .
We call this like a personal fudge factor .
Now , how would you test a personal fudge factor ?
Then they shredded it . No cheating whatsoever .
So , all this was about decreasing the fudge factor .
What about increasing the fudge factor ?
No bill ever disappeared .
Think about the following intuition .
These things feel very differently .
Our subjects doubled their cheating .
People see each other behaving .
What does this cause us ?
So , we did another experiment .
The same thing happens .
When we give people the opportunity to cheat , they cheat .
They cheat just by a little bit , all the same .
But in this experiment we also hired an acting student .
That &apos;s it . The task is finished . &quot;
Nobody knew it was an actor .
And they clearly cheated in a very , very serious way .
What would happen to the other people in the group ?
Will they cheat more , or will they cheat less ?
Here is what happens .
Here is the thing .
We ran this at Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh .
It was about the norms for cheating .
So , what have we learned from this about cheating ?
We &apos;ve learned that a lot of people can cheat .
They cheat just by a little bit .
When we remind people about their morality , they cheat less .
Would they not be able to see it this way ?
Of course they would .
The question is , are we going to test those intuitions ?
And I learned two interesting things .
I felt my intuition was correct . &quot;
Thank you very much .
Jane McGonigal : Massively multi-player … thumb-wrestling ?
So thank you , Monochrom .
Sunni , let &apos;s just remind them .
So the first thing we need is more thumbs .
So Eric , come on over .
That is not how you win .
Ah , who did that ? Eric you did that .
We can really go for it .
So you can see up here .
So I think we should kind of get some more involved .
Perfect .
So this is the kind of simple level , right ?
But there are advanced configurations .
This is called the Death Star Configuration .
Any Star Wars fans ?
And this one &apos;s called the Möbius Strip .
Any science geeks , you get that one .
This is the hardest level . This is the extreme .
Thirty seconds . Into the network . Make the node .
Stand up ! It &apos;s easier if you stand up .
Everybody , up up up up up !
Stand up , my friends .
All right .
Don &apos;t start wrestling yet .
Okay . We need to do a last-minute thumb check .
Grab that thumb !
Reach behind you . There you go .
Any other thumbs ?
Try to keep track . Grab , grab , grab it .
Okay ? One , two , three , go !
Well done . Thank you . Thank you very much .
All right .
So curiosity .
I said &quot; massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling . &quot;
So I provoked a little curiosity .
I &apos;m reaching around and I &apos;m reaching up .
So you used creativity . That was great .
You heard that sound go up in the room .
We have relief . You got to stand up .
We had some contentment .
And it &apos;s truly awesome and wondrous .
And the last emotion of pride .
How many people are like me . Just admit it .
You lost both your thumbs .
It just didn &apos;t work out for you .
That &apos;s okay , because you learned a new skill today .
So congratulations .
How many of you won just won thumb ?
All right . I have very good news for you .
So congratulations , grandmasters .
Win one thumb once , you will become a grandmaster .
Did anybody win both their thumbs ?
Yes . Awesome . Okay .
Get ready to update your Twitter or Facebook status .
Pick off the one that looks easiest .
They &apos;re not paying attention . They look kind of weak .
Focus on that one and do something crazy with this arm .
As soon as you win , suddenly stop .
Everybody is thrown off . You go in for the kill .
Thank you for letting me teach you my favorite game .
Wooo !
Thank you .
David Byrne : How architecture helped music evolve
It was , remarkably , a pretty good sounding room .
This is a song that was recorded there .
This is not Talking Heads , in the picture anyway .
The lyrics of the songs could be pretty much understood .
The sound system was kind of decent .
And there wasn &apos;t a lot of reverberation in the room .
So the rhythms could be pretty intact too , pretty concise .
Other places around the country had similar rooms .
This is Tootsie &apos;s Orchid Lounge in Nashville .
The clientele behavior was very much the same too .
And it &apos;s been very exciting .
Is that a kind of model for creativity ?
Okay , Africa .
The music works perfectly in that setting .
It &apos;s no accident .
It &apos;s perfect for that particular context .
In a gothic cathedral , this kind of music is perfect .
It actually improves it .
This is a little bit later .
This is the kind of rooms that Mozart wrote in .
I think we &apos;re in like 1770 , somewhere around there .
It fits the room perfectly .
This is La Scala .
And well , that was an opera experience .
This is the opera house that Wagner built for himself .
And the size of the room is not that big .
It &apos;s smaller than this .
But Wagner made an innovation .
He wanted a bigger band .
Okay .
This is Carnegie Hall .
Obviously , this kind of thing became popular .
The halls got bigger . Carnegie Hall &apos;s fair-sized .
It &apos;s larger than some of the other symphony halls .
And they &apos;re a lot more reverberant than La Scala .
They had to be very quiet .
This is Mahler .
It looks like Bob Dylan , but it &apos;s Mahler .
That was Bob &apos;s last record , yeah .
Popular music , coming along at the same time .
This is a jazz band .
Again , it &apos;s noisy . They &apos;re playing for dancers .
And they &apos;d say , &quot; Play that part again . &quot;
So the bands started to improvise new melodies .
And a new form of music was born .
These are played mainly in small rooms .
People are dancing , shouting and drinking .
&#91; Live music &#93; doesn &apos;t really change that much .
And this was one way that the music got there .
Other singers after him went even further .
This is Chet Baker .
It would have been impossible without recorded music as well .
And he &apos;s singing right into your ear .
He &apos;s whispering into your ears .
The effect is just electric .
So at this point , music diverged .
There &apos;s live music , and there &apos;s recorded music .
And they no longer have to be exactly the same .
So the early hip-hop guys would loop certain sections .
And another new form of music was born .
Musicians who ended up there did the best they could .
The tempos are medium . It sounds big .
It &apos;s more a social situation than a musical situation .
So there &apos;s more new venues .
One of the new ones is the automobile .
I grew up with a radio in a car .
But now that &apos;s evolved into something else .
The car is a whole venue .
Automobile music , you can share with your friends .
Presumably , this is just for Christian music .
So that doesn &apos;t really work .
And does it happen anywhere else ?
So birds do it too .
Yeah . I think it &apos;s evolutionary .
It &apos;s adaptive .
We already know where that passion is going .
But this conflict of views is kind of interesting .
And they &apos;ll vote for that .
We adapt .
We sing .
Thank you very much .
Kevin Breel : Confessions of a depressed comic
That &apos;s the life everyone sees .
But that &apos;s sadness . That &apos;s a natural thing .
That &apos;s a natural human emotion .
It &apos;s a massive problem .
But we don &apos;t see it on social media , right ?
That &apos;s their problem . &quot;
I came this close to doing it .
See , some people might fear girls not liking them back .
Some people might fear sharks . Some people might fear death .
You don &apos;t beat it once and it &apos;s gone forever .
That &apos;s what keeps you from getting help .
That &apos;s what makes you hold it in and hide it .
That &apos;s the stigma .
And I don &apos;t know what the solution is .
We need to speak up and shatter the silence .
You &apos;re wrong , because it &apos;s the opposite .
We &apos;re people , and we have problems .
We &apos;re not perfect , and that &apos;s okay .
And I believe that we can .
I believe that we can . Thank you guys so much .
This is a dream come true . Thank you .
Thank you .
Ronny Edry : Israel and Iran : A love story ?
And I was like , &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
We don &apos;t know people from Iran .
And now people from Iran are talking to me .
So I &apos;m like , whoa .
And everybody &apos;s crying now .
Because it &apos;s working , put me in a poster now .
Tell the Iranians we from Israel love you too . &quot;
It was a huge amount of pictures .
If it &apos;s an image , they may read it .
So here are a few of them .
They have graphic designers . What ?
Crazy , crazy .
So . And now it &apos;s communication .
And it became really big at some point .
And then it became news .
Who is everybody ? &quot; &quot; Everybody . &quot;
They said , &quot; Syria ? &quot; &quot; Syria . &quot;
&quot; Lebanon ? &quot; &quot; Lebanon . &quot;
It &apos;s everybody . &quot; The Chinese .
And we were just at the beginning of the story .
Something crazy also happened .
I give you Iran-Loves-Israel . &quot;
You have Palestine-Loves-Israel .
You have Lebanon that just -- a few days ago .
We really changed how people see the Middle East .
Because you &apos;re not in the Middle East .
And for a few days you got those images .
They see images of us , and they see bad images .
Look at this one . This is the Iran-Loves-Israel page .
This is not the Israel-Loves-Iran . This is not my page .
This is the enemy .
What ?
And it &apos;s going both ways .
And we &apos;re understanding . And you show compassion .
And you become friends .
You can go and travel and meet people .
And I was in Munich a few weeks ago .
And that was the end of it .
Remember that image from the beginning ?
And it goes the other way around .
Just read where those guys are from .
Just people sending their pictures .
Crazy , yes ?
I know how it can look really bad .
And really , we can be our own ambassadors .
We can just send a message and hope for the best .
And maybe that image will help us change something .
Just raise that . Exactly .
Oh my God .
Don &apos;t cry .
Thank you guys .
Charles Moore : Seas of plastic
Let &apos;s talk trash .
Only we humans make waste that nature can &apos;t digest .
Plastics are also hard to recycle .
It &apos;s diddly-point-squat .
That &apos;s the percentage we recycle .
Now , melting point has a lot to do with this .
Notice that the bottles here have caps on them .
but , mostly bottle caps .
We cleaned up the swaths of beach shown .
I offered five cents each for bottle caps .
I got plenty of takers .
Here are the 1,100 bottle caps they collected .
I thought I would spend 20 bucks .
That day I ended up spending nearly 60 .
And this .
Now , you can buy certified organic produce .
This is the legacy we are leaving to future generations .
The throwaway society cannot be contained -- it has gone global .
We simply cannot store and maintain or recycle all our stuff .
We have to throw it away .
All the king &apos;s horses and all the king &apos;s men ...
Anchor : He offers no hope of cleaning it up .
Charles Moore : Thank you .
Carolyn Steel : How food shapes our cities
How do you feed a city ?
It &apos;s one of the great questions of our time .
Yet it &apos;s one that &apos;s rarely asked .
And increasingly these landscapes are not just feeding us either .
And it &apos;s an escalating problem too .
So meat and urbanism are rising hand in hand .
And that &apos;s going to pose an enormous problem .
Six billion hungry carnivores to feed , by 2050 .
We &apos;re very hungry for fossil fuels too .
Half the food produced in the USA is currently thrown away .
None of it makes very much sense .
So how did we get here ?
Because , as you can see , it was crescent shaped .
And it was also fertile .
And in fact , that &apos;s true of every ancient city .
But of course not all of them were that small .
So how did a city like this feed itself ?
The answer is what I call &quot; ancient food miles . &quot;
And the food obviously went off very quickly .
So Rome shaped its hinterland through its appetite .
So the grain markets were to the south of the city .
And the same of course was true for fish .
Which is extraordinary , really , when you think about it .
But also you have to imagine it full of food .
And then 10 years later everything changed .
This is an image of the Great Western in 1840 .
And they &apos;re coming into the city by rail .
And this changes everything .
All of a sudden they are effectively emancipated from geography .
Now it &apos;s anonymous .
We just read the back of a label on a packet .
So instead of trusting it , we fear it .
And instead of valuing it , we throw it away .
So what are we going to do about that ?
It &apos;s not a new question .
500 years ago it &apos;s what Thomas More was asking himself .
This is the frontispiece of his book &quot; Utopia . &quot;
the ordering principle of his vision .
Utopia was actually a word that Thomas Moore used deliberately .
It can either mean a good place , or no place .
I believe we already live in Sitopia .
Well I think it looks a bit like this .
This is where food should be in our society .
By the way , these can be men as well .
We need these people . We &apos;re part of a network .
But networks , markets where food is being grown locally .
It &apos;s common . It &apos;s fresh .
It &apos;s part of the social life of the city .
Cows with a view .
Steaming piles of humus .
This is basically bringing the whole thing together .
And this is a community project I visited recently in Toronto .
It &apos;s a re-conceptualization of the way food shapes our lives .
It &apos;s Ambrogio Lorenzetti &apos;s &quot; Allegory of Good Government . &quot;
It &apos;s about the relationship between the city and the countryside .
And I think the message of this is very clear .
What would an allegory of good government look like today ?
Because I think it &apos;s an urgent question .
We know we are what we eat .
Thank you very much .
Eddi Reader : &quot; Kiteflyer &apos;s Hill &quot;
So this is another one dedicated to that guy ...
who I &apos;ve got over .
But this is &quot; Kiteflyer &apos;s Hill . &quot;
Thank you very much .
Christopher C. Deam : The Airstream , restyled
In fact it appeared like they referenced a mountain cabin .
So that became a challenge .
It &apos;s a compound curve interior .
That &apos;s the trailer , pretty much finished .
The trailers themselves are actually hand-built .
They didn &apos;t want to go to a componentized system .
And there it is , that &apos;s the Bambi 16 .
Elliot Krane : The mystery of chronic pain
Please keep your seat .
A very different feeling .
Now what does it have to do with chronic pain ?
Imagine , if you will , these two ideas together .
In fact , imagine something even worse .
It was cadaverically cold to the touch .
How can the nervous system get this so wrong ?
So people imagine the nervous system is just like that .
These glial cells become activated .
And that &apos;s why pain becomes its own disease .
The nervous system has plasticity .
It changes , and it morphs in response to stimuli .
Well , what do we do about that ?
What can we do in a case like Chandler &apos;s ?
But the future is actually even brighter .
Thank you very much .
Bruce Aylward : How we &apos;ll stop polio for good
Actually , it &apos;s a really big idea .
This is a polio vaccine .
This is a great technology .
We can take it completely for granted .
But it wasn &apos;t always that way .
People were terrified of this disease .
And it was because of scenes like this .
In this scene , people are living in an iron lung .
This disease was terrifying .
There was no cure , and there was no vaccine .
Twenty years later , they succeeded and developed the polio vaccine .
It was hailed as a scientific miracle in the late 1950s .
But this wasn &apos;t the case everywhere in the world .
But the reality is that polio still exists today .
This is the picture .
There &apos;s not very much left in the world .
Hundreds of people were paralyzed .
Hundreds of people died -- children as well as adults .
They had come from thousands of miles away .
And in one case , it originated on another continent .
But the message was very clear .
Polio is still a devastating , explosive disease .
It &apos;s just happening in another part of the world .
We &apos;re not trying to control polio .
So what we &apos;re looking for is a permanent solution .
This virus can only survive in people .
It can &apos;t live for a very long time in people .
It doesn &apos;t survive in the environment hardly at all .
So we are trying to wipe out this virus completely .
So those are the kind of stakes that we &apos;re after .
So it was a massive effort .
Even then , kids need many doses of the vaccine .
With polio it &apos;s almost completely different .
Now giving the polio vaccine is simple .
It &apos;s just two drops , like that .
But reaching 500 million people is much , much tougher .
But one of the most extraordinary is Rotary International .
They &apos;re right at the center of the whole thing .
Last year , it was 1,000 .
We should abandon this idea of eradication .
Let &apos;s settle for control -- that &apos;s good enough . &quot;
There &apos;s absolutely no question .
These are children like Umar .
Umar also has polio .
Umar was paralyzed for life .
His right leg was paralyzed in 2004 .
Umar is an exceptional kid in exceptional circumstances .
The reality of polio today is something very different .
Polio strikes the poorest communities in the world .
We think children deserve better .
And we didn &apos;t start with the easy places .
And yet , the impossible is happening .
India &apos;s not unique .
Now we &apos;re in tough times economically .
Finishing polio eradication is the right thing to do .
Here &apos;s a great idea to spread : End polio now .
Help us tell the story .
Thank you .
Where would you say we need to be the smartest ?
It keeps getting reinfected .
They &apos;re going to be the tough ones .
Now what about the money ?
And is it easy to raise that money ?
B It &apos;s interesting .
That &apos;s what it costs to reach 500 million children .
But right now we don &apos;t have enough of that .
And that great buy costs us a little bit more .
So good luck . We &apos;re all in this with you .
Thank you .
Frank Warren : Half a million secrets
Hi , my name is Frank , and I collect secrets .
It all started with a crazy idea in November of 2004 .
I printed up 3,000 self-addressed postcards , just like this .
But soon the idea began spreading virally .
Soon my crazy idea didn &apos;t seem so crazy .
PostSecret.com is the most visited advertisement-free blog in the world .
And this is my postcard collection today .
I never did have someone . &quot;
Secrets can take many forms .
They can be shocking or silly or soulful .
Maybe one of you sent this one in .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; Dear Birthmother , I have great parents .
I &apos;ve found love . I &apos;m happy . &quot;
&quot; Your mic wasn &apos;t off during sound check .
We all heard you pee . &quot;
Right . You know what I &apos;m saying .
He pays me a lot to keep it a secret . &quot;
It &apos;s in my pocket right now . &quot;
He said , &quot; My knees are still shaking . &quot;
But she finally did .
She got to that bottom secret , his proposal to her .
And he emailed me this picture .
&quot; I found your camera at Lollapalooza this summer .
This one &apos;s my favorite .
&quot; That &apos;s me , my husband and son .
The other pictures are of my very ill grandmother .
Thank you for making your site .
These pictures mean more to me than you know .
My son &apos;s birth is on this camera .
He turns four tomorrow . &quot;
Secrets can take many forms .
They can be shocking or silly or soulful .
Voicemail recording : First saved voice message .
Have a real happy birthday , and I love you .
I &apos;ll say bye for now .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Frank , that was beautiful , so touching .
Have you ever sent yourself a postcard ?
Have you ever sent in a secret to PostSecret ?
I have one of my own secrets in every book .
Has anyone in your life been able to tell ?
Sometimes I share that information , yeah .
Tony Porter : A call to men
This is my two at home , Kendall and Jay .
They &apos;re 11 and 12 .
Kendall &apos;s 15 months older than Jay .
Daddy &apos;s got you . That &apos;s all that &apos;s important .
Hold your head up . Look at me .
Explain to me what &apos;s wrong .
Tell me what &apos;s wrong . I can &apos;t understand you .
Why are you crying ? &quot;
Just go on , go on in your room .
Like a man .
And he &apos;s five years old .
What am I doing ? Why would I do this ? &quot;
And I think back .
I think back to my father .
We lived in New York City , as I said .
And the limousine empties out .
I grew up in tenement buildings in the inner city .
And he was hanging out with all us younger guys .
He was a troubled kid .
His mother had died from a heroin overdose .
He was being raised by his grandmother .
His father wasn &apos;t on the set .
His grandmother had two jobs .
He was home alone a lot .
He was cool . He was fine .
He was having sex .
We all looked up to him .
They called me Anthony growing up as a kid .
&quot; Hey Anthony , come on upstairs . &quot;
Johnny call , you go .
So I run right upstairs .
Now I immediately knew what he meant .
Two things : One , I never had sex .
We don &apos;t talk about that as men .
There ain &apos;t no first time .
Women are objects , especially sexual objects .
Anyway , so I couldn &apos;t tell him any of that .
He told me to go in his room .
She &apos;s 16 years old .
She &apos;s nude .
We had a whole choice of inappropriate names for her .
Anyway , Johnny had just gotten through having sex with her .
So he was offering me the opportunity to do the same .
Folks , I &apos;m petrified .
So now there &apos;s a living room full of guys .
It was like the waiting room in the doctor &apos;s office .
But I knew I felt bad about what was happening .
We see that as an equation that equals violence against women .
I need you on board . I need you with me .
He said to me , &quot; I would be free . &quot;
Thank you folks .
Stanley McChrystal : Listen , learn ... then lead
And you put on the T-10 parachute .
Then you take off .
They give 20 minutes -- that &apos;s a time warning .
You sit there , OK .
Then they give you 10 minutes .
And of course , you &apos;re responding with all of these .
Then they give you , &quot; Get ready . &quot;
Then they go , &quot; Outboard personnel , stand up . &quot;
If you &apos;re an outboard personnel , now you stand up .
If you &apos;re an inboard personnel , stand up .
I &apos;m probably going to jump .
So nice air comes flowing in .
The jumpmasters start to check the door .
Jump is a misnomer ; you fall .
But typically you do ; typically it opens .
Boom .
Now you prepare for the inevitable .
You are going to hit the ground .
You can &apos;t delay that much .
It &apos;s this elegant little land , twist and roll .
And that &apos;s not going to hurt .
In 30-some years of jumping , I never did one .
They &apos;d be doing everything that we had taught them .
When we landed on the drop-zone , everything had changed .
But things had changed ; I was a 46-year-old brigadier general .
And I also was raised with personal examples of leadership .
This was my father in Vietnam .
And I still believe real leaders are like that .
And I &apos;m not sure that was real interaction .
And I had an armored organization at that point .
The enemy didn &apos;t break a sweat doing it .
Sort of leadership by humiliation .
But everything we do is in a different context .
I have to have trust in them and vice versa .
And I also have to build their faith .
And that &apos;s a new kind of leadership for me .
We failed .
The mission didn &apos;t work .
Entirely new requirement .
Also , the people had changed .
And yet , we need to have that shared sense .
And it &apos;s a brand new leadership challenge .
Then another thing .
There &apos;s an effect on you and on your leaders .
There &apos;s an impact , it &apos;s cumulative .
You don &apos;t reset , or recharge your battery every time .
And I remembered his son was in our force .
I said , &quot; Where is he now ? &quot;
Think about knowing that over time .
And it &apos;s a new cumulative pressure on leaders .
And you have to watch and take care of each other .
I probably learned the most about relationships .
I learned they are the sinew which hold the force together .
I grew up much of my career in the Ranger regiment .
It &apos;s a promise .
And every Ranger gets that same promise from every other Ranger .
Think about it . It &apos;s extraordinarily powerful .
It &apos;s probably more powerful than marriage vows .
And so the organizational relationship that bonds them is just amazing .
And I learned personal relationships were more important than ever .
That was my journey .
I hope it &apos;s not over .
This isn &apos;t easy stuff .
And it isn &apos;t always fair .
Thank you .
Arunachalam Muruganantham : How I started a sanitary napkin revolution !
I saw . &quot; What is that ? &quot; I asked .
My wife replied , &quot; None of your business . &quot;
I don &apos;t even use that cloth to clean my two-wheeler .
And it &apos;s called affordability .
Why not make a local sanitary pad for my new wife ?
So only problem : the only available victim is my wife .
Close your eyes . &quot;
Because I tried to make it intimate .
Because it &apos;s an arranged marriage , not a love marriage .
Then other victims , they got into my sisters .
They are having a lot of women volunteers around them .
Why I am not getting &#91; any &#93; ?
Then I used , tried to use the medical college girls .
My God , it &apos;s unbelievable .
You need first funds .
Why is this ? I used medical college girls .
That is my invention .
Why are they coming for , finally , for philanthropy ?
Why the need for accumulating money , then doing philanthropy ?
What if one decided to start philanthropy from the day one ?
Play video one .
Why not make myself a low-cost napkin ?
That is my idea .
They are performing puja .
I make a rural woman to compete with multinationals .
I &apos;m sustaining on seventh year .
Already 600 installations . What is my mission ?
That &apos;s why I &apos;m not running after this bloody money .
I &apos;m doing something serious .
Do your job simply , the girl will chase you .
Like that , I never chased Mahalakshmi .
Not in front pocket . I &apos;m a back pocket man .
I am becoming a solution provider . I &apos;m very happy .
I don &apos;t want to make this as a corporate entity .
Now 110 countries are accessing it . Okay ?
Thank you very much . Bye !
Stephen Hawking : Questioning the universe
There is nothing bigger or older than the universe .
How did the universe come into being ?
Are we alone in the universe ?
Is there alien life out there ?
What is the future of the human race ?
Then it was discovered that the universe was expanding .
Distant galaxies were moving away from us .
This meant they must have been closer together in the past .
This was the Big Bang , the beginning of the universe .
But was there anything before the Big Bang ?
If not , what created the universe ?
The universe can spontaneously create itself out of nothing .
We think we have solved the mystery of creation .
But we don &apos;t know how life first appeared .
This suggests that a probability of life appearing is reasonably high .
I am discounting the reports of UFOs .
Why would they appear only to cranks and weirdoes ?
But we are entering an increasingly dangerous period of our history .
Thank you for listening .
Professor Hawking , thank you for that answer .
Thank you very much indeed .
Amanda Bennett : We need a heroic narrative for death
So I went to a party .
I talk to him for hours .
Only months later , I discover who he really was .
He was the China representative for the American Soybean Association .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand . Soybeans ?
You told me you were a Fulbright scholar . &quot;
I said , &quot; You jerk . &quot;
Only jerk wasn &apos;t the word I used .
I said , &quot; You could &apos;ve gotten me fired . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Let &apos;s get married . &quot;
&quot; Travel the world and have lots of kids . &quot;
So we did .
And for years , it seemed like we were succeeding .
The surgeon emerged from the surgery .
And yet , he did not die .
Mysteriously , he lived on .
He coached Little League for our son .
He built a playhouse for our daughter .
I &apos;m looking for a cure .
So we try another treatment , aggressive , nasty .
Then another year goes by .
Two years go by .
More specialists .
We take the kids to Italy .
We take the kids to Australia .
This time , there &apos;s new treatments on the horizon .
They &apos;re exotic . They &apos;re experimental .
They &apos;re going to attack the cancer in new ways .
So he enters a clinical trial , and it works .
There &apos;s another drug out there .
It &apos;s newer . It &apos;s more powerful .
He started it just two weeks ago .
Perhaps there &apos;s still hope ahead .
So what do I say ?
I say , &quot; Keep him alive if you can . &quot;
And Terence died six days later .
So we fought , we struggled , we triumphed .
We fought together , we lived together .
It was also an expensive fight .
We never got the chance to say goodbye .
We never thought it was the end .
We always had hope .
So what do we make of all of this ?
And what did I discover ?
Yet I had that piece of paper .
We both did .
And they were readily available .
I had them right at hand .
Yet we never got to no further hope .
Now , what do the experts call this ?
They say it &apos;s denial .
It &apos;s a strong word , isn &apos;t it ?
The family won &apos;t listen to reason .
They &apos;re in denial .
How can they insist on this treatment at the end ?
It &apos;s so clear , yet they &apos;re in denial . &quot;
It &apos;s not just families either .
You want to help . You want to fix .
You want to do .
I saw it firsthand .
Days before he died .
It &apos;s not a bug .
It &apos;s a feature .
Maybe I wanted to believe it .
So what do we need ?
Maybe we don &apos;t need a new piece of paper .
People did mention hospice , but I wouldn &apos;t listen .
So I &apos;ll give you a couple lines from him .
This is a poem about Mark Antony .
Actually , one of Cleopatra &apos;s guys .
And he &apos;s been a pretty good general .
The people are leaving . They &apos;re playing instruments .
They &apos;re singing .
And suddenly he knows he &apos;s been defeated .
And the poet tells him what to do .
And isn &apos;t that what we &apos;re missing ?
The overwhelming presence of hope isn &apos;t denial .
Hope isn &apos;t a bug .
It &apos;s a feature .
Thank you .
Juliana Machado Ferreira : The fight to end rare-animal trafficking in Brazil
And in these places they are cared for .
But then what ?
All of these were released by us .
On the top , the turtles are just enjoying freedom .
But it &apos;s still a big issue in Brazil .
We believe we have performed responsible releases .
We &apos;ve registered released animals mating in nature and having chicks .
So , these genes are indeed going back to the populations .
I &apos;m devoting my career to that .
Thank you very much .
Shawn Achor : The happy secret to better work
So we were up on top of our bunk beds .
Did you see how you landed ?
No human lands on all fours like that .
Amy , I think this means you &apos;re a unicorn . &quot;
And the latter won out .
... with one broken leg .
and then we tailor the class right towards the average .
But normal is merely average .
Bobo married Amy the unicorn .
Which , even at Yale , is extraordinarily rare .
When I applied to Harvard , I applied on a dare .
Tuesday night it &apos;s school violence and bullying .
Wednesday night is eating disorders .
Thursday night is elicit drug use .
Silence on the phone .
The absence of disease is not health .
You &apos;re 37 percent better at sales .
Which means we can reverse the formula .
Exercise teaches your brain that your behavior matters .
Thank you very much .
Dan Ariely : What makes us feel good about our work ?
Think about something like mountaineering and mountain climbing .
No , they are full of misery .
I &apos;ll never do it again . &quot;
And he came one day back to campus .
He was working in a big bank .
This was in preparation for a merger and acquisition .
He stayed late at night every day .
And the guy was deeply depressed .
We &apos;ll pay you three dollars for it . &quot;
And people said yes , and they built with these Legos .
If they said yes , we gave them another one .
This was what we called the meaningful condition .
People built one Bionicle after another .
There was another condition .
This other condition was inspired by David , my student .
And this other condition we called the Sisyphic condition .
And if they said yes , they built it .
Now what happens when you compare these two conditions ?
People were not curing cancer or building bridges .
People were building Bionicles for a few cents .
So there was not a real opportunity for big meaning .
But even the small meaning made a difference .
Now we had another version of this experiment .
What happened ?
People predicted the right direction but not the right magnitude .
There was one other piece of data we looked at .
And that &apos;s actually what we found in the meaningful condition .
What happened in the Sisyphic condition ?
In that condition the correlation was zero .
We basically eliminated it .
And everybody raised their hand .
And everybody raised their hand .
And they came up with all kinds of ideas .
The next experiment was slightly different .
That was the task .
And people did the first sheet .
And we had three conditions .
What happened in those three conditions ?
At 15 cents per page , they basically stopped these efforts .
And this is basically the result we had before .
But what about the ignored condition ?
It turns out it was almost like the shredder .
Now there &apos;s good news and bad news here .
Ignoring gets you a whole way out there .
So there is a store in the U.S. called IKEA .
I put things in the wrong way .
I can &apos;t say enjoy those pieces .
I can &apos;t say I enjoy the process .
And there &apos;s an old story about cake mixes .
But it turns out they were very unpopular .
People did not want them .
And they thought about all kinds of reasons for that .
Maybe the taste was not good .
No , the taste was great .
It was as if you bought it in the store .
It didn &apos;t really feel like your own .
So what did they do ?
They took the eggs and the milk out of the powder .
Now you had to break the eggs and add them .
Now it was your cake . Now everything was fine .
So how do we look at this question experimentally ?
We asked people to build some origami .
How much do you want to pay for it ? &quot;
And we had two types of people .
Which one of those two is correct ?
They thought everybody else would love it more as well .
In the next version we tried to do the IKEA effect .
We tried to make it more difficult .
So for some people we gave the same task .
For some people we made it harder by hiding the instructions .
For some people we just eliminated that .
So now this was tougher . What happened ?
Why ? Because now the builders loved it even more .
They put all this extra effort into it .
And evaluators ? They loved it even less .
Because in reality it was even uglier than the first version .
Now think about kids .
Your memories and associations and so on .
But imagine this was slightly different .
And you played with them for a few hours .
How much would you pay for them now ?
Most people say not that much .
Those are really tough .
Let me say one last comment .
He gave an example of a pin factory .
Is efficiency still more important than meaning ?
I think the answer is no .
Thank you very much .
Amy Lockwood : Selling condoms in the Congo
The DRC is a dangerous place .
There are many health issues as well .
Damien runs a hotel outside of Kinshasa .
He said there &apos;s just not in demand .
They like the generics .
And as a marketer , I found that curious .
Sex !
Their marketing is slightly different .
It might just save their lives .
Thank you .
Vicki Arroyo : Let &apos;s prepare for our new climate
This is the skyline of my hometown , New Orleans .
Half the city is already below sea level .
The changes in these times won &apos;t affect us all equally .
And how will they cope in a foreign land ?
It &apos;s already fueled conflicts in Chad and Darfur .
Sure , some are looking for opportunities in this new world .
Their March electricity bill was only 48 dollars .
We need better planning and systems for evacuation .
Second , preparing for heat and drought .
It &apos;s giving them access to affordable credit .
So some solutions to heat can provide for win-win-wins .
Third , adapting to rising seas .
That &apos;s where half of Vietnam &apos;s rice is grown .
Infrastructure is going to be affected .
Airports around the world are located on the coast .
Imagine the staggering cost of protecting this vital infrastructure with levees .
But now , a word of caution .
Adaptation &apos;s too important to be left to the experts .
Why ? Well , there are no experts .
But we can simply no longer rely on established norms .
The larger point I &apos;m trying to make is this .
There are no quick fixes .
There are no one-size-fits-all solutions .
We &apos;re all learning by doing .
But the operative word is doing .
Thank you .
Aubrey de Grey : A roadmap to end aging
I &apos;m going to talk about why defeating aging is desirable .
I &apos;m going to do that in two steps .
So I &apos;m going to start with why we should .
Now , I want to ask a question .
That was easy . OK .
OK . So we all think malaria is a bad thing .
And here is that characteristic .
What part of this do people not understand ?
It &apos;s a global trance .
And that &apos;s true .
That &apos;s my answer to the overpopulation question .
So that &apos;s all I &apos;m going to say about that .
I &apos;m now going to talk about feasibility .
A very simple definition .
Those side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology .
So then , what do we do about that ?
But it isn &apos;t .
That &apos;s the wrong answer .
But after that , things were pretty steady and pretty uniform .
And you see it in all sorts of technologies .
This is a very important point for me to get across .
I &apos;m not saying that at all .
And the same for 300 and 400 and so on .
Well , it seems to get the point across .
You won &apos;t be able to withstand them .
And that &apos;s quite a thought .
I have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation .
And this is what it is .
I say that &apos;s nonsense .
15 years from the robust mouse .
The public &apos;s perception will probably be somewhat better than that .
The public tends to underestimate how difficult scientific things are .
So they &apos;ll probably think it &apos;s five years away .
But it is not part of metabolism itself .
And this turns out to be useful .
Because we can re-draw our original diagram this way .
The engineering approach does not intervene in any processes .
It does not intervene in this process or this one .
The point about this slide is actually the bottom .
This list is just for illustration ; it is incomplete .
The list on the right is also incomplete .
And there are only seven of them .
Of course one can make a biological argument .
We &apos;re made of cells and stuff between cells .
What can damage accumulate in ?
It &apos;s got to be long-lived molecules .
We do need to really start trying .
And we &apos;ll just end with a few things .
And you know what happened .
So , you know , this does happen .
There &apos;s a proposal to actually put together an institute .
This is what &apos;s going to take a bit of money .
Not very long . OK .
Thank you .
The genes don &apos;t care but we do ?
AG : That &apos;s right .
AG : If you lose a bit of weight .
Your numbers are a bit out .
AG : There are technical implications certainly .
Lewis Pugh : My mind-shifting Everest swim
The water is completely black .
It &apos;s flipping freezing in that water .
I heard about this lake , Lake Imja .
So it &apos;s right up in the heavens .
That &apos;s not the worst part of it .
And we walked up this pathway , all the way up .
I could barely breathe .
I was gasping for air .
I have never , ever heard such utter bollocks .
I got myself to the side of the lake .
And my team just gave it to me straight .
Take some time to rest and think about things .
Instead of swimming crawl , swim breaststroke .
And remember , never ever swim with aggression .
This is the time to swim with real humility .
And I swam across the lake .
The warning signs are all there .
And then the second lesson , the radical , tactical shift .
So thank you very , very much .
John Hodgman : Design , explained .
Ah yes , a table .
We use these every day .
And on top of it , the juicy salif .
Okay , what is this object ?
It looks terrible . Is it a little hot plate ?
I don &apos;t get it .
Does anyone know ? Chi ?
It &apos;s an ... iPhone. iPhone .
No , I have an iPhone . Of course I do .
Here is my well-loved iPhone .
I do so many things on this little device .
I like to read books on it .
And yet I forget about it all the time .
Unlike the Theme Building , this is not alien technology .
And you didn &apos;t even notice it happened .
So there you go . My name is John Hodgman .
I just explained design .
Thank you very much .
Lakshmi Pratury : The lost art of letter-writing
So I thought , &quot; I will talk about death . &quot;
Seemed to be the passion today .
Actually , it &apos;s not about death .
That &apos;s what I want to talk about .
Handwriting is a disappearing art .
But too late .
So what do I plan to leave for my son ?
I plan to publish my own notebook .
I took it out for the first time to come here .
Thank you .
Sergey Brin : Why Google Glass ?
Okay , it &apos;s great to be back at TED .
Okay , Glass , record a video .
This is it . We &apos;re on in two minutes .
Okay Glass , hang out with The Flying Club .
Google &quot; photos of tiger heads . &quot; Hmm .
You ready ? You ready ?
Right there . Okay , Glass , take a picture .
Go !
Man 6 : Holy &#91; beep &#93; ! That is awesome .
Whoa ! Look at that snake !
Woman 3 : Okay , Glass , record a video !
Man 7 : After this bridge , first exit .
Man 8 : Okay , A12 , right there !
Man 9 : Google , say &quot; delicious &quot; in Thai .
Woman 4 : Google &quot; jellyfish . &quot;
Man 10 : It &apos;s beautiful .
He needs help getting 10 million dollars .
Should it be by just walking around looking down ?
You &apos;re just kind of moving around .
And also you want something that frees your eyes .
This project has lasted now , been just over two years .
We &apos;ve learned an amazing amount .
It &apos;s been really important to make it comfortable .
So our first prototypes we built were huge .
It was like cell phones strapped to your head .
It was very heavy , pretty uncomfortable .
But we &apos;ve come a long way .
And the other really unexpected surprise was the camera .
Like if I smoked , I &apos;d probably just smoke instead .
Thank you all very much .
Brené Brown : Listening to shame
And she said , &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
I had a slide that said Breakdown .
And she said , &quot; I saw your Talk live-streamed .
It was not really you .
It was a little different than what you usually do .
But it was great . &quot;
And I said , &quot; This can &apos;t happen .
YouTube , they &apos;re putting this thing on YouTube .
And I said , &quot; Let me ask you something . &quot;
And she said , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
And she said , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
And she goes , &quot; Uh ... no . &quot;
That ... me neither . &quot;
Your sisters would be perfect for this . &quot;
I had no contingency plan for four million .
And my life did end when that happened .
But I want to talk about what I &apos;ve learned .
The first is vulnerability is not weakness .
And that myth is profoundly dangerous .
How many of you think of vulnerability and weakness synonymously ?
The majority of people .
Vulnerability is not weakness .
I define vulnerability as emotional risk , exposure , uncertainty .
It fuels our daily lives .
We &apos;d like you to come in and speak .
What would you like for me to talk about ?
There &apos;s three big answers .
To create is to make something that has never existed before .
There &apos;s nothing more vulnerable than that .
Adaptability to change is all about vulnerability .
And I &apos;m going to be really honest with you .
I &apos;ll give you an example .
I &apos;m a fifth generation Texan .
Our family motto is &quot; Lock and load . &quot;
I am not a natural vulnerability researcher .
And then I hear , &quot; Vulnerability TED ! &quot;
I turn around , I go , &quot; Hi . &quot;
&quot; Look away . &quot;
And I see you .
I learned about these things from studying shame .
And so I want to walk you in to shame .
Jungian analysts call shame the swampland of the soul .
And we &apos;re going to walk in .
Here &apos;s why .
Yes ? We heard that .
Yes ?
And all-powerful folks don &apos;t need checklists .
Myshkin Ingawale , I hope I did right by you .
I saw the TED Fellows my first day here .
And he said , &quot; I saw this need .
So you know what I did ? I made it . &quot;
And he said , &quot; And it didn &apos;t work .
You know what the big secret about TED is ?
I can &apos;t wait to tell people this .
I guess I &apos;m doing it right now .
This is like the failure conference .
No , it is .
You know why this place is amazing ?
Because very few people here are afraid to fail .
I &apos;ve failed miserably , many times .
I don &apos;t think the world understands that because of shame .
You &apos;re not good enough .
You never finished that MBA . Your wife left you .
I know those things that happened to you growing up .
Shame is that thing .
Us .
The thing to understand about shame is it &apos;s not guilt .
Shame is &quot; I am bad . &quot;
Guilt is &quot; I did something bad . &quot;
How many of you would be willing to say that ?
Guilt : I &apos;m sorry . I made a mistake .
Shame : I &apos;m sorry . I am a mistake .
There &apos;s a huge difference between shame and guilt .
And here &apos;s what you need to know .
And here &apos;s what you even need to know more .
Guilt , inversely correlated with those things .
It &apos;s uncomfortable , but it &apos;s adaptive .
Everyone sitting in here knows the warm wash of shame .
And it &apos;s a straight-jacket .
Shame is one , do not be perceived as what ?
Weak .
And I said , &quot; I don &apos;t study men . &quot;
And he said , &quot; That &apos;s convenient . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Why ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
So I started interviewing men and asking questions .
Shame is an epidemic in our culture .
Very quickly , some research by Mahalik at Boston College .
And so I &apos;ll leave you with this thought .
And that is seductive .
But the truth is that never happens .
We want you to go in .
We want to be with you and across from you .
So thank you all very much . I really appreciate it .
Eric Whitacre : Virtual Choir Live
I was in the third year of my seven-year undergraduate degree .
I took a couple victory laps in there .
Now fast forward to just three years ago .
Could we do this all in real time ?
Could we have people singing together in real time ?
Now , we &apos;ll perform &quot; Cloudburst &quot; for you .
We deal in milliseconds .
Thank you .
Laura Trice : Remember to say thank you
And I asked myself , why ?
I felt shy , I felt embarrassed .
So , I decided to investigate .
I know a woman who &apos;s good at this .
So , the question is , why was I blocking it ?
Why were other people blocking it ?
I &apos;m telling you where I &apos;m insecure .
I &apos;m telling you where I need your help .
Because what can you do with that data ?
You could neglect me .
You could abuse it .
Or you could actually meet my need .
So , I &apos;m going to challenge all of you .
Go home to your husband -- what does he need ?
And it &apos;s simple .
And why should we care about this ?
We talk about world peace .
So , let &apos;s make it right in our own backyard .
Thank you .
Carter Emmart : A 3D atlas of the universe
This is the WMAP microwave background that we see .
But this our containment of the visible universe .
I know Dr. Carolyn Porco is the camera P.I.
for the Cassini mission .
This software can also be networked between domes .
And we can network between domes and classrooms .
So you &apos;re seeing the edge of the Earth .
This is Nepal .
This is Nepal and Tibet .
We carry that in us .
Thank you .
Esther Perel : The secret to desire in a long-term relationship
That &apos;s the million-dollar question , right ?
And why is the forbidden so erotic ?
What is it about transgression that makes desire so potent ?
And when you love , how does it feel ?
And when you desire , how is it different ?
So what sustains desire , and why is it so difficult ?
Give me comfort , give me edge .
Give me novelty , give me familiarity .
Give me predictability , give me surprise .
So why does good sex so often fade ?
What is the relationship between love and desire ?
How do they relate , and how do they conflict ?
Because therein lies the mystery of eroticism .
We want to neutralize the tensions . We want closeness .
Forgone conclusion does not keep our interest .
In desire , we want a bridge to cross .
Desire needs space .
But then I took a question with me .
Not attracted sexually , per se , but most drawn .
Radiant , as in self-sustaining .
Nobody needs anybody .
There is no caretaking in desire .
Caretaking is mightily loving . It &apos;s a powerful anti-aphrodisiac .
For good reasons , right ?
But basically it &apos;s when there is novelty .
Novelty is , what parts of you do you bring out ?
What parts of you are just being seen ?
So where do you go in sex ?
What parts of you do you connect to ?
What do you seek to express there ?
Is it a place for transcendence and spiritual union ?
Is it a place where you can express your infantile wishes ?
What comes out there ? It &apos;s a language .
It isn &apos;t just a behavior .
You know , animals have sex .
But the central agent is really that piece called the imagination .
They knew how to keep themselves alive .
And so I began to ask a different question .
And then I began to ask the reverse question .
You know , the erotic mind is not very politically correct .
My partner hasn &apos;t taken care of me in so long .
I will lose my freedom in order not to lose connection .
Translate this into adult language .
&quot; Are you going to be there ?
Are you going to be angry with me ? &quot;
The third child doesn &apos;t really come back .
One , they have a lot of sexual privacy .
Foreplay pretty much starts at the end of the previous orgasm .
Responsibility and desire just butt heads .
They don &apos;t really do well together .
Erotic couples also understand that passion waxes and wanes .
But what they know is they know how to resurrect it .
Committed sex is premeditated sex .
It &apos;s willful . It &apos;s intentional .
It &apos;s focus and presence .
Merry Valentine &apos;s .
Nalini Nadkarni : Life science in prison
Trees epitomize stasis .
I simply tied the end of a paintbrush onto a twig .
You might have a guess .
And our prison system itself is stuck .
The United States has over 2.3 million incarcerated men and women .
That number is rising .
That , I think , is movement .
That , I think , is movement .
That , I think , is movement .
Thank you very much .
Sleepy Man Banjo Boys : Bluegrass virtuosity from ... New Jersey ?
Robbie Mizzone : Thank you .
Tommy Mizzone : Thank you very much .
TM : Thank you very much .
On guitar is my 15-year-old brother Tommy .
On banjo is 10-year-old Jonny .
He &apos;s also our brother .
So you can probably piece the rest together .
It might have been that it weighs about a million pounds .
TM : Thank you very much .
RM : Thank you .
Michael Hansmeyer : Building unimaginable shapes
If we could free ourselves from our education ?
What would these unseen forms look like ?
Would they surprise us ? Would they intrigue us ?
Would they delight us ?
I propose we look to nature .
Nature has been called the greatest architect of forms .
We can abstract them and to create something that is new .
We &apos;re free to choose where we make the fold .
And by doing so , we can differentiate the surfaces .
And in doing so , we can suddenly fold anything .
A simple volume , the cube .
And we can play with this .
We can begin to sculpt the form .
We can make folds that we otherwise could not make .
Surfaces can become porous .
They can stretch . They can tear .
But in each case , I didn &apos;t design the form .
I designed the process that generated the form .
White surfaces have long edges , black ones have short ones .
So let &apos;s bring this process to architecture .
How ? And at what scale ?
I chose to design a column .
Columns are architectural archetypes .
I started using four cylinders .
And these columns , they have information at very many scales .
We can begin to zoom into them .
The closer one gets , the more new features one discovers .
Some formations are almost at the threshold of human visibility .
These forms are undrawable .
In this case , the process is deterministic .
So this leads to a new role for the architect .
But enough of the theory .
There &apos;s been a lot of talk now about 3D printing .
But it was very labor intensive .
But it is increasingly possible .
These are images from the Gwangju Biennale .
Each column is effectively a hybrid of two columns .
So where does this leave us ?
In short , we have no constraints .
Thank you .
David Hoffman : Sputnik mania
The rocket was huge .
On October 4 , 1957 , they launched their rocket .
Now we have the good fortune to open up space .
For days after the launch , Sputnik was a wonderful curiosity .
All hell broke loose .
It provoked the missile gap .
It exploded an arms race .
It began the space race .
And the reactions to Sputnik went far beyond weapons increases .
But Sputnik provoked wonderful changes as well .
&quot; Sputnik &quot; will soon be released .
And I &apos;d like to thank you all .
Thank you , Chris .
Harish Manwani : Profit &apos;s not always the point
Of not just creating economic value but creating social value .
And that model is all about doing well and doing good .
But the question is easier said than done .
But how do we actually get that done ?
There are things that you stand for .
I joined Unilever in 1976 as a management trainee in India .
You &apos;re here to change lives .
You know , I thought it was rather facetious .
We are a company that sells soap and soup .
What are we doing about changing lives ?
We run the largest hand-washing program in the world .
And brands indeed can be at the forefront of social change .
Small actions can make a big difference .
We have 60,000 such women now in India .
Small actions , big difference .
So just think about it .
There are small actions that can make a big difference .
And I can go on and on .
Thank you very much .
Susan Cain : The power of introverts
Because in my family , reading was the primary group activity .
Camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol .
Rowdie , rowdie , let &apos;s get rowdie . &quot;
Yeah .
I did my best .
And I felt kind of guilty about this .
Now , I tell you this story about summer camp .
It &apos;s different from being shy .
Shyness is about fear of social judgment .
But now here &apos;s where the bias comes in .
And kids are working in countless group assignments .
Okay , same thing is true in our workplaces .
I &apos;ll give you some examples .
So no wilderness , no revelations .
So ...
And do you really want to leave it up to chance ?
One answer lies deep in our cultural history .
And they feature as their role models really great salesmen .
So that &apos;s the world we &apos;re living in today .
That &apos;s our cultural inheritance .
Guess what ?
Books .
I have a suitcase full of books .
Here &apos;s Margaret Atwood , &quot; Cat &apos;s Eye . &quot;
Here &apos;s a novel by Milan Kundera .
But these are not exactly my books .
And people would come from all over to hear him speak .
But here &apos;s the thing about my grandfather .
So I prepared for moments like these as best I could .
And I call this my &quot; year of speaking dangerously . &quot;
And that actually helped a lot .
I mean , we are .
Number one : Stop the madness for constant group work .
Just stop it .
Thank you .
That is great .
It &apos;s great for introverts and it &apos;s great for extroverts .
School , same thing .
This is especially important for extroverted children too .
Okay , number two : Go to the wilderness .
Be like Buddha , have your own revelations .
So extroverts , maybe your suitcases are also full of books .
Or maybe they &apos;re full of champagne glasses or skydiving equipment .
And that &apos;s okay .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you .
Yves Behar : Designing objects that tell stories
And then there was another influence .
Those are pretty good escapes from the drab weather in Switzerland .
And I realized then I had to go to design school .
I mean , look at those graphics there .
&quot; You know , do people really use it ?
And I didn &apos;t want to be a colorist .
It wasn &apos;t what I wanted to do .
I didn &apos;t want to be a stylist in this way .
And what I wanted to work on is important stuff .
And then finally , the leaf lamp for Herman Miller .
So , the light bulb actually does that .
But designers are really the glue that brings these things together .
And this is what we &apos;re pursuing here .
But how we work on Jawbone is really unique .
I want to point at something here , on the left .
It &apos;s really about designing from the inside out .
And it &apos;s what I call being design driven .
And then , of course , design is never done .
And here &apos;s another project , another partnership-type approach .
And this allows the bottle to turn into a game .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s another project , which I think really emulates that .
This picture is incredible .
I mean , to me , it just means so much .
But the third pillar that he talked about was design .
I didn &apos;t really want to , from the previous adventure .
They fought the suppliers , they fought the manufacturers .
And I think this is something really important .
And we went away from obviously the beige .
I mean it &apos;s colorful , it &apos;s fun .
Like paper , paper and cardboard .
These are the dispensers . There &apos;s this friendly shape .
And we also designed the condoms themselves .
Of course , clubs and discos , too .
And here &apos;s the public service announcement for this project .
Get some .
So , thank you .
Paul Root Wolpe : It &apos;s time to question bio-engineering
We altered our ecological niche by creating civilization .
Now we actually have been doing it for a long time .
Dogs are the result of selectively breeding traits that we like .
We don &apos;t have to do it that way anymore .
This is a beefalo .
A beefalo is a buffalo-cattle hybrid .
This is a geep , a goat-sheep hybrid .
I think they said it tasted like chicken .
This is a cama .
And they are now using these in certain cultures .
Then there &apos;s the liger .
It &apos;s bigger than a tiger .
And then finally , everybody &apos;s favorite , the zorse .
None of this is Photoshopped . These are real creatures .
But something much , much more powerful is happening now .
We all know that some deep-sea creatures glow .
These are normal cells .
So they did it with mouse pups , kittens .
They did it with pigs .
They did it with puppies .
And , in fact , they did it with monkeys .
Be easier to find us at night .
These are zebra fish . They &apos;re normally black and silver .
Other states have banned them .
Nobody knows what to do with these kinds of creatures .
These are all the first cloned animals of their type .
This is Prometea , the first cloned horse .
The guar is an endangered Southeast Asian ungulate .
We have two kinds of DNA in our bodies .
That DNA is passed down through our mothers .
These are really hybrids , not pure animals .
This lovely creature is an Asian cockroach .
They &apos;ve created a kind of insect bot , or bugbot .
It gets worse than that -- or perhaps better than that .
These goliath beetles are wired in their wings .
They can &apos;t actually make them land .
But it &apos;s the closest they can get to a landing .
It &apos;s not just insects .
The scientists can make this creature go left , right .
They &apos;ve now created an organic robot .
We &apos;ve taken away the autonomy of this animal . &quot;
I &apos;ll get back to that in a minute .
There &apos;s also been work done with monkeys .
This is Miguel Nicolelis of Duke .
This is Thomas DeMarse at the University of Florida .
They self-aggregated into a network , became an integrated chip .
This is a brain from a lamprey eel .
It &apos;s photophilic .
So now we have a complete living lamprey eel brain .
Genetic engineering coupled with polymer physiotechnology coupled with xenotransplantation .
This is where we are in this process .
This is what Frankenstein &apos;s lab looks like .
And so , we need to ask ourselves some questions .
Is everything okay ?
Is it okay to manipulate and create whatever creatures we want ?
Do we have free reign to design animals ?
It &apos;s already happening . It &apos;s not science fiction .
We are now taking control of our own evolution .
Thanks .
Péter Fankhauser : Meet Rezero , the dancing ballbot
Let me introduce to you Rezero .
Our robot belongs to a family of robots called Ballbots .
This means that the robot is inherently unstable .
Now we &apos;ll explain that in a second .
Let me first explain how Rezero actually keeps his balance .
Let &apos;s play a little .
In this mode , he &apos;s trying to maintain his position .
I can also make him spin .
He &apos;s now keeping a constant distance to Thomas .
We call this the orbiting mode .
All right , thank you , Thomas .
Now , what &apos;s the use of this technology ?
Rezero could be used in exhibitions or parks .
And these are more practical applications .
But there &apos;s also a certain beauty within this technology .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Do you know which group you &apos;re in ?
If you don &apos;t , you &apos;re not alone .
Because the breast has become are very political organ .
But first , my disclosures .
I am not a breast cancer survivor .
I &apos;m not a radiologist .
She came to see me after discovering a breast lump .
Her sister had been diagnosed with breast cancer in her 40s .
Fortunately , her lump proved to be benign .
Radiologists were outraged by the guidelines .
But in my view , the radiologists are heroes .
But that very fact is telling .
The factor most responsible for that fire is breast density .
And that proportion is primarily genetically determined .
So how do you know if your breasts are dense ?
And breasts that fall into these two categories are considered dense .
But what else could I offer her ?
What about ultrasound ?
Think about iPods compared to stereos .
But it &apos;s the exact opposite in health care .
The machines get ever bigger and ever more expensive .
It &apos;s just way too much equipment .
One MRI scan costs 10 times what a digital mammogram costs .
It &apos;s like the essence of TED .
This is an image from our first patient .
This is our current detector .
And you can see that it looks a lot different .
So how does this work ?
But with MBI , we use just light , pain-free compression .
And the detector then transmits the image to the computer .
So here &apos;s an example .
Our big break came in 2004 .
MBI found 83 percent .
Here &apos;s an example from that screening study .
In this case , a one-centimeter tumor .
So this is not just young women that it &apos;s benefiting .
It &apos;s also older women with dense tissue .
MBI generates four images per breast .
MRI generates over a thousand .
First , know your density .
Of course we should .
We need to individualize screening based on density .
For women without dense breasts , mammography is the best choice .
Thank you .
Pranav Mistry : The thrilling potential of SixthSense technology
We grew up interacting with the physical objects around us .
It comes as a part of our everyday learning .
It had some strings and pulleys and some springs .
What we are interested in is information .
We want to know about things .
We want to know about dynamic things going around .
The camera is actually tracking all your gestures .
You can start painting on any wall .
But we are not only tracking one finger , here .
Thank you .
This was Obama &apos;s visit last week to MIT .
But the camera is actually tracking where my fingers are moving .
You can of course watch movies .
And why only computers ? We can just play with papers .
Paper world is interesting to play with .
That &apos;s all . Thank you .
Thank you .
This is incredible , really .
Or is this research forever , or what ?
Open source ? Wow .
PM : Yeah . Yes , yes , of course .
What are your plans ? MIT ?
It &apos;s an honor to have you at TED .
Thank you so much .
That &apos;s fantastic .
Kevin Stone : The bio-future of joint replacement
So let me just start with my story .
And it &apos;s not just aging that causes arthritis .
Let &apos;s consider an alternative path .
I &apos;m not ready for joint replacement . &quot;
And &#91; the allograft &#93; replaces &#91; the missing meniscus &#93; .
And so we can regrow these surfaces biologically .
Well the reason is because there &apos;s not enough donor cycles .
And the tissue &apos;s very expensive .
So my story in working with animal tissues starts in 1984 .
And that &apos;s great when I can degrade the tissue .
I can &apos;t grind it up in a blender .
And we call that a &quot; gal stripping &quot; technique .
What we do is humanize the tissue .
So what about the next step ?
How are we going to revolutionize artificial joint replacement ?
Well here &apos;s how we &apos;re going to do it .
So that &apos;s our biologic approach right now .
We &apos;re going to rebuild your knee with the parts .
We &apos;re going to resurface it with a completely new surface .
But we have other advantages from the animal kingdom .
There &apos;s a benefit of 400 million years of ambulation .
We can harness those benefits .
We can do it as an outpatient procedure .
And so welcome to super biologics .
It &apos;s not hardware .
It &apos;s not software .
It &apos;s bioware .
It &apos;s version 2.0 of you .
Thank you very much .
Marcel Dicke : Why not eat insects ?
That &apos;s quite a lot .
Because there &apos;s 80 percent out there that really eats insects .
But this is quite good .
Why not eat insects ? Well first , what are insects ?
Insects are animals that walk around on six legs .
And here you see just a selection .
It was 80 billion U.S. dollars .
Well we know that that was not a cheap war .
What do they do ?
They remove dung , they pollinate our crops .
They control pests , and they &apos;re food for animals .
They &apos;re at the start of food chains .
Small animals eat insects .
Even larger animals eat insects .
There &apos;s quite a lot of people that are eating insects .
And they prepare it in a wonderful way .
And you can eat something new everyday .
More than 1,000 species -- an enormous variety .
You &apos;re eating at least 500 grams per year .
What are you eating ?
Some fruits get some insect damage .
And that &apos;s your view of a tomato .
So anything is a good protein source already .
We &apos;re even doing this on purpose .
One gram of cochineal costs about 30 euros .
One gram of gold is 30 euros .
The human population is growing very rapidly and is growing exponentially .
How are we going to feed this world ?
And we eat quite a lot of it .
In the developing world it &apos;s much lower .
It &apos;s 25 kilograms per person per year .
But it &apos;s increasing enormously .
They have the same share that we have .
You &apos;ll get proteins in any kind of food anyway .
The first problem that we &apos;re facing is human health .
Pigs are quite like us .
That means that pigs also share diseases with us .
You get a new disease that can be deadly .
So that &apos;s one point for insects .
And there &apos;s the conversion factor .
We &apos;re not taking the bonus yet .
We &apos;re not taking the nine kilograms of output yet .
So that &apos;s two points for insects .
And there &apos;s the environment .
So less waste .
So that &apos;s three points for insects .
And even in terms of calories , it is very good .
So that &apos;s four points for insects .
So the question is , why not eat insects ?
I gave you at least four arguments in favor .
We &apos;ll have to .
On the right-hand side you see a grasshopper .
It &apos;s just very good food .
You can vary enormously .
It has many benefits .
Who wouldn &apos;t like to eat a shrimp ?
They are delicacies .
So why are we not eating insects yet ?
Well that &apos;s just a matter of mindset .
That &apos;s why we &apos;re changing the perception of insects .
If we die out , the insects will continue very happily .
And some might think , well they &apos;re not yet available .
Well they are .
And they &apos;re being made in the most wonderful ways .
A Dutch chocolate maker .
So there &apos;s even a lot of design to it .
And when she got all the Ministers of Agriculture of the E.U.
It &apos;s not something that is a hobby of mine .
It &apos;s really taken off the ground .
So why not eat insects ?
You should try it yourself .
Look at them first . Look at them first .
Marcel Dicke : It &apos;s all protein .
And it looks delicious .
They just make it &#91; with &#93; nuts or something .
MD : Thank you .
Cameron Sinclair : The refugees of boom-and-bust
1.1 million of them .
They pay a middle-man thousands of dollars to be there .
And then the financial collapse happened .
Currently , right now , thousands of workers are abandoned .
There is no way back home .
And there is no way , and no proof of arrival .
These are the boom-and-bust refugees .
So let &apos;s forget your environmental footprint .
Let &apos;s think about your ethical footprint .
Thank you .
Kevin Surace : Eco-friendly drywall
What &apos;s happening to the climate ?
It is unbelievably bad .
So we all look at what we can do .
Only nine percent is passenger cars , interestingly enough .
So we ran off to a sushi bar .
And it was something called EcoRock .
We started R &amp; amp ; D in 2006 .
Decided to use recycled content from cement and steel manufacturing .
And they worked absolutely very , very , very hard .
We did the line install over the summer .
We started right there , with absolutely nothing .
That &apos;s the finished production line there .
We got our first panel out on December third .
But this has a huge , huge impact on the environment .
And we &apos;ve got Cradle-to-Cradle Gold on this thing .
Thank you . Thank you .
We must change everything .
We &apos;re going as fast as we can .
Those are my kids , Natalie and David .
Thank you so much .
Shigeru Ban : Emergency shelters made from paper
Hi . I am an architect .
Then I built the temporary structure , 1990 .
This is the first temporary building made out of paper .
So it &apos;s very useful .
Year 2000 , there was a big expo in Germany .
My goal of the design is not when it &apos;s completed .
After , the building was recycled .
So that was the goal of my design .
We stayed there for six years without paying any rent .
Thank you . I had one big problem .
That was the problem .
Then I completed the Pompidou Center in Metz .
They have money and power .
Those are invisible .
But I must say they are no longer natural disasters .
That &apos;s the responsibility of architects .
We can make it better .
So that is why I started working in disaster areas .
1994 , there was a big disaster in Rwanda , Africa .
Two tribes , Hutu and Tutsi , fought each other .
Over two million people became refugees .
But over two million people cut trees .
It just became big , heavy deforestation and an environmental problem .
That is why they started providing aluminum pipes , aluminum barracks .
And he said , &quot; Oh God , are you crazy ?
After a fire , what are you proposing ? &quot;
So I proposed to rebuild . I raised -- did fundraising .
The color coordination is very important .
So I remember it was so disappointing .
Finally the priest , finally he trusted me to rebuild .
So we spent five weeks rebuilding the church .
It stayed there in Taiwan as a permanent church even now .
So this building became a permanent building .
2001 , in West India , I built also a shelter .
I was asked to rebuild the temporary church .
I brought my Japanese students to work with the Chinese students .
And they are very kind , affording my model .
And I was very lucky .
But look at this . There &apos;s no privacy .
People suffer mentally and physically .
But it &apos;s really necessary to do it .
So I proposed to the mayor while I was making partitions .
Many of the people want to stay here forever .
I was very happy to hear that .
Now I am working in New Zealand , Christchurch .
And I was asked to come to rebuild the temporary cathedral .
So this is under construction .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Neil Burgess : How your brain tells you where you are
Here &apos;s the problem facing Homer .
Place cells are also being recorded in humans .
And when you expand the box , the firing location expands .
But we also know where we are through movement .
Do people have grid cells ?
So back to Homer .
And that would be represented by the firing of boundary-detecting cells .
Maybe it &apos;s been towed .
And grid cells could move this viewpoint through that space .
Thank you very much .
Nigel Marsh : How to make work-life balance work
We should stop looking outside .
I &apos;m talking about all companies .
Have sex .
Walk the dog .
Have breakfast with my wife and children .
Have sex again .
Drive the kids to school on the way to the office .
Do three hours &apos; work .
Play a sport with a friend at lunchtime .
Do another three hours &apos; work .
Meet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink .
Drive home for dinner with my wife and kids .
Meditate for half an hour .
Have sex .
Walk the dog . Have sex again .
Go to bed .
How often do you think I have that day ?
We need to be realistic .
You can &apos;t do it all in one day .
There &apos;s got to be a middle way .
And I realize that my life is completely out of balance .
It &apos;s totally dominated by work .
All of my relationships have failed .
There &apos;s nothing in my life apart from my work .
So I joined a gym . &quot;
Now that can be daunting .
And I understand .
I truly understand how that can be daunting .
Now my point is the small things matter .
Being more balanced doesn &apos;t mean dramatic upheaval in your life .
Moreover , I think , it can transform society .
And that , I think , is an idea worth spreading .
Sam Harris : Science can answer moral questions
&quot; What is worth dying for ? &quot;
&quot; What constitutes a good life ? &quot;
But I think this is quite clearly untrue .
Values are a certain kind of fact .
They are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures .
Why don &apos;t we feel compassion for rocks ?
Would adding cholera to the water be a good idea ?
Probably not .
And morality relates to these truths .
So , in talking about values we are talking about facts .
And these await our discovery .
We &apos;re not talking about Connecticut .
And the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious .
Well , consider by analogy , the concept of physical health .
The concept of physical health is undefined .
It &apos;s now around 80 in the developed world .
People will send you donations when you &apos;re in that condition .
Now , why wouldn &apos;t this undermine an objective morality ?
There is clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food .
But there &apos;s nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison .
Why would we think this ?
Consider , by analogy , the game of chess .
But it clearly admits some exceptions .
And yet , chess is a domain of perfect objectivity .
Well , who are we not to say this ?
What are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing ?
Now , what stands in the way of this ?
He likes chocolate , he likes vanilla .
Notice that we don &apos;t do this in science .
On the left you have Edward Witten .
He &apos;s a string theorist .
I &apos;m not a fan . &quot;
I &apos;m the Ted Bundy of string theory .
But this is just the point .
Whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded .
That is what it is to have a domain of expertise .
That is what it is for knowledge to count .
How have we convinced ourselves that every opinion has to count ?
Just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality .
Thank you very much .
So , some combustible material there .
Language seems to be really important here .
But can you reconcile that ?
So , everything is not going to be up for grabs .
Do people love their daughters just as much in these systems ?
And I think there are clearly right answers to that .
SH : Really an honor . Thank you .
Kathryn Schulz : On being wrong
My friend looks at me totally blankly .
And what I &apos;m talking about is this .
Right , the famous Chinese character for picnic area .
We get it in the abstract .
We all know everybody in this room makes mistakes .
I think this is a problem .
And second , why it &apos;s such a problem .
Dreadful . Thumbs down .
Embarrassing . Okay , wonderful , great .
But just being wrong doesn &apos;t feel like anything .
I &apos;ll give you an analogy .
That &apos;s when he falls .
So I should actually correct something I said a moment ago .
I call this error blindness .
Think back for a moment to elementary school .
This is not mine , by the way .
We learn these really bad lessons really well .
Right , Mr. CFO , astrophysicist , ultra-marathoner ?
Okay , so fine .
So let me tell you a story .
Beth Israel &apos;s in Boston .
Everything seems to have gone fine .
So this is a huge practical problem .
But it &apos;s also a huge social problem .
Think for a moment about what it means to feel right .
So this is a catastrophe .
And yeah , it is also why we get things wrong .
It &apos;s totally fundamental to who we are .
And my first thought was , &quot; I &apos;ve lost it .
I &apos;ve become the crazy wrongness lady .
I just imagined it everywhere , &quot; which has happened .
When it comes to our stories , we love being wrong .
And something else happened instead .
And something else happened instead .
And something else happened instead .
And something else happened instead .
I mean , this is life .
Didn &apos;t really work out that way , did it ?
Where &apos;s my jet pack , Chris ?
So here we are again .
And that &apos;s how it goes .
We come up with another idea .
We tell another story .
We hold another conference .
Maybe I &apos;m wrong . &quot;
Thank you .
Thank you guys .
Neil MacGregor : 2600 years of history in one object
It doesn &apos;t , I agree , look very much .
It &apos;s about the size of a rugby ball .
And you all know roughly the story .
Not only the Jews , he &apos;d taken the temple vessels .
He &apos;d ransacked , desecrated the temple .
Belshazzar , his son , decides to have a feast .
And Cyrus makes a declaration .
They &apos;re not shy of hyperbole as you can see .
So the hyperbole is not actually surprising .
He &apos;ll let them return to their countries .
It &apos;s a central document in Jewish history .
This is the Jewish version of the same story .
Who is there among you of his people ?
Two great texts , what about the politics ?
Cyrus begins in the 530s BC .
It was the largest empire the world had known until then .
And it had to be run in a quite new way .
It had to be run in different languages .
The fact that this decree is in Babylonian says one thing .
All of those are respected by Cyrus .
The Greek invasions ended that .
But what Cyrus represented remained absolutely central .
And throughout European culture afterward , Cyrus remained the model .
And it enters now another story .
No other evidence .
Suddenly , this appeared .
It &apos;s a great 19th century moment .
It can only be Jehovah .
The question is , which god was it ?
That &apos;s 1879 .
You all know what happened .
And another story of the cylinder begins .
Cyrus cylinder : guarantor of the Shah .
10 years later , another story : Iranian Revolution , 1979 .
Then another Iran-Iraq war .
And the obvious emblem is Cyrus .
It &apos;s the only object they want .
They want to borrow the Cyrus cylinder .
It was a huge event .
This is the other side of that same picture .
This is beyond any blockbuster exhibition in the West .
Is Iran still to be the defender of the oppressed ?
It was a narrative presented by the president himself .
It stands with the American constitution .
It certainly says far more about real freedoms than Magna Carta .
A replica of this is at the United Nations .
Thank you .
Joshua Klein : A thought experiment on the intelligence of crows
Any of you get really freaked out by that ?
You might want to leave now .
So , this is a vending machine for crows .
We gotta kill them because they &apos;re making a mess .
And he said that was impossible .
So I did .
They &apos;d become extremely adept at living with us .
And in doing so , we were breeding them for parasitism .
So , for example , rats are incredibly responsive breeders .
And so I built the vending machine .
We &apos;re seeing a population boom with crows .
So that &apos;s no great surprise .
And I &apos;ll give you an example of that .
So this is Betty . She &apos;s a New Caledonian crow .
But the researchers had a problem .
And she hadn &apos;t had the opportunity to do this before .
You see , it wasn &apos;t working very well .
So she adapted .
But she did it all on her own .
So keep in mind that she &apos;s never seen this done .
Right .
Yeah . All right .
That &apos;s the part where the researchers freak out .
It &apos;s pretty annoying for the fishermen .
And the next month . And after summer break .
So -- the moral being , don &apos;t piss off crows .
It &apos;s fairly interesting .
Wait for the light to stop the traffic .
Then , collect your cracked nut in safety .
Joshua Klein : Yeah , yeah . Pretty interesting .
In fact , that &apos;s old hat for crows .
Parents seem to be teaching their young .
The point being that they &apos;ve developed cultural adaptation .
So we know that there &apos;s lots of crows .
So that &apos;s what we did .
This is a vending machine for crows .
It &apos;s pretty simple .
And eventually , they eat up all the peanuts .
Then you can come back anytime and get yourself a peanut .
And so this goes on for some time .
Come back , look for the peanut , go away .
They figure it &apos;s gotta have more to it .
And then , we &apos;re off to the races .
Instead , I think we should look a little bit larger .
I think that crows can be trained to do other things .
Or find expensive components from discarded electronics ?
Or maybe do search and rescue ?
Thanks very much .
David Logan : Tribal leadership
Now , I want to tell you a quick story .
We &apos;ll go back a little more than a year .
It was February 3rd , 2008 .
Anyone remember what happened , February 3rd , 2008 ?
And they had discussed things of great national importance .
Like , &quot; Do we like the Budweiser commercial ? &quot;
All of you are members of tribes .
That is in fact what great tribal leaders do .
So here is the bottom line .
And so people form tribes .
They always have . They always will .
But here &apos;s the rub .
Now here is the net out of this .
You &apos;re all a member of tribes .
Now , this is the lowest of the stages .
You don &apos;t want this . Okay ?
Stage One produces people who do horrible things .
This is the kid who shot up Virginia Tech .
It &apos;s not enough to simply write people off .
But let &apos;s move on to Stage Two .
It will be despairing hostility .
Actually , no , I &apos;m not .
But I &apos;m saying the culture makes people dumb .
You find them in all places in society .
What kind of innovation would get done ?
The amount of world-changing behavior that would happen ?
In fact it would be basically nil .
Because it is in Stage Three that many of us move .
And we park . And we stay .
I &apos;m great and you &apos;re not .
And the elevator door opened , and they all walked out .
That is a meeting of a Stage Three tribe .
Like , oh , I don &apos;t know , TEDx USC .
Here is the greatest challenge we face in innovation .
It is moving from Stage Three to Stage Four .
Let &apos;s take a look at a quick video snippet .
It was not Christmas time . There was a Christmas tree .
This is their lobby .
Employees volunteer time in the advice booth .
Notice it looks like something out of a Peanuts cartoon .
Okay , we &apos;re going through the hallway here at Zappos .
This is a call center . Notice how it &apos;s decorated .
Notice people are applauding for us .
But you &apos;ll notice the level of excitement .
Notice , again , how they decorate their office .
But they value things like fun . And they value creativity .
And you &apos;ll notice they are a little bit weird .
Stage Four tribes can do remarkable things .
There is , in fact , another stage .
In fact , South Africa has not gone down that road .
We &apos;re great ! Who is not great ? England ! &quot;
Sorry .
Well , what about other great leaders ? What about Gandhi ?
What about Martin Luther King ?
Just one little bit of happiness and joy after another .
Two percent are at Stage One .
And our values are beginning to unite us . &quot;
And those are the ones that change the world .
I &apos;d like to show you some examples of this .
And he grew up essentially in Stage One .
I don &apos;t know anybody .
In fact , that &apos;s progress .
So , what about moving from Stage Three to Stage Four ?
I want to argue that we &apos;re doing that right here .
That &apos;s called a triadic relationship .
See , people who build world-changing tribes do that .
And ultimately that adds to their values .
You know they do polls , right ?
Pretty much everybody else who does polls .
So , they were bored .
And they found a way to do the first-ever world poll .
Incidentally , they did pull it off .
And they released the first-ever world poll .
So I &apos;d like to leave you with these thoughts .
You remember to talk all five culture stages .
Because we &apos;ve got people in all five , around us .
Thank you very much .
Frederick Balagadde : Bio-lab on a microchip
This is the most devastating epidemic of our time .
This is already beginning to happen in Sub-Saharan Africa .
I experienced this firsthand as a high school student in Uganda .
We all know about the miracle of miniaturization .
This is a microfluidic chip that I developed .
Thank you very much .
Jonathan Drori : The beautiful tricks of flowers
Do you know how many species of flowering plants there are ?
And flowers are a real bugger .
They &apos;re really difficult for plants to produce .
Why would they go to that bother ?
Evolution works that way .
Now the way that plants transmit that information is through pollen .
Some of you may have seen some of these pictures before .
And that &apos;s actually rather useful for forensics and so on .
There are markings on many plants that look like other insects .
And they get up to all sorts of tricks .
They have to try and attract pollinators to do their bidding .
And sure enough , there &apos;s the insect .
Now this is a plant .
And this is the mimic .
So this is a plant that is mimicking the first plant .
Now deceit carries on through the plant kingdom .
Sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect , even to us .
It &apos;s a wonderful , amazing thing .
This one &apos;s clever . It &apos;s called obsidian .
I think of it as insidium sometimes .
And this one doesn &apos;t have anything for them .
So it &apos;s deceiving on two levels -- fabulous .
Here we see ylang ylang , the component of many perfumes .
I actually smelt someone with some on earlier .
And the flowers don &apos;t really have to be that gaudy .
This one doesn &apos;t smell so good .
So flies love this .
They fly in and they pollinate .
It &apos;s really horrible .
And blowflies just can &apos;t help themselves .
I photographed this thing last week in Dorset .
This is the philodendron selloum .
This is the most amazing thing .
That sort of phallic bit there is about a foot long .
This thing does something else which is unusual .
There &apos;s a thermoregulation mechanism in there that keeps constant temperature .
And they get inside , and they get it all on .
And what a wonderful thing it is .
So there &apos;s something that goes on off the end there .
Well yes we can .
So what is an insect seeing ?
And this is what it looks like with visible light .
Most bees don &apos;t perceive red .
And that &apos;s a real fantastic bull &apos;s eye .
So maybe the chemical in that would be useful .
And I love the idea of something hidden .
That &apos;s the main use of that filter .
Thank you very much .
Srdja Popovic : How to topple a dictator
Good afternoon . I am proud to be here at TEDxKrakow .
Here it is . It is December 15 , 2010 .
But you need to share it with the world . Okay ?
Curiosity killed the cat . You take the bet .
Next thing you know , two guys in white appear .
Well , people power has been there for a while .
It helped Gandhi kick the Brits from India .
It helped Martin Luther King win a historic racial struggle .
If this is true , we can help these movements .
Well , first one , analytic skills .
What is the average age of Egyptians ? 24 .
How long was Mubarak in power ? 31 .
It seems that Generation Epsilon is coming .
Now let me set another example .
And , I mean , there is a set of conditions .
Let me give you the example .
I am coming from a country called Serbia .
Guess what ? That was the day of his defeat .
They appear on the street only with the flag of Egypt .
I will give you a counter-example .
You see nine presidential candidates running against Lukashenko .
You will know the outcome .
That thing doesn &apos;t exist in the world .
If you maintain nonviolent discipline , you will exclusively win .
One single act of violence can literally destroy your movement .
Now let me move to another place .
It &apos;s selection of strategies and tactics .
There are certain rules in nonviolent struggle you may follow .
First , you start small .
Second , you pick the battles you can win .
It &apos;s only 200 of us in this room .
We won &apos;t call for the March of Millions .
They &apos;re very useful in a violent oppression .
So it works like in a video game .
You have a fear high , you have status quo .
You have enthusiasm higher , you see fear starting to melt .
In Egypt , you can tell that something is happening there .
Well , that &apos;s just the beginning of the show .
The real show starts when the police appears .
We are three blocks away observing it from our espresso bar .
Arrest the shoppers with kids ? Doesn &apos;t make sense .
When you start to mock them , it hurts .
Don &apos;t mix tools with the substance .
But here is also the bad news .
Are they going to become the world wave ?
This is the difference between two towns .
Now , what &#91; do &#93; the statistics have ?
This is one more reason to look at this phenomenon .
Thank you .
Gordon Brown : Wiring a web for global good
This is Tiananmen Square .
And what do all these pictures and events have in common ?
They protested across Britain .
They won public opinion over a long period of time .
But it took 24 years for the campaign to be successful .
Now look at what &apos;s happened in the last 10 years .
200 years ago the problem we had to solve was slavery .
My husband too has spent a long time in prison . &quot;
We cannot solve these problems unless we work together .
Take the financial crisis .
I have just been talking to the President of Sierra Leone .
There is a photograph of a boy called David .
Beside that photograph there is the information about his life .
It said &quot; David , age 10 . &quot;
David : ambition to be a doctor .
Favorite sport : football . What did he enjoy most ?
Making people laugh .
How did he die ?
Tortured to death .
And we never did .
So my argument today is basically this .
They said , &quot; Let &apos;s march . &quot;
We should be marching towards a global society .
Thank you .
Oliver Sacks : What hallucination reveals about our minds
And seeing with the brain is often called imagination .
They don &apos;t seem to be of our creation .
They don &apos;t seem to be under our control .
I went in to see her .
So I said , &quot; What sort of things ? &quot;
A man who turns towards me and smiles .
But he has huge teeth on one side of his mouth .
Animals too .
Then , one night , the scene changes .
I see cats and dogs walking towards me .
They come to a certain point and then stop .
Then it changes again .
I said , &quot; Is this like a dream ? &quot;
But it &apos;s completely silent , like a silent movie . &quot;
And she said that it &apos;s a rather boring movie .
And she has a sense of humor .
She knew it was a hallucination .
She had no control over them .
And she didn &apos;t know what was going on .
She wondered if she was going mad or losing her mind .
Well , I examined her carefully .
She wasn &apos;t on any medications which could produce hallucinations .
But she was blind .
And you have Charles Bonnet syndrome .
You have Charles Bonnet syndrome . &quot;
She said , &quot; Who is this Charles Bonnet ? &quot;
She said , &quot; Did he have them himself ? &quot;
Well , so I did tell the nurses .
Now this , for me , is a common situation .
I work in old-age homes , largely .
About 10 percent of the hearing impaired people get musical hallucinations .
His grandfather had these hallucinations .
His grandfather was a magistrate , an elderly man .
He &apos;d had cataract surgery .
His vision was pretty poor .
It was a large blue handkerchief with four orange circles .
And he knew it was a hallucination .
You don &apos;t have handkerchiefs in midair .
And then he saw a big wheel in midair .
And then the handsome young men disappeared .
They don &apos;t usually fade in and out .
They are rather sudden , and they change suddenly .
That was the only figure he recognized .
This repetition of perception is sometimes called palinopsia .
And you start to see things .
The things you see can be very complicated indeed .
She had very mobile hallucinations as well .
A lot of them had to do with a car .
Another patient of mine had a different sort of hallucination .
And , above all , she would see cartoons .
And especially she saw cartoons of Kermit the Frog .
You know , I was wondering about Freudian determinants .
Why Kermit ?
Kermit the Frog means nothing to me . &quot;
She didn &apos;t mind the cartoons too much .
And these frightened her .
Well , what is going on with these people ?
They seduce you . They humiliate you .
They jeer at you .
You interact with them .
You &apos;re at a particular road junction .
You smell chestnuts roasting .
You hear the traffic . All the senses are involved .
And you &apos;re waiting for your girl .
And it &apos;s that Tuesday evening back in 1982 .
The Charles Bonnet ones are quite different .
And one of the second commonest is cartoons .
So , what is going on ?
You don &apos;t form images with your primary visual cortex .
It &apos;s very interesting that that should be specific .
&quot; Face cells &quot; were discovered around 1970 .
I saw an Aston Martin this morning .
I had to bring it in .
And now it &apos;s in there somewhere .
Suddenly this , and suddenly that .
&quot; Kermit means nothing to me . &quot;
You don &apos;t get anywhere thinking of them as dreams .
Well , I &apos;ve more or less said what I wanted .
Think of the number of blind people .
Thanks very much .
That was superb . Thank you so much .
Have you yourself experienced any of the syndromes you write about ?
Oliver Sacks : I was afraid you &apos;d ask that .
Well , yeah , a lot of them .
And actually I &apos;m a little visually impaired myself .
And I see the geometrical hallucinations .
But they stop there .
And they don &apos;t disturb you ?
That was an utterly , utterly fascinating talk .
Thank you so much for sharing .
OS : Thank you . Thank you .
Bart Weetjens : How I taught rats to sniff out land mines
As a child , I had two passions .
One was a passion for rodents .
I also had a passion for Africa .
Africa was truly fascinating for me .
We &apos;re talking &apos; 95 now .
We chose rats .
Why would you choose rats ?
Because , aren &apos;t they vermin ?
And actually , our product -- what you see here .
There &apos;s a target somewhere here .
There , the animal finds a mine .
It scratches on the soil .
And the animal comes back for a food reward .
Very , very simple .
Very sustainable in this environment .
Here , the animal gets its food reward .
And that &apos;s how it works .
Very , very simple .
Now why would you use rats ?
They &apos;re extremely sensitive to smell .
Now how do we communicate with rats ?
This consists of 400 square meters .
Question of scale .
We have a demonstration site in Mozambique .
But let me bring you to a very different problem .
You can actually cure T.B. , even in HIV-positives .
So in our common language , Dutch , the name for T.B.
So how does it work ?
You have a cassette with 10 samples .
You put these 10 samples at once in the cage .
Here it &apos;s already at the third sample .
This is a positive sample .
It gets a click sound and comes for the food reward .
But let &apos;s stick first to tuberculosis .
Microscopy for 1,800 patients .
So this is really considerable .
At least our hero rats have saved lots of lives .
The way forward for us is now to standardize this technology .
So , to standardize this .
To conclude , there are also other applications at the horizon .
This is in a prototype stage .
We don &apos;t have a working system here yet .
Thank you very much .
Amy Tan : Where does creativity hide ?
The Value of Nothing : Out of Nothing Comes Something .
OK .
And I had a miniature poodle .
Everything except randomness . She did not believe in randomness .
There was a reason for everything .
You become very creative , in a survival sense .
And this , then , led to my big questions .
And they &apos;re the same ones that I have today .
And this happens constantly in the writing .
You won &apos;t discover anything .
And they all operate at the same time .
There is also a big question of ambiguity .
And I would link that to something called the cosmological constant .
A very famous Chinese saying , she said .
And then we have intentions .
What are we supposed to do ?
I got these hints everywhere .
And what I need , in effect , is a focus .
And when I have the question , it is a focus .
And it seems like it &apos;s happening all the time .
And you are noticing it more often .
But you apply this .
Why or why not ?
This leads to this question .
It seems so obvious , and yet it is not .
Sometimes I get help from the universe , it seems .
And I needed to find something historically that would match that .
You wonder , are these things random chance ?
And that goes into the story , too .
A big thing that I also think about is accidents .
What is the nature of accidents ?
60 homes were destroyed , and 40 were damaged .
Responsibility was assigned to the family .
It &apos;s the son , not the father . &quot;
And so I was there on three occasions , different seasons .
And how do I create my own life ?
So , there are never complete answers .
There she is .
Thank you very much !
Andrew Fitzgerald : Adventures in Twitter fiction
But I want to start and go back to the 1930s .
And from those single points emanated stories .
Some of them were familiar stories .
Some of them were new stories .
Think about episodes that happened live on radio .
There are thousands upon thousands of them .
Every single one of these points is its own broadcaster .
I believe this starts with an evolution of existing methods .
He was able to write and publish in relatively short order .
There was no mediator between him and the audience .
So this whole project was an experiment .
It was originally written specifically with Twitter in mind .
Now Twitter , of course , has a 140-character limit .
I think that &apos;s pretty exciting : tune-in literary fiction .
when this woman falls to her death .
These three characters brought an authentic vision from multiple perspectives .
It was also Twitter as a production mechanism .
All of these are rapid iterations on a theme .
Keep in mind , they &apos;re all Democrats .
And they engage with the real world .
They respond to it .
So during the Chicago mayoral election there was a parody account .
It was Mayor Emanuel .
I double checked the newspapers .
And then , very interestingly , it came to an end .
It ended , a true narrative conclusion .
And I think this is an interesting experiment in format .
In this particular case , he &apos;s talking about drone strikes .
Thank you .
Rachelle Garniez : &quot; La Vie en Rose &quot;
Catherine Bracy : Why good hackers make good citizens
I &apos;m going to talk about hackers .
It &apos;s about critical thinking .
It &apos;s about questioning existing ways of doing things .
And in many ways , hacking is what built America .
Betsy Ross was a hacker .
The Underground Railroad was a brilliant hack .
So keep that in mind .
All of you are potential civic hackers .
So what does civic hacking look like ?
They asked citizens to write the content .
So you &apos;ve heard of a hack-a-thon .
I authored this answer , and a few others .
They actually love it .
And the contract was a two-year contract for 9.3 million dollars .
They can actually build government .
We have 31 brigades in the U.S.
So please come hack with us .
Thank you .
Ananda Shankar Jayant : Fighting cancer with dance
I heard the word &quot; carcinoma . &quot;
Yes , breast cancer .
I thought I knew what fear was .
That day , I learned what fear was .
Is this the end of my dance ? &quot;
I needed something that would pull me out of all this .
But it wasn &apos;t easy .
Believe me , it definitely wasn &apos;t easy .
All I wanted to do was curl up and weep .
It was excruciatingly painful , but I did it .
Difficult .
But I needed something else .
The metaphor of Mahishasura Mardhini , of Durga .
Durga , the epitome of creative feminine energy , or shakti .
Durga , the fearless one .
Yes , cancer has just been one page in my life .
My story is the power of thought .
My story is the power of choice .
It &apos;s the power of focus .
My story is the power of a metaphor .
It &apos;s the power of an image .
Mine was that of Durga , Durga the fearless one .
Thomas Dolby : &quot; Love Is a Loaded Pistol &quot;
And that was largely because there weren &apos;t any .
And I can light up the Nutmeg like a beacon .
It &apos;s about Billie Holiday .
But I know where she was .
She was with me on my lifeboat .
And she was hot .
Jeremy Gilley : One day of peace
And when I was 12 , I became an actor .
I was told I was dyslexic .
In fact , I have got qualifications .
And so concern is where all of this comes from .
And then I thought , well maybe I could do something .
Maybe I could become a filmmaker .
Maybe there &apos;s a little change I can get involved in .
Because it &apos;s obviously incredibly frightening .
And that was when I had the idea .
There was no starting point for peace .
There was no day of global unity .
There was no day of intercultural cooperation .
So obviously we didn &apos;t have any money .
I was living at my mom &apos;s place .
And we started writing letters to everybody .
He was a prisoner of war .
He saw the bomb go off at Nagasaki .
It poisoned his blood . He died when I was 11 .
So he was like my hero .
And very quickly , some letters started coming back .
And we started to build this case .
And I remember the first letter .
One of the first letters was from the Dalai Lama .
And we didn &apos;t have money for the flight .
And then Dr. Oscar Arias came forward .
And we invited everybody , and no press showed up .
And that was kind of like the launch of this thing .
For me , it was really about the process .
It wasn &apos;t about the end result .
And that &apos;s the beautiful thing about the camera .
So anyway , we began the journey .
Yeah , I &apos;m not worried about it now .
76 countries in the last 12 years , I &apos;ve visited .
I &apos;ve recorded 44,000 young people .
I &apos;ve recorded about 900 hours of their thoughts .
And we were listening to everybody .
And it was an incredibly thing , working with the U.N.
and working with NGOs and building this case .
I don &apos;t know how to get involved in that process .
And thank you to all of them .
That was an incredible moment .
And suddenly , we started to institutionalize this day .
And it was 8 : 00 AM when I stood there .
It never happened .
And we have to make this day work .
It &apos;s been created ; nobody knows .
And I left New York freaked , but actually empowered .
I remember putting that film out and going to cynics .
It &apos;s just symbolism .
Children can lead their projects .
That &apos;s what I &apos;d heard .
And so I went back to the United Nations .
I decided that I &apos;d continue filming and make another movie .
And then UNAMA became involved in Afghanistan .
I won &apos;t go into that .
It &apos;d be really interesting if you came .
It would help and bring attention .
I think there &apos;s a number of pillars to success .
One is you &apos;ve got to have a great idea .
So these guys were absolutely crucial .
So he said yes , and we found ourselves in Afghanistan .
There was an interest in what was going on .
And her Afghan network was just absolutely everywhere .
And she was really crucial in getting the message in .
We had to wait now and see what happened .
We will observe this day .
We see it as a window of opportunity .
And we gave the film over .
Obviously it was shown , and it was amazing .
They were saying they would stop .
70 percent reduction in violence on this day at least .
And that completely blew my mind almost more than anything .
And I was there thinking about what was going on .
And I kept thinking about this 70 percent .
We have to go for a global truce .
That &apos;s exactly what we must do .
And you can see the education box there .
And obviously the life-saving is increased , the concepts help .
Ultimately , that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . &quot;
We &apos;ll make a new film about this process .
We &apos;ll utilize sport and football .
So , utilizing all of these ways to inspire individual action .
And ultimately , we have to try that .
We have to work together .
I was with Brahimi , Ambassador Brahimi .
He &apos;s an amazing man .
And I sat with him a few weeks ago .
He said , &quot; It &apos;s absolutely possible . &quot;
I said , &quot; What would you do ?
It &apos;s all about the individuals .
It &apos;s all about you and me .
It &apos;s all about partnerships .
It &apos;s about your constituencies ; it &apos;s about your businesses .
By working together , we can create peace one day .
Thank you TED . Thank you .
Thank you .
Thanks a lot .
Thank you very much . Thank you .
&quot; A lesbian girl . &quot;
I know you know a lot of endocrinology . &quot;
This wasn &apos;t rocket science .
And so he did .
Right ?
Does this make so-and-so straight ?
I was getting sexual orientation confused with gender identity .
And the data show it .
So what to do ?
And they fall apart .
That &apos;s how good it can be .
They look normal . They had normal heights .
in a crowd .
Well , where were these kids before ?
They were out there suffering , is where they were .
So we started a program in 2007 .
And since then , we have 160 patients .
Did they come from Afghanistan ? No .
And some came from England .
Jackie had been abused in the Midlands , in England .
It was a horror show .
They had to homeschool her .
And yet , she had just begun a male puberty .
And so here she is at 16 , on the left .
They will do it at 18 now .
And on the far right , there she is .
She went public , semifinalist in the Miss England competition .
The judges debated as to , can they do this ?
And she &apos;s become a remarkable spokeswoman .
Go figure .
So this picture , I think , says it all .
It really says it all .
He &apos;s got a prominent Adam &apos;s apple .
Now Nicole is on estrogen .
She has a bit of a form to her .
And then they finally got it .
So where do we go from here ?
We need less expensive drugs .
They cost a fortune .
And we need to get this condition out of the DSM .
And this isn &apos;t going to break anybody &apos;s budget .
This is not that common .
Thank you .
Melinda Gates : What nonprofits can learn from Coca-Cola
Coke is everywhere .
And I &apos;m not the first person to ask this question .
It &apos;s staggering , if you think about Coca-Cola .
They sell 1.5 billion servings every single day .
So why does this matter ?
So let &apos;s start with the data .
They have this very continuous feedback loop .
They have a whole team called &quot; Knowledge and Insight . &quot;
It &apos;s a lot like other consumer companies .
Let &apos;s contrast that for a minute to development .
Real-time data turns on the lights .
So what &apos;s the second thing that Coke &apos;s good at ?
They &apos;re good at tapping into that local entrepreneurial talent .
Let &apos;s look at the development side .
What is it that governments and NGOs can learn from Coke ?
Now , think about how this can change people &apos;s lives .
So what &apos;s the next step for Ethiopia ?
Well , they &apos;re already starting talk about this .
The third component of Coke &apos;s success is marketing .
Well , it &apos;s aspirational .
Coke &apos;s global campaign slogan is &quot; Open Happiness . &quot;
But they localize it .
Now , that played itself out in the World Cup campaign .
So how does health and development market ?
Well , it &apos;s based on avoidance , not aspirations .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ve heard some of these messages .
&quot; Use a condom , don &apos;t get AIDS . &quot;
&quot; Wash you hands , you might not get diarrhea . &quot;
And I think that &apos;s a mistake .
One example is sanitation .
But there &apos;s a solution : you build a toilet .
People reuse it for a slab for their home .
They sometimes store grain in it .
I &apos;ve even seen it used for a chicken coop .
Well , you work with the community .
And it works -- look at these headlines .
I &apos;m not kidding .
Women are refusing to marry men without toilets .
No loo , no &quot; I do . &quot;
But more importantly , it saves lives .
And can you guess what the young men are waiting for ?
They &apos;re waiting to be circumcised .
Can you you believe that ?
Well , why is all of this so important ?
In 2009 , we &apos;re down to 1,600 cases .
Well how did that happen ?
Let &apos;s look at a country like India .
They have two and a half million vaccinators .
Now it could have come from one of two places .
So many more people would have been affected .
So what &apos;s the endgame ?
It &apos;s not the marketing on the ground .
We have a problem with marketing in the donor community .
And we are so close .
And this victory is so possible .
To me , that is deep happiness .
Thank you .
JoAnn Kuchera-Morin : Stunning data visualization in the AlloSphere
Our scientist colleagues are finding new patterns in the information .
This first project is called the AlloBrain .
You &apos;re flying through the cortex of my colleague &apos;s brain .
They &apos;re mining blood density levels .
And they &apos;re reporting them back to you sonically .
You view the bond in the triangle .
We think it makes a beautiful structural art .
Oxygen , hydrogen and zinc have their own signature .
And you &apos;re going to hear an undulation between the sound .
This is actually a light emitter .
They &apos;re starting to find new mathematical structures in these calculations .
And they &apos;re understanding more about quantum mathematics .
This will be the final project that I show you .
You &apos;re actually seeing and hearing quantum information flow .
Thank you very much .
Ben Saunders : Why bother leaving the house ?
I &apos;m usually introduced as a polar explorer .
The pithiest answer to the question &quot; why ? &quot;
Now I &apos;m not actually sure that he did say that .
There is not the slightest prospect of any gain whatsoever .
We don &apos;t live to eat and make money .
We eat and make money to be able to enjoy life .
There was a bit of fun , a bit of joy .
And that journey lasted 10 weeks , 72 days .
Beyond that , I didn &apos;t see anyone for 10 weeks .
NASA described conditions that year as the worst since records began .
And I would add a cautionary note here , however .
Many of you will know the story .
This is a photo of Captain Scott and his team .
Is there a chance you &apos;ll see her there ? &quot;
But Scott &apos;s journey remains unfinished .
So that &apos;s precisely what I &apos;m setting out to do .
We have to turn around and come back again .
Thank you very much .
Tal Golesworthy : How I repaired my own heart
I &apos;m a process engineer .
This is an inherited disorder .
Everyone in here will be between 3.2 and 3.6 cm .
I was already up at 4.4 .
The thought of the surgery was not attractive .
The thought of the warfarin was really quite frightening .
I can do this . I can change this .
The project aim is really quite simple .
So the possibility exists to simply externally wrap the pipe .
And it would remain stable and operate quite happily .
So where do we start ?
Well this is a sagittal slice through me .
This is a model of my aorta .
You can see , it &apos;s quite a complex structure .
So it &apos;s quite a difficult structure to produce .
So this is absolutely personalized medicine at its best really .
Every patient we do has an absolutely bespoke implant .
Once you &apos;ve made it , the installation &apos;s quite easy .
Happy , away I went .
So the surgical implantation actually was the easiest part .
No breaking into your circulatory system .
So it really is great .
And even worse , it inevitably foreshortens your life .
Well the answer to that is a multidisciplinary team .
This is a list of the core team .
Jargon is a big one .
The engineers amongst you will recognize rapid prototyping and CAD .
Our disciplinary conventions were funny as well .
In the medical world they look up at plans .
So the horizontal images were all an inversion .
So one needs to be careful with disciplinary conventions .
Institutional barriers were another serious headache in the project .
I &apos;m sure it &apos;s the same in Poland .
And they made extra problems for us .
You &apos;ll have an equivalent in Poland , no doubt .
We had to get past the NICE problem .
We now have a great clinical guidance out on the Net .
Funding barriers : Another big area to be concerned with .
It must be rubbish . They binned it .
I &apos;ve coined a phrase &quot; obstructive conservatism . &quot;
They don &apos;t want to change .
They simply want to do whatever they &apos;ve done before .
And in fact , there are many surgeons in the U.K.
We &apos;ve actually got 30 patients .
I &apos;m at seven and a half years .
It really is a problem . It really is a problem .
You &apos;ve got to express support for them .
Tom Treasure , professor of cardiothoracic surgery : incredible guy .
Dead easy to give him respect .
Him giving me respect ? Slightly different .
That &apos;s all the bad news .
The good news is the benefits are stonkingly huge .
Translate that one . I bet they can &apos;t .
So Heather &apos;s going to like me .
Mark Bittman : What &apos;s wrong with what we eat
I write about food . I write about cooking .
Now , that is only a little bit hyperbolic .
And why do I say it ?
There was the bomb , and there &apos;s now .
Then hear this , please .
There &apos;s more .
And that &apos;s the direct result of eating a Western diet .
Now global warming was unforeseen .
It &apos;s not the beta-carotene , it &apos;s the carrot .
The evidence is very clear that plants promote health .
This evidence is overwhelming at this point .
Not bad .
But back to animals and junk food .
What do they have in common ?
One : we don &apos;t need either of them for health .
Two : both have been marketed heavily , creating unnatural demand .
We &apos;re not born craving Whoppers or Skittles .
Now , let &apos;s imagine a parallel .
Incredible , isn &apos;t it ?
Yet they do that .
And they do this here . It &apos;s the same deal .
But industry lobbyists would never let that happen .
And guess what ?
Now , don &apos;t get me wrong .
That &apos;s our number . 10 billion .
That &apos;s just the United States .
Seriously .
They both get it wrong , though .
A hundred years ago , guess what ?
Every family had a cook , usually a mom .
And those moms bought and prepared food .
It was like your romantic vision of Europe .
Margarine didn &apos;t exist .
There were no restaurant chains .
Eating ethnic was unheard of unless you were ethnic .
And fancy food was entirely French .
You just ate .
You didn &apos;t claim to be anything .
There was no marketing . There were no national brands .
Vitamins had not been invented .
You ate food .
The cornflake hadn &apos;t been invented .
Goldfish swam .
And again , everyone ate local .
Oranges became common in New York .
The effects of this are well known . They are everywhere .
Thus arrived convenience .
Who needed it though ? Meat was everywhere .
But by then cattle were already raised unnaturally .
New drugs kept them healthy .
Well , they kept them alive .
Healthy was another story .
And chicken soon joined them on the throne .
Meat consumption increased five-fold .
And this took care of the situation resoundingly .
Not that they were any good , but they were there .
For dessert , store-bought ice cream or cookies .
It wasn &apos;t all bad .
We weren &apos;t all hippies , either .
Meanwhile , food production had become industrial . Industrial .
Many people became fat-phobic .
Others worshiped broccoli , as if it were God-like .
But mostly they didn &apos;t eat broccoli .
Similarly , let &apos;s look at a granola bar .
Think of the frozen chicken nugget .
All you do is nuke it . What could be better ?
And zapped horribly , pathetically .
Leading the way -- what &apos;s leading the way ?
So , now we clamor for organic food .
That &apos;s good .
Let me pose you a question .
I don &apos;t know .
Now here is where we all meet .
We need to start acting .
How much livestock do you need to produce this ?
But don &apos;t we need meat to be big and strong ?
Isn &apos;t meat eating essential to health ?
Some of us might think that would be a good thing .
Ann Cooper &apos;s right .
The USDA is not our ally here .
And that happens to be quite easy .
Less meat , less junk , more plants .
It &apos;s a simple formula : eat food .
Eat real food .
We &apos;ll reduce not only calories , but our carbon footprint .
We have to choose that path .
Thank you .
David Hanson : Robots that &quot; show emotion &quot;
There he &apos;s starting to walk .
This is at the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology .
I built the head . They built the body .
It also recognizes where you &apos;re looking , your head orientation .
Okay . So I &apos;m smiling .
Now I &apos;m frowning .
And this is really heavily backlit .
Okay , here we go .
Oh , it &apos;s so sad .
Okay , so you smile , frowning .
Machines are becoming devastatingly capable of things like killing . Right ?
Those machines have no place for empathy .
And there is billions of dollars being spent on that .
So , we &apos;re involving two things .
You start to believe that it &apos;s alive and aware .
which was the basis of the movie &quot; Bladerunner . &quot;
And we &apos;re getting this mass-manufactured .
Interfacing with the Internet , it gets smarter over the years .
As artificial intelligence evolves , so does his intelligence .
Thank you so much . That &apos;s incredible .
Gever Tulley : Life lessons through tinkering
We &apos;re not trying to teach anybody any specific thing .
It &apos;s a six-day immersive experience for the kids .
Nothing ever turns out as planned ... ever .
We start from doodles and sketches .
And sometimes we make real plans .
And sometimes we just start building .
Problems become puzzles and obstacles disappear .
Decoration of the unfinished project is a kind of conceptual incubation .
All materials are available for use .
And the things that they build amaze even themselves .
Three , two , one , go !
Gever Tulley : A rollercoaster built by seven-year-olds .
Yay !
GT : Thank you . It &apos;s been a great pleasure .
Marco Tempest : Augmented reality , techno-magic
So magic is a very introverted field .
That &apos;s true even amongst peers .
Now my own speciality is combining digital technology and magic .
Could we bring down the lights please ? Thank you .
So let &apos;s give this a try .
Terribly sorry . I forgot the floor .
Wake up .
Hey .
Come on .
Please .
Come on .
Ah , sorry about that .
Forgot this .
Give it another try .
Okay .
He figured out the system .
Uh oh .
All right . Let &apos;s try this .
Come on .
Hey .
You heard her , go ahead .
Bye-bye .
Jackson Browne : A song inspired by the ocean
Thank you .
Majora Carter : Greening the ghetto
We garnered much support along the way .
One out of four South Bronx children has asthma .
These impacts are coming everyone &apos;s way .
Good .
Yeah , I &apos;m a poor black child from the ghetto .
These things make me different from you .
So how did things get so different for us ?
My dad was not alone .
A national highway construction boom was added to our problems .
600,000 people were displaced .
Now , why is this story important ?
Are these factors taken into consideration when land-use policy is decided ?
What costs are associated with these decisions ? And who pays ?
Think bike shops , juice stands .
We secured 20 million dollars to build first-phase projects .
Even during rush hour , it goes virtually unused .
Green roofs are soil and living plants .
And they provide habitats for our little friends !
So -- -- so cool !
I like that , too .
It &apos;s better to ask for forgiveness than permission .
In the post-Katrina era , we have still more in common .
We are more than simply national symbols of urban blight .
But I &apos;ll tell you later if you want to know .
At present , that &apos;s not happening in New York City .
And we are operating with a comprehensive urban planning deficit .
Now let &apos;s get this straight . I am not anti-development .
So I don &apos;t have a problem with developers making money .
This is my version of globalization .
He looked at the demographics .
For his brilliant efforts , he was nearly impeached .
We have no excuse in this country . I &apos;m sorry .
But Bogota &apos;s example has the power to change that .
You , however , are blessed with the gift of influence .
Use your influence in support of comprehensive sustainable change everywhere .
Make it a part of your dinner and cocktail conversations .
Help me fight for environmental and economic justice .
Support investments with a triple-bottom-line return .
Oh good , glad I have a little more time !
His response was a grant program .
I was making him an offer .
What troubled me was that this top-down approach is still around .
Now , don &apos;t get me wrong , we need money .
I have come from so far to meet you like this .
Ciao bellos !
Kary Mullis : A next-gen cure for killer infections
And I was pulling a molecule out of this bag .
Actually our body doesn &apos;t hate these .
Our body loves these . It eats them .
And I said , why don &apos;t you use that ?
Our antibiotics are running out .
And I feel now like George Bush .
It &apos;s like &quot; mission accomplished . &quot;
And it &apos;s killing bacteria . It &apos;s eating them .
You can stick this to something called a DNA aptamer .
Why did they not die ?
So we did it . Okay ?
Mission accomplished !
Hans Rosling : Global population growth , box by box
This box contains one billion people .
And they lived away then .
And their aspiration was to buy a car .
This was the economic level at which Sweden was .
Just look how many .
The world population has doubled since I went to school .
And now their aspiration is not only to have a car .
So this is where they are today .
They are now buying cars .
So there they are .
This is the new world we have today in 2010 .
And what will happen in the future ?
Well , I &apos;m going to project into 2050 .
They will start flying .
And they will start to buy electric cars .
This is what we will find there .
So what about the poorest two billion ?
What about the poorest two billion here ?
Will they move on ?
Here &#91; among the poorest &#93; , population is growing .
Because we already have this &#91; growth &#93; in process .
Here I have on the screen my country bubbles .
Every bubble is a country . The size is population .
The colors show the continent .
That &apos;s India and this is China . Size is population .
The year is 1960 .
Look , Bangladesh catching up with India .
They are still up here .
And the population will double in one generation .
Child survival is the new green .
And will it happen ?
I &apos;m a very serious &quot; possibilist . &quot;
It can be done .
We can have a much more just world .
And look at the position of the old West .
This will not happen &#91; again &#93; .
But it &apos;s a very important role .
Do it well and get used to it .
Thank you very much .
Joe Sabia : The technology of storytelling
Ladies and gentlemen , gather around .
I would love to share with you a story .
It was venerable .
It was ubiquitous .
But it was a little bit boring .
His name was Lothar , Lothar Meggendorfer .
He grabbed his pen , he snatched his scissors .
For this delight and for this wonder , people rejoiced .
There seemed to be no cure for this Meggendorferitis .
One Taiwanese production studio would interpret American politics in 3D .
And this was a cause for celebration .
The art of storytelling has remained unchanged .
And for the most part , the stories are recycled .
Jeff Smith : Lessons in business ... from prison
For the most part , everyone was just trying to survive .
It &apos;s a lot harder than you might think .
And it &apos;s hard for a couple of reasons .
So how do you survive ?
Well , you learn to hustle , all kinds of hustles .
There &apos;s legal hustles .
You pay everything in stamps . Those are the currency .
You charge another inmate to clean his cell .
You want a cigarette in prison ? Three to five dollars .
You want a dirty magazine ?
Well , it can be as much as 1,000 dollars .
All they &apos;ll learn on the inside is new hustles .
Thank you .
Alex Laskey : How behavioral science can lower your energy bill
How many of you have checked your email today ?
Come on , raise your hands .
How many of you are checking it right now ?
And how about finances ? Anybody check that today ?
Credit card , investment account ?
How about this week ?
Now , how about your household energy use ?
Anybody check that today ?
This week ? Last week ?
A few energy geeks spread out across the room .
It &apos;s good to see you guys .
The woman in the photo with me is Harriet .
We met her on our first family vacation .
This is the story of how Harriet came to pay attention .
In fact , only 10 percent ends up as light .
Turn off your air conditioning , turn on your fans .
Another group got an environmental message .
Most people guessed that money-saving message would work best of all .
In fact , none of these messages worked .
They had zero impact on energy consumption .
And wouldn &apos;t you know it , they did .
So what does this tell us ?
In fact , it already is .
And it &apos;s working .
And we &apos;re not burning anything .
That &apos;s half our coal usage right there .
So what are we waiting for ?
Utilities are still rewarded when their customers waste energy .
They ought to be rewarded for helping their customers save it .
But this story is much more than about household energy use .
Take a look at the Prius .
Which brings us back to Harriet .
We met her on our first family vacation .
It was then that her eyes lit up .
Now I &apos;m here with a genuine expert .
Tell me . What should I do to save energy ? &quot;
There are many experts who can help answer Harriet &apos;s question .
My goal is to make sure we are all asking it .
Thank you .
Miwa Matreyek : Glorious visions in animation and performance
Miwa Matreyek !
Ami Klin : A new way to diagnose autism
We intuit other people &apos;s feelings .
We know the meaning of their actions even before they happen .
We are social to the core .
And for them , autism was devastating .
They had profound intellectual disabilities .
Extremely , extremely isolated .
These are survival skills .
They orient to the caregiver .
Well , they orient to the caregiver .
The caregiver seeks the baby .
It doesn &apos;t . It begins with the beginning of life .
You &apos;d do probably two things , wouldn &apos;t you ?
You would recoil . You would call the police .
We do so , remember , intuitively , effortlessly .
And this is not something that happens to humans only .
Now remember that we learn a great deal by sharing experiences .
There are those individuals who don &apos;t talk at all .
There are those individuals who talk too much .
There are millions of individuals with autism all around us .
The societal cost of this condition is huge .
It &apos;s not that that window closes . It doesn &apos;t .
But it diminishes considerably .
So I feel that we have a bio-ethical imperative .
So this is our view of autism .
Autism creates itself .
So how do we do that ?
We had to see the world through her eyes .
We can see moment by moment what children are engaging with .
You &apos;re watching a video .
What are the children with autism doing ?
They are focusing on the revolving door , opening and shutting .
It &apos;s something very different .
I thought at the time that this was an intractable condition .
No longer . We can do a great deal of things .
And the idea is not to cure autism .
That &apos;s not the idea .
And there are those individuals who have incredible artistic abilities .
We want them to be free of that .
Well thank you for listening to me .
Alan Siegel : Let &apos;s simplify legal jargon !
I &apos;ve been simplifying things for 30 years .
I come out of the advertising and design business .
This is a real thing .
And many people might need help in computation .
And what about terms like &quot; over the limit &quot; ?
Perhaps a stealth thing .
Define it in context . Tell people what it means .
Plain English is about changing the content .
It &apos;s a grid , it &apos;s a calendar .
Received very favorably by business .
And there is some good news to report today .
There are 200 million letters that go out .
All the parts of the document in red are not intelligible .
They have been tested in the laboratory .
And the IRS has introduced the program .
We see all this complexity .
So , how are we going to change the world ?
Make clarity , transparency and simplicity a national priority .
I thank you .
Rodney Brooks : Why we will rely on robots
That we &apos;re overestimating the technology in the short term .
So I &apos;m scared we won &apos;t have enough robots .
And they would look that up .
The librarians were afraid their jobs were going to disappear .
But that &apos;s not what happened in fact .
Same thing happened in offices .
Back in the old days , people used spreadsheets .
But here was an interesting thing that came along .
So office workers became programmers of spreadsheets .
It increased their capabilities .
On the left there is the PackBot from iRobot .
So the robot takes over the dangerous jobs .
These are in hundreds of hospitals across the U.S.
And they take the dirty sheets down to the laundry .
They take the dirty dishes back to the kitchen .
They bring the medicines up from the pharmacy .
And ordinary people can &apos;t interact with them .
It &apos;s displaced the worker from the technology .
So Baxter is up here .
This is Chris Harbert from Rethink Robotics .
We &apos;ve got a conveyor there .
And then it &apos;ll go back , reach for another object .
The interesting thing is Baxter has some basic common sense .
By the way , what &apos;s going on with the eyes ?
The eyes are on the screen there .
The eyes look ahead where the robot &apos;s going to move .
And Baxter &apos;s safe to interact with .
But with Baxter it doesn &apos;t hurt .
It puts a little icon there .
That puts the green icon there .
He didn &apos;t have to select that from a menu .
These robots we &apos;re shipping every day .
They go to factories around the country .
This is Mildred .
Mildred &apos;s a factory worker in Connecticut .
She &apos;s worked on the line for over 20 years .
She decided she really liked robots .
Now she &apos;s got the robot doing it .
They &apos;re older , and they &apos;re getting older and older .
There aren &apos;t many young people coming into factory work .
There &apos;s two great forces that are both volitional but inevitable .
That &apos;s climate change and demographics .
Demographics is really going to change our world .
This is the percentage of adults who are working age .
And it &apos;s gone down slightly over the last 40 years .
The percentage of adults who are working age drops dramatically .
That &apos;s happening statistically right now .
And I don &apos;t mean robots in terms of companions .
Thanks very much .
Marco Tempest : A magical tale
Today &apos;s its debut .
It &apos;s a demonstration of augmented reality .
And the visuals you &apos;re about to see are not prerecorded .
They are live and reacting to me in real time .
So fingers crossed .
And keep your eyes on the big screen .
Magic is deception , but it is a deception we enjoy .
Without it , a script is just words .
Augmented reality is just the latest technology .
And sleight of hand is just an artful demonstration of dexterity .
We are all very good at suspending our disbelief .
Without this ability there is no magic .
Jean Robert-Houdin : A conjurer is not a juggler .
He is an actor playing the part of a magician .
The tricks of magic follow the archetypes of narrative fiction .
Now many of them are intensely dramatic .
Because the best stories always have a happy ending .
The tricks of magic have one special element .
They are stories with a twist .
He said that magicians deliberately exploit the way their audiences think .
MT : In that respect , magic tricks are like jokes .
Jokes lead us down a path to an expected destination .
The same thing happens when people watch magic tricks .
It &apos;s fun to be fooled .
We feel compelled to tell them .
They want to share the experience .
It keeps me busy .
We think in narrative structures .
It &apos;s a uniquely human achievement .
We turn facts into similes and metaphors , and even fantasies .
They give us our identity and a sense of community .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Hi .
I did that for two reasons .
I &apos;m used to a stationary mic .
It &apos;s the sensible shoe of public address .
I just become skanky .
So I &apos;m sorry about that .
And I &apos;m already off-message .
You cannot turn them off with a switch .
Soon , it had occurred to me what my job was .
Because that is what Knopf is .
We bring stories to the public .
They all need a face .
But you don &apos;t do this . &quot;
Because this is treating your audience like a moron .
And they deserve better .
So there you are .
Pure content and pure form , side by side .
No fighting , ladies .
Now , what is the story here ?
Someone is re-engineering dinosaurs by extracting their DNA from prehistoric amber .
Genius !
We &apos;re in the middle of the process .
And then I just threw some typography on it .
Very basic stuff , slightly suggestive of public park signage .
And even back then , Michael was on the cutting edge .
I miss Michael .
Well , they used it .
And I was thrilled .
No , that is not me .
I was so wasted . &quot;
That &apos;s a responsibility .
And it &apos;s a responsibility that I don &apos;t take lightly .
You get something that goes much deeper than that .
Hello !
What does that mean ?
Very simple stuff .
This is going to be the opposite of that .
The answer was the most low-tech thing you can imagine .
Now , that &apos;s a good printing job .
A book cover is a distillation .
This story was a real puzzle .
This is what it &apos;s about .
And so , here &apos;s the design , right ?
Huhh ! They &apos;ve been discovered by the sultan .
He will not be pleased .
Huhh ! And now the sultan is in danger .
Try experiencing that on a Kindle .
Don &apos;t get me started .
Seriously .
He &apos;d smell it .
So how do we show this ?
So this is on a semi-transparent piece of velum .
It &apos;s one part of the form and content .
And the object itself invited exploration interaction , consideration and touch .
Not exactly Jackie Collins .
So that &apos;s my story . To be continued .
What does it look like ?
Thank you .
And it is .
And yet , it feels natural to us now .
At the time , we knew that it was political .
But her suffering is equal to mine .
Aicha el-Wafi : Good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen .
I am the mother of Zacarias Moussaoui .
So they introduced me to five families .
And I saw Phyllis , and I watched her .
She was the only mother in the group .
The others were brothers , sisters .
I suffered a lot as a mother .
I was married when I was 14 .
So the story with Zacarias was too much really .
I know she really cried for her son .
But she knows where he is .
My son , I don &apos;t know where he is .
I don &apos;t know what happened to him .
We must be hand-in-hand and do something together .
I talk against violence , against terrorism .
This is why I &apos;m here in front of you .
But we were all so nervous .
&quot; Why does she want to meet us ? &quot;
And then she was nervous .
&quot; Why did we want to meet her ? &quot;
What did we want from each other ?
Because our time is up .
You must be tolerant .
You have to fight against violence .
This is what I wanted to say .
Graham Hill : Why I &apos;m a weekday vegetarian
I also knew that I &apos;m not alone .
So why was I stalling ?
Imagine your last hamburger .
Sound familiar ?
So I wondered , might there be a third solution ?
It &apos;s called weekday veg .
On the weekend , your choice .
Simple .
The program has been great , weekday veg .
Thank you .
Taryn Simon : Photographs of secret sites
Photography threatens fantasy .
And the outsider can never really reach the core .
In this context I &apos;ll just show you a few .
So I create these two poles .
Every image is accompanied with a very detailed factual text .
This is a 21-year-old Palestinian woman undergoing hymenoplasty .
This process costs 60,000 dollars .
There is a pig &apos;s head and African cane rats .
I do take certain liberties and intervene .
It &apos;s a research crop marijuana grow room .
This is a Braille edition of Playboy magazine .
And Playboy is always in the top few .
And the film was shot on 72 millimeter , government-issue film .
And that red dot is a marking on the government-issue film .
Meaning white fur , ice blue eyes , a pink nose .
It &apos;s a very violent process that is little known .
Kenny was born . He actually made it to adulthood .
This is the Death Star .
And it &apos;s shown here in its true orientation .
They flip the negative .
This is at Fort Campbell in Kentucky .
It &apos;s a Military Operations on Urbanized Terrain site .
It &apos;s called the World Church of God .
It &apos;s supposed to be a generic site of worship .
And I put them into my photograph .
It runs 24 hours a day , commercial free .
It &apos;s titled &quot; The Innocents . &quot;
I &apos;ll give you an example from a case .
And he served 10 years of a life sentence .
He served 18 years of a death sentence .
Calvin Washington was convicted of capital murder .
He is photographed at his alibi location .
I photographed him at the scene of arrest in Chicago .
William Gregory was convicted of rape and burglary .
He served seven years of a 70 year sentence in Kentucky .
He had been misidentified by an 11-year-old victim .
Now I &apos;m going to leave you with a self portrait .
That &apos;s it . Thank you .
Ed Boyden : A light switch for neurons
Think about your day for a second .
Let &apos;s make it concrete .
It &apos;s called the basket cell .
New ones are being discovered everyday .
They &apos;re excitatory .
Every one of these cells is an incredible electrical device .
Could we dial-in information precisely where we want it to go ?
Now how are we going to do that ?
So how do we do this ?
So these molecules are called channelrhodopsins .
So this turned out to be very simple to do .
You take this DNA and you put it into a neuron .
So this is very powerful .
This field has now come to be known as optogenetics .
The brain will do more of whatever got that reward .
And so that &apos;s what happens .
And he &apos;ll do that hundreds and hundreds of times .
Now we can generalize the idea .
Or that could be good clinical targets for treating brain disorders .
This goes back to the Pavlovian days .
This tone used to mean bad news .
And now this next clip is just eight minutes later .
Okay , there it goes . Right now .
If we could do that , this could be extremely powerful .
I already told you that electrical stimulators are not uncommon .
Seventy-five thousand people have Parkinson &apos;s deep-brain stimulators implanted .
And the retina , of course , is a complex structure .
Now how could you repair this ?
The eye is still transparent and you can get light in .
So this is some work that we &apos;re doing .
So he &apos;s not using vision to do it .
So how are we going to solve this ?
Light is converted to electricity on them .
Thank you .
Ed Boyden : That &apos;s right .
Right , yeah .
Ueli Gegenschatz : Extreme wingsuit flying
I started with paragliding .
Also different aerobatic maneuvers are possible with a paraglider .
From there I started with skydiving .
From regular , relative skydiving I went on to freeflying .
Freeflying is more the three-dimensional skydiving .
The one with the yellow-green suit , he &apos;s flying head-down .
From freeflying I went on to skysurfing .
Skysurfing is skydiving with a board on the feet .
From there I went on to wingsuit flying .
This is a jump I did in Rio de Janeiro .
You can see the Copacabana on the left-hand side .
of being in free fall , with all the visual references .
In 2008 I jumped the Eiffel Tower in Paris .
Or this jump , from a moving truck on the highway .
You need to have the best possible equipment .
Enjoy , and thank you very much .
I have some questions .
I think we all might have some questions .
Because it looks like it might .
It &apos;s not possible to land a wingsuit yet .
And I believe soon .
UE : Nope . It &apos;s just smoke .
Coming off of you ?
UE : Hopefully not .
That seems dangerous .
What do you do to to cover your face ?
Are you in a helmet ? Are you in goggles ?
And is that how you usually fly ?
So you have to be prepared .
Right . Now is there anything you don &apos;t do ?
UE : Thank you very much .
Amanda Palmer : The art of asking
So I didn &apos;t always make my living from music .
Hello .
And I would get harassed sometimes .
People would yell at me from their passing cars .
&quot; Get a job ! &quot;
It was consistent .
This was me on piano , a genius drummer .
This is a library in Auckland .
And I lay there thinking , these people have so little .
Is this fair ?
And I thought , this is fair .
This is this .
I &apos;ve always been with my band or my crew .
Is this what stupid people do ?
Is this how stupid people die ?
So I couchsurf a lot . I also crowdsurf a lot .
I maintain couchsurfing and crowdsurfing are basically the same thing .
And meanwhile , my band is becoming bigger and bigger .
We signed with a major label .
And our music is a cross between punk and cabaret .
It &apos;s not for everybody .
Well , maybe it &apos;s for you .
And they walk off .
I just want you to have this money . &quot;
And this starts happening all the time .
Thank you .
And the goal was 100,000 dollars .
And you can see how many people it is .
It &apos;s about 25,000 people .
How did you make all these people pay for music ? &quot;
It &apos;s kind of counterintuitive for a lot of artists .
They don &apos;t want to ask for things .
And a lot of artists have a problem with this .
Asking makes you vulnerable .
And this hurt in a really familiar way .
So this is slightly not safe for work .
This is my Kickstarter backer party in Berlin .
Should I ? Show me .
I see them as trust .
Thank you .
They &apos;ve changed the world .
And this here is the infamous NSA data center in Utah .
And it &apos;s a pretty big building .
Maybe it &apos;s better to imagine it as a comparison .
This is five times larger .
How many hard drives can you fit in an IKEA store ?
Right ? It &apos;s pretty big .
In fact , 96 percent of the planet are foreigners .
Right ?
They &apos;re about doing surveillance on people they know are innocent .
Now we know for a fact it &apos;s happening .
We didn &apos;t know about DoubleArrow .
But now we do .
So that &apos;s basically perfectly safe , uncrackable .
Backdooring encryption algorithms just boggles the mind .
But of course , these intelligence agencies are doing their job .
So what do we actually know about the leaks ?
Everything is based on the files leaked by Mr. Snowden .
And every single one of these companies denies .
Yet we have these files .
Instead , they &apos;ve been hacked .
And there &apos;s more evidence supporting this theory as well .
What the hell ?
All countries spy .
And maybe that &apos;s true .
Let &apos;s take , for example , Sweden .
And then we turn it around .
How many American leaders use Swedish webmails and cloud services ?
And the answer is zero .
So this is not balanced .
It &apos;s not balanced by any means , not even close .
Like , Skype used to be secure .
It used to be end-to-end encrypted .
Then it was sold to the United States .
Today , it no longer is secure .
It &apos;s the war on terror .
You shouldn &apos;t worry about it .
Well , it &apos;s not the war on terror .
It &apos;s not the war on terror .
Feel free to survey me if that helps .
And I have nothing to hide .
I &apos;m not doing anything bad or anything illegal .
Privacy is nonnegotiable .
It should be built in to all the systems we use .
And surveillance changes history .
We know this through examples of corrupt presidents like Nixon .
She was one of the targets of NSA surveillance .
That &apos;s what it &apos;s about .
Privacy is the building block of our democracies .
So Mr. Snowden , he &apos;s been blamed for many things .
So , what is there to be done ?
Should we worry . No , we shouldn &apos;t worry .
But that &apos;s not going to really change the situation .
And that &apos;s much easier said than done .
How do you do that ?
But maybe you don &apos;t have to do it alone .
Maybe you can do it together with other countries .
The solution is open source .
It only has to solve one little problem .
Thank you very much .
Charlie Todd : The shared experience of absurdity
Now this took place in January of 2002 .
And this woman is the star of the video .
She doesn &apos;t know she &apos;s being filmed .
She &apos;s being filmed with a hidden camera .
This is on the 6 train in New York City .
And this is the first stop along the line .
And that &apos;s me right there in a brown coat .
It &apos;s about 30 degrees outside .
I &apos;m wearing a hat . I &apos;m wearing a scarf .
And the girl &apos;s going to notice me right here .
One person &apos;s not that unusual .
They &apos;re going to be entering this car one by one .
We &apos;ll act as though we don &apos;t know each other .
And watch her make eye contact with them right about now .
So the video won &apos;t show everything .
This goes on for another four stops .
A total of seven guys enter anonymously in their underwear .
Thank you .
So that &apos;s a still from the video there .
And I love that girl &apos;s reaction so much .
And we &apos;ve continued to do it every year .
So I could do more large-scale projects .
So I got inspired by that .
This was completely unauthorized .
We didn &apos;t let the stores know we were coming .
And I stood in the park giving signals .
The second signal was for everybody to do Jumping jacks together .
You &apos;ll see that start right here .
And then we had dancing . We had everyone dance .
There were several other activities .
There &apos;s a better photo of it .
So here &apos;s the video .
So again , this is 2005 .
This is the Best Buy in New York City .
There was an eight year-old girl , a 10 year-old girl .
There was also a 65 year-old man who participated .
So a very diverse group of people .
But also , don &apos;t shop .
Just stand around and don &apos;t face products . &quot;
Everybody else is one of our actors .
The lower level employees thought it was very funny .
You can see them in this footage .
They &apos;re wearing either a yellow shirt or a black shirt .
And you can see the cops in this footage right here .
Thank you .
And one morning , I was riding the subway .
It &apos;s morning rush hour .
It &apos;s very cold outside .
Thank you .
And of course they don &apos;t .
You know , as kids , we &apos;re taught to play .
And we &apos;re never given a reason why we should play .
It &apos;s just acceptable that play is a good thing .
We don &apos;t need a reason .
Thank you very much .
Edi Rama : Take back your city with paint
In my previous life , I was an artist .
I still paint . I love art .
We faced many challenges .
But this use of colors was not just an artistic act .
He screeched that he would block the financing .
&quot; But why ? &quot; I asked him .
So it &apos;s time for change .
What are colors doing to us ? &quot;
Thirty-seven said no , we don &apos;t like it .
So we noticed change .
They had thrown the old shutter in the garbage collection place .
&quot; Come on , man ! What policemen ?
And this was not a misplaced feeling .
Crime did fall .
We removed 123,000 tons of concrete only from the riverbanks .
We planted 55,000 trees and bushes in the streets .
It &apos;s not about genes .
It &apos;s about system , it &apos;s about organization .
It &apos;s also about environment and respect .
We removed the kiosks .
We put the citizen first , and not the clerks .
I tweet . I love it .
Politics is not just about leaders .
It &apos;s not just about politicians and laws .
Our world is defined by the pace of change .
We can all change the world .
Efharisto and kalinihta .
Dan Meyer : Math class needs a makeover
I teach high school math .
I mean , it &apos;s just a losing proposition .
One is computation ; this is the stuff you &apos;ve forgotten .
For example , factoring quadratics with leading coefficients greater than one .
all but ensures they won &apos;t retain it .
Students lack perseverance .
This is really destructive .
He called it , &quot; an impatience with irresolution . &quot;
You &apos;re impatient with things that don &apos;t resolve quickly .
It applies equally to math .
I believe in real life .
Here &apos;s a really cool problem . I like this .
It &apos;s about defining steepness and slope using a ski lift .
I &apos;ll define them here : You have the visual .
So I hope you can see .
That &apos;s all we &apos;re doing here .
It &apos;s been obvious in my practice , to me .
And here &apos;s how it works .
I like this question . It &apos;s about a water tank .
First things first , we eliminate all the substeps .
Students have to develop those , they have to formulate those .
None of it &apos;s a distractor , so we lose that .
Such an underrepresented question in math curriculum .
So now we have a water tank .
So now we have the real deal .
How long will it take it to fill it up ?
And it &apos;s filling up slowly , agonizingly slowly .
It &apos;s tedious .
And then we follow the process I &apos;ve described .
We , instead , just watch the end of the movie .
This has been a lot of fun .
Math makes sense of the world .
Math is the vocabulary for your own intuition .
We need more patient problem solvers . Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Mariana Mazzucato : Government -- investor , risk-taker , innovator
Usually when I say this , someone says , &quot; Spotify !
That &apos;s Europe . &quot; But , yeah .
They are more dynamic .
This monster with big tentacles .
They &apos;re very explicit in these editorials .
Fund the infrastructure . Fund the schools .
Leave the rest to the revolutionaries . &quot;
Those colorful , out-of-the-box kind of thinkers .
GPS was funded by the military &apos;s Navstar program .
Even Siri was actually funded by DARPA .
They do . They spend on the marketing part .
They spend on the D part of R &amp; amp ; D.
It was actually shaping and creating markets .
It was even , God forbid , being a venture capitalist .
They want their returns in three to five years .
Who &apos;s actually funding the hard stuff ?
Of course , it &apos;s not just the state .
The private sector does a lot .
And so there &apos;s huge implications of this .
It &apos;s actually been the one thinking out of the box .
That whole juxtaposition thing , it &apos;s kind of there .
Well , there &apos;s a self-fulfilling prophecy .
You will fail when you innovative .
One out of 10 experiments has any success .
The Internet was crazy .
Well , unfortunately , that &apos;s not true .
Let the jobs go where they have to go , perhaps .
I mean , one can take a position on that .
It could happen perhaps through equity .
Thank you .
Jennifer 8 . Lee : The hunt for General Tso
What is this ?
Should I try it ?
Try it !
What is it called ?
Fortune cookie .
There &apos;s a piece of paper inside !
What is this ?
You &apos;ve won a prize !
What is this ?
It &apos;s a fortune !
Tasty !
So , where are they from ?
The short answer is , actually , they &apos;re from Japan .
So , how did they get to the United States ?
They are more American than anything else .
I love this dish .
He &apos;s in Taiwan right now .
He &apos;s retired , deaf and plays a lot of Mahjong .
I went to his home town .
And I went looking for chicken .
Finally found a cow -- and did find chicken .
And then they &apos;re like , is this Chinese food ?
Because it doesn &apos;t look like Chinese food to them .
Now , who came up with the idea of chop suey ?
So it was an early exercise of intellectual property rights .
So , you see different varieties of Chinese food .
She &apos;s like , &quot; It &apos;s not ?
And even the Brits have their own version .
This is a dish called Magic Bowl that I discovered .
But you know what ?
Instead , they had 110 , and they were completely shocked .
It wasn &apos;t that .
Yeah . So , I went and started looking .
So , a good sort of contrast is Chicken McNuggets .
And this logo !
So . Thank you very much .
Dong Woo Jang : The art of bow-making
Why bows ?
I &apos;m not quite sure .
And I did not bring the tools here to Long Beach .
Airport security .
I also researched extensively on bows around the world .
The most effective bow for me would be like this .
And four : Horn used to store energy in compression .
Thanks to my ancestors for robbing me of my invention .
And let &apos;s see how this one works .
This is a bamboo bow , with 45-pound draw weights .
You need to console and communicate with the wood material .
The bow resembles me , and I resemble the bow .
Now , I am shooting a part of myself to you .
Did it strike you ?
Thank you .
Erin McKean : The joy of lexicography
How about this word ?
Here , I &apos;ll show it to you .
Lexicography : the practice of compiling dictionaries .
It &apos;s little discrete -- that &apos;s spelled D-I-S-C-R-E-T-E -- bits .
And those bits are words .
Right ? Nobody hugs their dictionaries .
For one thing , I just do not do uniforms .
Well , I blame the Queen .
Why do I blame the Queen ?
So , there &apos;s this guy , right ? Victorian era .
James Murray , first editor of the Oxford English Dictionary .
There &apos;d be virtually no learning curve .
Computers ! What about computers ?
The thing about computers is , I love computers .
They don &apos;t change the end result .
It &apos;s steampunk . What we have is an electric velocipede .
The design has not changed .
And OK , what about online dictionaries , right ?
Online dictionaries must be different .
This is my favorite word , by the way .
Very useful word . So , look at that .
Online dictionaries right now are paper thrown up on a screen .
So there &apos;s not very much going on here .
There &apos;s not a lot of clickiness .
Does everyone know the ham butt problem ?
Woman &apos;s making a ham for a big , family dinner .
We have a pan that &apos;s too small !
So , you can &apos;t get a smaller ham .
The English language is as big as it is .
Some of my best friends are books .
But the book is not the best shape for the dictionary .
Now they &apos;re going to think &quot; Oh , boy .
No . There will still be paper dictionaries .
And I think this is a problem .
Lexicography is really more about material science .
They &apos;re just the right tools for the job .
Being in the dictionary is an artificial distinction .
If you love a word , it becomes real .
You can ask for help !
That &apos;s 500,000 more words . So that &apos;s a lot .
There &apos;s a lot going on there .
The OED has 33 different numbered definitions for set .
Tiny , little word , 33 numbered definitions .
One of them is just labeled &quot; miscellaneous technical senses . &quot;
Do you know what that says to me ?
I mean , lexicography is not rocket science .
And we don &apos;t even know the shape of the language .
We &apos;re missing California from American English .
So again , lexicography is not rocket science .
It can &apos;t be that hard to find some words !
He &apos;s a director of an electroplating company .
He &apos;s found more than 140 comets .
But he found 140 comets without a telescope .
Now , y &apos;all know where I &apos;m going with this .
Where did it come from ? Who said it ?
What newspaper was it in ? What book ?
Because a word is like an archaeological artifact .
So a word without its source is like a cut flower .
It dies too fast .
They use it synecdochically .
We can put in all the meanings .
Doesn &apos;t everyone want more meaning in their lives ?
This is what dictionaries used to look like .
It wasn &apos;t really what people needed .
Thank you very much for your kind attention .
Angela Belcher : Using nature to grow batteries
I brought along with me an abalone shell .
Yet , it &apos;s 3,000 times tougher than its geological counterpart .
So that &apos;s the vision that I &apos;ve been thinking about .
I like to say my favorite biomaterial is my four year-old .
Before that , they were all soft , fluffy structures .
So nature already gives us really exquisite structures on the nanoscale .
So here are some examples : these are some natural shells .
There are natural biological materials .
These proteins are very negatively charged .
And so here &apos;s the periodic table .
And I absolutely love the periodic table .
And so I give this out to thousands of people .
And that &apos;s a hard sell to a graduate student .
&quot; I have this great project -- 50 million years . &quot;
And this is pretty easy biotechnology .
And you could basically do this a billion times .
We engineered a virus to pick up carbon nanotubes .
So one part of the virus grabs a carbon nanotube .
And then it wires itself to the current collector .
I brought it here .
You can make lots of amplifications to it .
We &apos;re able to do this also with catalysis .
This is the example of photocatalytic splitting of water .
And I brought an example with me of that today .
My students promised me it would work .
These are virus-assembled nanowires .
In this case , you &apos;re seeing oxygen bubbles come out .
The last example are solar cells .
You can also do this with solar cells .
So this is a virus-based solar cell .
Thank you .
Stefan Sagmeister : Happiness by design
And at the time I was very superstitious .
But I actually walked away with a great job offer .
So there are , of course , two different possibilities .
This is 1983 .
And I remember it as a true moment of happiness .
While , somewhat , the Spaniards ...
And their inaugural exhibit was called &quot; Happiness . &quot;
And they interestingly sectioned the exhibit off into four different areas .
Under &quot; Nirvana &quot; they showed this Constable painting .
And there was a little -- an interesting theory about abstraction .
This is , you know , a book .
It &apos;s a happy David Byrne and an angry David Byrne .
You know , that &apos;s not a big deal to accomplish .
This is , you know , the movie poster .
True printed his own version of these signs .
So this is one .
Now , True is a real humanitarian .
Another New York project .
Opens up at dusk and dawn every day .
You don &apos;t see the horizon .
And the room is truly something to be seen .
People &apos;s demeanor changes when they go in there .
He &apos;s from Korea originally .
And other people go and fill them in .
You know , one is : just working without pressure .
Then : working concentrated , without being frazzled .
And being able to enjoy the end results .
And the whole thing just fell together .
Again , we could supply the content for it .
So I just picked another one .
And this was two weeks ago .
And then we did one more of these .
This is , again , for a magazine , dividing pages .
This is from the front .
Then it &apos;s : &quot; always works out . &quot;
Then it &apos;s &quot; for , &quot; with the light on .
And it &apos;s &quot; me . &quot;
Thank you so much .
Stephen Hawking &apos;s zero g flight
And I want to tell you that story .
I first met him through the Archon X PRIZE for Genomics .
Craig Venter chairs that event .
Come back down , you weigh twice as much .
You do it again and again .
We set out to do this .
It took us 11 years to become operational .
And we announced that we were going to fly Stephen Hawking .
And he wanted to go .
We worked hard to get all the permissions .
And what he said , for me , was very moving .
I therefore want to encourage public interest in space . &quot;
A few TEDsters here .
We set up a whole ER .
So we did a second parabola .
And a third .
And a seventh and an eighth .
And this man does not look like a 65-year-old wheelchair-bound man .
He was so happy .
Please join us in this epic adventure .
Thank you so much .
Matt Killingsworth : Want to be happier ? Stay in the moment
It &apos;s that we expect them to bring us happiness .
Maybe he &apos;s worried that he &apos;s going bald .
Any of those yes responses are what we called mind-wandering .
So what did we find ?
It &apos;s amazing .
Well , how often do people &apos;s minds wander ?
How does that depend on what people are doing ?
It pervades basically everything that we do .
Thank you .
Eli Beer : The fastest ambulance ? A motorcycle
This is an ambucycle .
This is the fastest way to reach any medical emergency .
It has everything an ambulance has except for a bed .
You see the defibrillator . You see the equipment .
We all saw the tragedy that happened in Boston .
I grew up in a small neighborhood in Jerusalem .
We were passing by a bus stop .
We saw a bus blow up in front of our eyes .
He just needed someone helping him .
We were so scared and we just ran away .
For two years , I volunteered on an ambulance in Jerusalem .
The traffic is so bad . The distance , and everything .
We never got there when somebody really needed us .
That second he declared this child dead .
He could have run from a block away .
He could have saved this child .
I said to myself , there must be a better way .
Just alert us by beeper .
We &apos;re not really interested in these kinds of new adventures .
&quot; I don &apos;t need your help , &quot; he said .
I was a very stubborn kid .
I ran there by foot . I had no medical equipment .
He was on Coumadin .
He was bleeding from his neck .
So today , 22 years later , we have United Hatzalah .
I forgot I &apos;m not in Israel .
We &apos;re not there to replace ambulances .
And we save people that otherwise would not be saved .
The second reason is because of our technology .
You know , Israelis are good in technology .
And the third thing are these ambucycles .
These ambucycles are an ambulance on two wheels .
They never , literally , get stuck in traffic .
That &apos;s why we get there so fast .
Muhammad Asli and Murad Alyan .
We started hand in hand saving Jews and Arabs .
Arabs were saving Jews . Jews were saving Arabs .
Something special happened .
Settlers were saving Arabs and Arabs were saving settlers .
And these are all volunteers .
No one is getting money .
They &apos;re all doing it for the purpose of saving lives .
And he saved my father .
Could you imagine how I felt in that moment ?
When I started this organization , I was 17 years old .
I never even knew what TEDMED was then .
But it could spread everywhere .
It &apos;s very easy to adopt .
Last year alone , we treated in Israel 207,000 people .
Forty-two thousand of them were life-threatening situations .
And we made a difference .
We all want to be heroes .
Thank you very much .
Joshua Silver : Adjustable liquid-filled eyeglasses
I &apos;d like to start with a little experiment .
They also have an estimate of around a billion .
Glasses are not very expensive . They &apos;re quite plentiful .
There are just way too few eye care professionals .
This is the ratio of optometrists to people in sub-Saharan Africa .
Next step in my process .
So , I &apos;ve now made eye glasses to my prescription .
Okay , so I &apos;ve made these glasses and ...
Okay , I &apos;ve made the glasses to my prescription and ...
... I &apos;ve just ...
And I &apos;ve now made some glasses . That &apos;s it .
Now , these aren &apos;t the only pair in the world .
In fact , this technology &apos;s been evolving .
There are about 30,000 in use now .
I have a global vision for vision .
But the cost has to be brought right down .
How do you solve this problem ?
You start to get into detail .
How do you deal with the industry ?
And the answer to that is research .
Julia Bacha : Pay attention to nonviolence
I &apos;m a filmmaker .
Why aren &apos;t Palestinians using nonviolent resistance ?
Yet , most of you have probably never heard about them .
Palestinian We were told the wall would separate Palestine from Israel .
Today you &apos;re invited to a peaceful march .
You are joined by dozens of your Israeli brothers and sisters .
Israeli Activist : Nothing scares the army more than nonviolent opposition .
But I think the girls could do it .
Chanting : One united nation .
Fatah , Hamas and the Popular Front !
News Anchor : The clashes over the fence continue .
Reporter : Israeli border police were sent to disperse the crowd .
They were allowed to use any force necessary .
These are live bullets .
It &apos;s like Fallujah . Shooting everywhere .
But there were others around me who weren &apos;t even cowering .
Protester : This is a peaceful march .
There is no need to use violence .
Chanting : We can do it ! We can do it !
We can do it !
Yet the media remains mostly silent on these stories .
But that &apos;s true for adults too .
So we organized a screening .
So they kept on going .
These leaders have proven that nonviolence works in places like Budrus .
Thank you .
Seth Godin : How to get your ideas to spread
Like the greatest invention since ... the telegraph or something .
I call it the &quot; TV-industrial complex . &quot;
You use the distribution you get to sell more products .
You take the profit from that to buy more ads .
Right . Articles about water , ads about water .
Now there are magazines about water .
New products from Coke Japan -- water salad .
Cows are invisible . Cows are boring .
I could do that again if you want it .
And that is the essence of where idea diffusion is going .
Every week the number one best-selling DVD in America changes .
Because it &apos;s new , because it &apos;s fresh .
And when Lionel started his bakery the French pooh-pooh-ed it .
It wasn &apos;t what they expected .
That &apos;s what mass marketing is .
It was all about going for the center .
But market to these people because they care .
These are the people who are obsessed with something .
It &apos;ll spread to the entire curve .
Krispy Kreme has figured this whole thing out .
Not everybody wants it but they don &apos;t care .
These guys make the loudest car stereo in the world .
Pearl Jam , 96 albums released in the last two years .
Every one made a profit . How ?
They only sell them on their website .
This hospital crib cost 10,000 dollars , 10 times the standard .
But hospitals are buying it faster than any other model .
And one person at a time , the idea spreads .
These are not diamonds , not really .
They &apos;re made from &quot; cremains . &quot;
Oh , you like my ring ? It &apos;s my grandmother .
Fastest-growing business in the whole mortuary industry .
A couple of quick rules to wrap up .
Proctor and Gamble knows this , right ?
Very good is boring . Very good is average .
So my three stories .
Sales tripled . Why ?
Because he did something that was at the fringes .
People with 20,000-dollar stereos don &apos;t like new music .
The last example I want to give you .
This is a map of Soap Lake , Washington .
But they do have a lake .
That &apos;s a purple cow ; that &apos;s something worth noticing .
Thank you very much for your attention .
Rob Hopkins : Transition to a world without oil
Other stories are that everything is on the verge of unraveling .
But I want to tell you a different story here today .
Like all stories , it has a beginning .
If you could help me with that it would be fantastic .
This is a liter of oil .
It gives us an energy return that &apos;s unimaginable , historically .
And that gap continues to widen .
Completely unprecedented , historically .
Already that &apos;s fallen to about 11 .
There are 98 oil-producing nations in the world .
But of those , 65 have already passed their peak .
We have no choice other than deep and urgent decarbonization .
Otherwise you &apos;d flood your entire town with warm porridge .
It &apos;s something that was unimaginable to people then .
And we have the elves in the form of China .
This is a popular story in some places .
But the world isn &apos;t Second Life .
We can be astonishingly inventive and creative .
Energy and technology are not the same thing .
What I &apos;m involved with is the transition response .
It &apos;s something which has spread incredibly fast .
And it is something which has several characteristics .
It &apos;s sensitive to place and to scale .
Transitional is completely different .
It learns very much from its mistakes .
And it &apos;s a process which is really joyful .
The idea of resilience comes from the study of ecology .
So how does this transition idea work ?
They pick up some of the tools that we &apos;ve developed .
They show films , they give talks , and so on .
It &apos;s a process which is playful and creative and informative .
There are now over 200 formal transition projects .
They are mulling whether they &apos;re going to take it further .
We need international legislation from Copenhagen and so on .
We need national responses . We need local government responses .
A lot of places are working with their local schools .
Planting productive trees throughout urban spaces .
You take it anywhere else , it &apos;s not worth anything .
And that &apos;s certainly been my experience with transition .
And we see it all over the place as well now .
Because I think stories are vital here .
I &apos;ve been astonishingly lucky , we &apos;ve been astonishingly lucky .
Thank you very much .
&quot; People do stupid things .
That &apos;s what spreads HIV . &quot;
Well , one or two brave souls .
Wonderful .
It &apos;s getting blunter and blunter .
&quot; Oh yeah , by sharing needles . &quot;
&quot; Oh yeah . &quot; Hundred percent .
&quot; So are you carrying a needle ? &quot;
&quot; Are you carrying clean needles ? &quot;
One in four , maximum .
There &apos;s just kind of an ick factor there .
And that changes the equation slightly , doesn &apos;t it ?
So , suddenly it becomes perfectly rational to share needles .
This is a really easy problem .
For once , your incentives are aligned .
We &apos;ve got what &apos;s rational for public health .
So she was making a politically rational decision .
There is nothing on the other side .
So , completely irrational , you would think .
So it becomes quite rational to deny services to injectors .
Now let &apos;s talk about sex .
Are we any more rational about sex ?
It &apos;s not that easy !
Here , maybe you &apos;ll have better luck .
And that is reflected in the epidemic that we have today .
You can see these horrifying figures from Africa .
No one wants it .
This , for example , this gentleman is called Joseph .
He &apos;s from Haiti and he has AIDS .
Not for nothing do we call it the Lazarus Effect .
Let &apos;s just stop treating people . &quot;
Of course not , of course not .
We need to expand antiretroviral treatment as much as we can .
So these are data from Scotland .
Then it came way down .
This is of new infections .
What does that mean ?
What does it mean ?
Is that what &apos;s happening ?
No , and I call it the &quot; compassion conundrum . &quot;
Why does she do that job ?
It varies a bit province to province .
Okay , Ines .
Ines : So why is prevalence still rising ?
It &apos;s all politics .
When you get to politics , nothing makes sense .
The truth is that everyone has a different rationale .
But here &apos;s the thing : we are the voters .
Thank you .
Ellen Dunham-Jones : Retrofitting suburbia
So why is this important ?
Public health is another reason to consider retrofitting .
And then there &apos;s finally -- there &apos;s the affordability question .
I mean , that &apos;s 2005 figures .
But is it practical ?
I think it is .
They &apos;re the other big generation .
It no longer just makes sense .
That land is more valuable than just surface parking lots .
It turns out , all sorts of things .
It &apos;s keeping the lights on .
It &apos;s becoming , I think , a really great institution .
But some of them have been much more incremental .
So , you know , sometimes it &apos;s incremental .
Sometimes , it &apos;s all at once .
Transit is a big driver of retrofits .
So here &apos;s what it looks like .
This one is one of my favorites , Belmar .
This was a very large mall on a hundred-acre superblock .
Here was the mall in its heyday .
So here &apos;s the site in 1975 with the mall .
By 1995 , the mall has died .
The department stores are multistory ; they &apos;re better built .
They &apos;re easy to be re-adapted .
But the one story stuff ...
that &apos;s really history .
So here it is at projected build-out .
It &apos;s about two-thirds built out right now .
Here &apos;s what the new Main Street looks like .
You want to also try to get more systemic transformation .
We need to also retrofit the corridors themselves .
So this is one that has been retrofitted in California .
But densification is not going to work everywhere .
Sometimes re-greening is really the better answer .
This is another re-greening example .
It also makes sense in very strong markets .
The creek had been culverted under the parking lot .
What &apos;s next ?
I think we have three challenges for the future .
Where should we be redeveloping ?
And where should we be encouraging re-inhabitation ?
I have to say , these are very hybrid places .
They are new but trying to look old .
They have urban streetscapes , but suburban parking ratios .
But we &apos;ve got to get the architecture better .
The final challenge is for all of you .
Thank you .
Mitchell Besser : Mothers helping mothers fight HIV
I want you to take a trip with me .
and people are initially reluctant to tell you .
HIV isn &apos;t like other medical conditions ; it &apos;s stigmatizing .
This map depicts the global distribution of HIV .
We talk about things in relative terms .
The reality is really , very different .
It &apos;s an entire package of services , and it works .
What does that mean ?
And where do they come from ?
Well , less than one comes from the United States .
One , on average , comes from Europe .
100 come from Asia and the Pacific .
And let &apos;s look at another map .
That thin sliver you see here , that &apos;s Africa .
And it &apos;s the same with nurses .
It &apos;s not possible -- it doesn &apos;t work .
And so we need to find better ways of providing care .
Meds don &apos;t equal medical care .
And I want to change the story a little bit .
They &apos;re drinking tea , they &apos;re having sandwiches .
Have a seat . You &apos;re safe here .
We &apos;re all HIV-positive .
Your baby is going to be HIV-negative . &quot;
We view mothers as a community &apos;s single greatest resource .
So often the men are gone .
This is the medical care that goes beyond just medicines .
Now , doctors and nurses -- they too get trained .
Our mentor mothers get trained every single year and retrained .
Our organization has three goals .
The first , to prevent mother-to-child transmission .
So how do we do it ?
Men are not frequently part of pregnancy care .
And this is so important in breaking through the stigma .
Disclosure is so central to prevention .
We also work in groups .
The hardest barrier really is around stigma reduction .
And it &apos;s important about disclosure .
And so the mentor mother went along with .
And everybody was quiet .
I &apos;m HIV-positive .
I &apos;ve been afraid to tell everybody . &quot;
And you see where this is going .
I thought you were going to hate me . &quot;
I am proof that there is hope .
And it is a crisis in health care systems .
So we talk in terms of what we call task-shifting .
How do you build a better health care system ?
And our organization helps women across that bridge .
Our organization works on three levels .
The second , communities -- empowering women .
They become leaders within their communities .
We need to change attitudes to women in Africa .
We have to do that .
Our health care systems are broken .
What &apos;s extraordinary is how simple the premise is .
Mothers with HIV caring for mothers with HIV .
Past patients taking care of present patients .
And empowerment through employment -- reducing stigma .
Each person must know their HIV status .
Those who are HIV-negative must know how to stay negative .
MB : Simple solutions to complex problems .
Mothers caring for mothers .
It &apos;s transformational .
Thank you .
Jenna McCarthy : What you don &apos;t know about marriage
and not to have sex with anyone else , ever .
He buys a ring , she buys a dress .
They go shopping for all sorts of things .
She takes him to Arthur Murray for ballroom dancing lessons .
And the big day comes .
You know , because they can &apos;t hear the snoring anymore .
Of course , the other half won &apos;t , right ?
And researchers want to know why .
So what &apos;s going on when it doesn &apos;t ?
What are they doing right ?
What can we learn from them ?
Obvious , right .
For example , the happy wife .
These are couples who can find good in any situation .
Because we needed a study to tell us this .
But here &apos;s what &apos;s going on here .
Here &apos;s an interesting one .
This is an actual study , and let me clarify .
Oh no .
So what else can you do to safeguard your marriage ?
Do not win an Oscar for best actress .
I &apos;m serious .
They actually call it the Oscar curse .
Drinking alcohol , it seems , is bad for your marriage .
Yeah .
But here &apos;s a scary one : Divorce is contagious .
We &apos;re healthier , physically and emotionally .
We produce happier , more stable and more successful kids .
So I &apos;m obviously going to need fatten him up .
So we have to keep an eye on that .
And we do like a cocktail or two .
So I &apos;ve got all those things going for me .
I &apos;ll see you at the bar .
John Maeda : How art , technology and design inform creative leaders
Do you know about the parent-teacher conference ?
And he kind of nodded , you know ?
And that always stuck with me all my life .
As you remember , the Apple II did nothing at all .
It would say you &apos;re wrong most of the time .
That was the computer we knew .
It was called the Human Powered Computer Experiment .
It &apos;s a room broken in two halves .
And the floppy disk drive person wears it .
So starting from technology , technology is a wonderful thing .
And then after a few years , we got CD-quality sound .
And then movies , via CD-ROM . It was amazing .
Remember that excitement ?
You see this little pattern here ?
Well , content is the word up there : fear .
Or fear like this , kind of a nightclub typeface .
Like , we gotta go to Fear .
It &apos;s , like , amazing , right ?
It just changes the same content .
You feel for them .
Or you change the typeface to something like this .
I can never get in there .
Free bold feels like Mandela free .
It &apos;s like , yes , I can be free .
Design does that .
So -- yeah .
So I made a lot of work in the &apos; 90s .
This was a square that responds to sound .
It &apos;s called &quot; Tap , Type , Write . &quot;
It has 10 variations .
There &apos;s a shift .
This is , like , a ring of letters .
It &apos;s peaceful , like that .
Thank you .
Thank you .
And why do we have this facility ?
And the shopkeeper would say , &quot; It &apos;s old . &quot;
And he realized , it isn &apos;t about old or new .
It &apos;s about something in between .
We aren &apos;t functioning so easily anymore .
We aren &apos;t a simple authoritarian regime anymore .
And also &quot; no love . &quot;
So that is authoritarianism .
And what is that , structurally ?
It is now a network instead of a perfect tree .
Someone who &apos;s creative actually loves to learn from mistakes .
And it felt kind of like being president , actually .
How many coffees do you have ?
How often are you calling them , emailing them ?
So these kind of systems , I believe , are important .
They &apos;re targeted social media systems around leaders .
Emiliano Salinas : A civil response to violence
I was born in 1976 .
I grew up in a traditional Mexican family .
Don &apos;t worry .
I think we have a problem in Mexico .
We have a big problem .
I think there &apos;s consensus on this .
No one argues -- we all agree there &apos;s a problem .
Is it the Zetas ? The drug traffickers ? The government ?
Corruption ? Poverty ? Or is it something else ?
I think none of these is the problem .
I don &apos;t mean they don &apos;t deserve attention .
We are a country of victims .
We were victims of the Spaniards .
Then we were victims of the French .
Then we were victims of Don Porfirio .
Then we were victims of the PRI .
Even of Salinas .
And of El Peje .
Hold on ! Wait a minute !
What if none of these things is the problem ?
The problem is not the things we feel victims of .
The problem is that we play the role of victims .
We want to pretend that Mexico has the flu .
But it doesn &apos;t .
Mexico has cancer .
Many people in Mexico are afraid today .
We &apos;re very afraid .
And we &apos;re acting out of that fear .
Does that make streets more or less safe ?
Less safe !
We need to confront this fear .
For many people , acting involves courage .
We go from fear to courage .
They say , &quot; I can &apos;t take it anymore .
Let &apos;s do something about it . &quot;
Usually it &apos;s one or two a year .
Now we &apos;re experiencing one every week .
It means it &apos;s determined and effective , but not violent .
There are examples of this kind of action in Mexico .
So what did they do ?
We &apos;ll be waiting for you right here . &quot;
They stayed there .
Of course , criminals can respond .
And in this case , they did .
On July 7th , 2009 , Benjamín Le Barón was murdered .
But he keeps fighting .
He keeps organizing .
He keeps mobilizing .
These heroic acts are present all over the country .
And they &apos;re out there !
They just have to raise their hands .
That devotion we feel for the national football team .
A mother is the most sacred thing in life .
We are going through the darkest moment in our recent history .
What are we going to do ?
Masiosare , the strange enemy , is here .
Where is the soldier in each son ?
Today in Mexico we &apos;re asking for Gandhis .
We need Ghandis .
We &apos;re facing a very powerful opponent .
But we are many more .
They can take a man &apos;s life .
Anyone can kill me , or you , or you .
But no one can kill the spirit of true Mexicans .
Thank you .
Evelyn Glennie : How to truly listen
That &apos;s my only real aim in life .
So technically , I can actually read this .
I will do exactly as I &apos;m told .
There &apos;s nothing too difficult about the piece .
I &apos;m being told where to play on the drum .
I &apos;m being told which part of the stick to use .
And I &apos;m being told the dynamic .
Snares on , snares off .
Now my career may last a little longer !
Just the basic feeling .
However , that is simply not enough .
And I think what Herbie said -- please listen , listen .
We have to listen to ourselves , first of all .
By holding it tightly , I feel strangely more detached .
And I &apos;m doing far , far less .
Not just translate them , but interpret them .
that of a difference . Then gradually ... and gradually ...
They &apos;re all different .
Same amount of weight , but different sound colors .
And I just couldn &apos;t quite accept that .
No circumstances at all were used to refuse any entry .
I have the sound coming this way .
He would have the sound coming through the resonators .
If there were no resonators on here , we would have ...
Can you hear anything ?
Exactly . Because I &apos;m not even touching it .
But yet , we get the sensation of something happening .
Do you see what I mean ?
Whatever the eye sees , then there &apos;s always sound happening .
May be great there , but terrible up there .
And this is quite interesting .
In another year &apos;s time , three extra steps .
Those are hugely important aspects to think about .
I &apos;m assuming we &apos;ve all experienced thunder .
Audience : No .
Evelyn Glennie : Well then , stop clapping . Try again .
Try again . Snow .
See , you &apos;re awake .
Rain . Not bad . Not bad .
Now -- great imagination , thank you very much .
Maybe I can use my jewelry to create extra sounds .
So we never , ever dealt with actual study books .
And that &apos;s exactly what he did .
We had to study from study books .
You know . I need to say something .
&quot; Why am I practicing paradiddles ?
They &apos;re experiencing that rawness there .
But thank you very much for having me !
Adam Sadowsky : How to engineer a viral music video
Hi there .
Some of you may recognize this image .
This is the opening frame of the video that we created .
50-million-plus views on YouTube .
A fantastically viral and wonderful video .
So we were really excited about working with them .
They wanted the machine action to follow the song feeling .
They wanted us to make use of the space .
It included an exterior loading dock .
They wanted it messy , and we were happy to oblige .
The machine itself would start the music .
And the machine would maintain synchronization throughout .
Okay .
They wanted it to end precisely on time .
Okay .
The machine itself has 89 distinct interactions .
We destroyed two pianos and 10 televisions in the process .
We went to Home Depot well over a hundred times .
And it &apos;s actually in the machine .
So what did we learn from all of this ?
And we learned that small stuff stinks .
What else ? Planning is incredibly important .
And so while planning is important , so is flexibility .
Again , small to large is relevant here .
Life can be messy .
There were incredibly difficult moments in the building of this thing .
Months were spent in this tiny , cold warehouse .
Thank you very much .
OK Go : An introduction . Hello TEDxUSC .
We are OK Go .
It think we can do better than this . Hello TEDxUSC .
I mean , &quot; Curiosity &quot; -- excuse me .
Let me start again .
Tim &apos;s sundial hat .
Sorry , start again .
Dogs .
That one &apos;s pretty good . It &apos;s getting better .
James Hansen : Why I must speak out about climate change
And what would you do if you knew what I know ?
Let &apos;s start with how I got to this point .
Did it mean that Venus had an ionosphere ?
Or was Venus extremely hot ?
And it was kept hot by a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere .
Its changes will affect all of humanity .
I worked with other scientists to analyze Earth climate observations .
All of these impacts or are now well under way .
There will be stronger storms and greater flooding .
Most of the things mentioned in our 1981 paper were facts .
But energy policies continued to focus on finding more fossil fuels .
By then we had two grandchildren , Sophie and Connor .
But there were consequences .
So the key quantity is Earth &apos;s energy imbalance .
Is there more energy coming in than going out ?
If so , more warming is in the pipeline .
It will occur without adding any more greenhouse gasses .
That &apos;s how much extra energy Earth is gaining each day .
Yet , there was more energy coming in than going out .
Now consider Earth &apos;s climate history .
But that lag is exactly what is expected .
And more CO2 causes more warming .
The physics does not change .
There is evidence that feedbacks are already beginning .
Methane is also beginning to escape from the permafrost .
What sea level rise can we look forward to ?
Where you are sitting now would be under water .
Ice sheets would continue to disintegrate for centuries .
There would be no stable shoreline .
The economic consequences are almost unthinkable .
Hundreds of New Orleans-like devastations around the world .
Global warming is already affecting people .
More grandchildren helped me along .
Jake is a super-positive , enthusiastic boy .
Several top economists are coauthors on this proposition .
Does not enlarge government .
Leaves energy decisions to individual choices .
Sounds like a conservative climate plan . &quot;
A large fraction of species will be committed to extinction .
Imagine a giant asteroid on a direct collision course with Earth .
That is the equivalent of what we face now .
But we aren &apos;t even starting .
Clearly , I haven &apos;t gotten this message across .
The science is clear .
We owe it to our children and grandchildren .
Thank you .
Laura Snyder : The Philosophical Breakfast Club
An elderly , white-haired man stands up .
They &apos;re even more shocked by what he says .
&quot; You must stop calling yourselves natural philosophers . &quot;
The crowd grew angry and began to complain loudly .
What were scientists called before ?
These were brilliant , driven men who accomplished amazing things .
Richard Jones became an important economist who later influenced Karl Marx .
The members of the philosophical breakfast club disagreed .
The philosophical breakfast club changed that , working together .
The four men really helped each other in every way .
It had a separate memory and central processor .
So the philosophical breakfast club helped invent the modern scientist .
That &apos;s the heroic part of their story .
There &apos;s a flip side as well .
They did not foresee at least one consequence of their revolution .
Thank you .
Zach Kaplan + Keith Schacht : Toys and materials from the future
Zach Kaplan : Keith and I lead a research team .
For me , I really love this idea .
Do you have a need for speed ?
Aqua Rocket : coming this summer .
So I just want to quickly explain how this would work .
This is the magnetically-levitating board that they mentioned in the commercial .
Now this is important for two reasons .
Now , you see the magnet fell really slowly .
There &apos;re a few different versions of it .
Some of them automatically unroll like this one .
I &apos;d make my very own walking stick .
An olive server .
Some type of extension pole -- like what the painters use .
You sir , come on up .
Come on up . Tell everybody your name .
Steve Jurvetson : Steve .
Right there . That &apos;s great .
And hold onto this . Good luck to you .
No , not yet .
Little bit -- that &apos;s perfect , just perfect .
SJ : It &apos;s cold .
It &apos;s so safe you could drink this stuff .
All right , well thanks for coming up .
SJ : Excellent , thank you .
So what &apos;s the significance of this dry liquid ?
You can circulate it to draw the heat away .
While he was doing this , he noticed an unexpected thing .
We have a video to show you .
It &apos;s technically called , &quot; shape-retaining property . &quot;
Now , think about your interactions with aluminum foil .
This could totally change the way that you interface with paper .
Old Milk Carton : Oh yeah , it smells good .
Who are you ?
New Milk Carton : I &apos;m New Milk .
OMC : I used to smell like you .
Fresh Watch , from Inventables Dairy Farms .
Packaging that changes color when your milk &apos;s gone off .
Don &apos;t let milk spoil your morning .
And these dyes change color in response to odors .
This can radically improve the way that doctors diagnose patients .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Rose George : Let &apos;s talk crap . Seriously .
Let &apos;s talk dirty .
That &apos;s the other WTO .
2.5 billion people worldwide have no adequate toilet .
They don &apos;t have a bucket or a box .
Forty percent of the world with no adequate toilet .
Fifty communicable diseases like to travel in human shit .
It &apos;s the runs , the Hershey squirts , the squits .
Still not sure about the bikini .
And here &apos;s another image of diarrhea .
This is Marie Saylee , nine months old .
And that &apos;s her dad .
It &apos;s a very potent weapon of mass destruction .
These are cholera beds in Haiti .
But we know how to fix this .
It &apos;s a wonderful waste disposal device .
We don &apos;t have a neutral word for it .
Poop &apos;s not particularly adequate .
Shit offends people . Feces is too medical .
No one &apos;s going to refuse clean water .
So a toilet can put a girl back in school .
And I understand that . Who can blame them ?
That &apos;s not the only thing it can do for you .
Poop can cook your dinner .
It &apos;s got nutrients in it .
We ingest nutrients . We excrete nutrients as well .
We don &apos;t keep them all .
There is now a new career path called stool donor .
It &apos;s like the new sperm donor .
She &apos;s been suffering for years .
It &apos;s astonishing , but hardly anyone is still doing it .
Maybe it &apos;s the ick factor .
So the idea is to manipulate human emotion .
They tried selling soap as healthy . No one bought it .
They tried selling it as sexy . Everyone bought it .
It &apos;s called &quot; No Loo , No I Do . &quot;
She &apos;d grown up with a latrine .
It was no big deal , but it was a latrine .
She was scared of snakes . She was scared of rape .
After three days , she did an unthinkable thing .
She left .
But not just that .
Kids were dying of diarrhea and cholera .
That &apos;s what really made them change their behavior .
But there are things to worry about .
It &apos;s the most off-track Millennium Development Goal .
It &apos;s about 50 or so years off track .
They &apos;ve made it conversational .
People go out and upgrade their toilet .
They talk about it . They &apos;ve sanitized it .
Our sewers are crumbling .
Things are going wrong here too .
The solution to all of this is pretty easy .
Thank you .
Frank Gehry : My days as a young rebel
I &apos;m going to go right into the slides .
Let me go right into the slides .
Can you turn off the light ? Down .
I like to be in the dark .
This is in Venice .
And then I did a law school for Loyola in downtown L.A.
And we continue to work with this client .
They wanted a sense of place .
And the success of it threw me for a loop .
So , nobody would like this .
And after we failed , I just kept failing .
So , it was an accidental discovery .
I got into fish .
And so I started making these funny things .
I did this building in Japan .
And I love sake and Kobe and all that stuff .
And the client said , &quot; Why no fish ? &quot;
But he was right -- I couldn &apos;t do the tail .
It was pretty hard .
And I put them together , and you walk between them .
It was a dialog with the context again .
Couldn &apos;t find it .
So ...
This was built in six months .
We made the drawings of the fish and the scales .
I played with it in the evening .
And the next night , we had gefilte fish .
It was a joke .
I play with funny people like &#91; Claes &#93; Oldenburg .
We &apos;ve been friends for a long time .
And we &apos;ve started to work on things .
He was the Swiss Army knife .
P for Palladio .
The highlight of the performance was at the end .
And I can tell you -- it &apos;s totally an Oldenburg .
I had nothing to do with it .
We made it into a sailing craft .
People hate it .
And I &apos;m always drawn to that .
But Claes made homage to it in the Loyola Law School .
And that chain link is really expensive .
It &apos;s in perspective and everything .
And then we did a camp together for children with cancer .
And you can see , we started making a building together .
Of course , the milk can is his .
And he pushed that .
It made my building look sick .
It led to the building on the left .
I just tell the stories .
And it &apos;s just a complex of factory buildings .
It &apos;s copper and galvanize .
I spent a lot of time undoing Richard Meier &apos;s aesthetic .
And they end up looking like stone .
This is the central area .
There &apos;s a ramp .
Stanley was instrumental in my getting this job .
And so Stanley did the little dome thing .
And we did it over the phone and by fax .
He would send me a fax and show me something .
I don &apos;t want the tower . &quot;
And so I decided to put him in a depression .
And he put these two bridges with pink guardrails on it .
And so then I put this big billboard behind it .
And I call it , &quot; David and Goliath . &quot;
And that &apos;s my cafeteria .
In Boston , we had that old building on the left .
Instead of , like , copper in 10 or 15 .
I flew in one night and took this picture .
And the shape fit perfectly .
I just joined the points .
In the curved part there &apos;s all the mechanical equipment .
This is a small house somewhere .
It &apos;s in the West Valley .
These are the models .
It &apos;s kind of like a whole built town .
I thought it was fitting for me to be doing that .
He was too busy .
He didn &apos;t recommend me , by the way .
Is it going to look like this beautiful estate is sub-divided ?
Etc. etc .
You &apos;ve got the idea .
And so we finally ended up making it .
These people are art collectors .
And the building is very sculptural as you walk around it .
I keep trying to make it work .
In this case we learned how to detail it .
In Cleveland , there &apos;s Burnham Mall , on the left .
It &apos;s never been finished .
There &apos;s a railroad track .
And the centerline of the mall goes out .
You drive down .
So it &apos;s about a 10-story C-clamp .
This owner has a pet peeve about bad automobile entries .
And this would be a hotel .
It &apos;s hard to do high-rise .
I feel much more comfortable down here .
This is a piece of property in Brentwood .
And that &apos;s it , built .
The dome was a request from the client .
She wanted a dome somewhere in the house .
She didn &apos;t care where .
And it &apos;s very private .
The landscape is being built around to create a private garden .
These aren &apos;t focused very well .
I don &apos;t know how to do it from here .
Focus the one on the right .
It &apos;s up there .
Left -- it &apos;s my right .
That &apos;s the living room .
Servants &apos; quarters .
This is the bedroom .
It looks like I got a Baldessari painting for free .
This is for Michael Eisner -- Disney .
We &apos;re doing some work for him .
Kind of a fun thing to do .
And we struggled with the image .
This is in Paris , along the Seine .
Palais des Sports , the Gare de Lyon over here .
There &apos;s a new library across the river .
They call it the plan coupe .
These are the models for it .
Apartments , etc .
And these are the kind of study models we did .
And the one on the left is pretty awful .
The restaurants here -- the apartments and the theater , etc .
And it faces into a park .
And this will be some kind of high-tech billboard .
I don &apos;t know what to do .
And it &apos;s got a fish .
It &apos;s like a drug addict .
And then I do it .
There it is .
But it &apos;s the living room .
We &apos;ve had a lot of fun working together .
So far .
This is a shopping thing .
And another restaurant .
It &apos;s plaster and just zinc .
I know I &apos;m over time .
See , that skylight goes down and becomes that one .
So it &apos;s pretty quiet inside .
This is the Disney Hall -- the concert hall .
It &apos;s a complicated project .
It has a chamber hall .
And the plan of this -- it &apos;s a concert hall .
There &apos;s commercial at the ground floor .
But finally , there &apos;s a hotel there .
And we studied many models .
This was our original model .
Everybody liked the surround .
That &apos;s the idea .
But you get the sense of the hall in section .
Most halls come straight down into a proscenium .
And so it will be quite a different shape .
And this is a teapot I designed for Alessi .
I just stuck it on there .
Larry Halprin is doing the stairs .
And we split these bridges .
Originally , this was all solid with a hole in it .
And finally , I just threw these in -- Lou Danziger .
A little studio -- and it &apos;s sadly for sale .
Time goes on .
It didn &apos;t work .
Thank you very much .
Nicholas Negroponte : Taking OLPC to Colombia
So , in rough numbers , there are a million laptops .
In Colombia , we have about 3,000 laptops .
And suddenly , the kids have connected laptops .
They &apos;ve leapfrogged .
Before , they were closed off .
Now what are some of the results ?
Probably the most important thing we see is children teaching parents .
They own the laptops . They take them home .
Her mother had not gone to primary school .
This is an education project , not a laptop project .
And then we can actually roll out large numbers .
And think of the laptop as a vaccine .
You don &apos;t vaccinate a few children .
You vaccinate all the children in an area .
Nate Silver : Does racism affect how you vote ?
I want to talk about the election .
And in fact Barack Obama did quite well .
He won 375 electoral votes .
One exception is in Massachusetts .
That was John Kerry &apos;s home state .
He lost badly but every Democrat does .
He lost no worse than most people do .
But yeah , what &apos;s the matter with Arkansas ?
And the answer is : it is at least partially fair .
They asked this question .
Here is the same data on a map .
So we have to ask why .
Is racism predictable in some way ?
Is there something driving this ?
Or are there more systematic factors at work ?
And so we can look at a bunch of different variables .
And you see the relationship there with the racially-based voting patterns .
So yes , racism is predictable .
This is conducted by the University of Chicago every other year .
And they ask a series of really interesting questions .
In 2000 they had particularly interesting questions about racial attitudes .
There is a big difference .
Just based on who lives in your immediate neighborhood around you .
So it &apos;s really not even about urban versus rural .
It &apos;s about who you live with .
I &apos;m a big fan of cities .
So we can think more about things like street grids .
Denis Dutton : A Darwinian theory of beauty
It &apos;s in the eye of the beholder .
It &apos;s whatever moves you personally .
Beethoven is adored in Japan .
Peruvians love Japanese woodblock prints .
How can we explain this universality ?
I mean fossils , cave paintings and so forth .
It did not evolve for natural survival .
In fact , it goes against natural survival .
It &apos;s quite a familiar story .
It &apos;s women who actually push history forward .
He actually used that word .
It would hardly do to eat your baby or your lover .
But , someone might argue , that &apos;s natural beauty .
How about artistic beauty ?
Isn &apos;t that exhaustively cultural ?
No , I don &apos;t think it is .
But artistic and decorative skills are actually much older than that .
But the most intriguing prehistoric artifacts are older even than this .
I have in mind the so-called Acheulian hand axes .
They go back about two-and-a-half-million years .
What were these artifacts for ?
Yes , hairstyling -- I insist on that .
We find beauty in something done well .
Is beauty in the eye of the beholder ?
No , it &apos;s deep in our minds .
Thank you .
Once upon a time , there was a place called Lesterland .
Now Lesterland looks a lot like the United States .
Now , Lesters in Lesterland have this extraordinary power .
There are two elections every election cycle in Lesterland .
One is called the general election .
The other is called the Lester election .
And here &apos;s the trick .
Now , what can we say about democracy in Lesterland ?
Okay . That &apos;s Lesterland .
Number one , the United States is Lesterland .
The United States is Lesterland .
But you must do extremely well .
Now you say , really ?
Really .05 percent ?
In this sense , the funders are our Lesters .
Now , what can we say about this democracy in USA-land ?
Okay , the United States is Lesterland , point number one .
Here &apos;s point number two .
I don &apos;t mean Rod Blagojevich sense of corruption .
I don &apos;t mean any criminal act .
The corruption I &apos;m talking about is perfectly legal .
So here &apos;s the model of government .
This is a corruption .
So the right wants smaller government .
But here &apos;s the bad news .
Block reform .
It feeds on dysfunction .
This is the root .
Okay , now , every single one of you knows this .
You ignore it . This is an impossible problem .
But we cannot ignore this corruption anymore .
We need a government that works .
There will never be a Christmas .
Okay . So how do we do it ?
Turns out , the analytics here are easy , simple .
The analytics are easy here .
Now I get this skepticism .
I get this cynicism . I get this sense of impossibility .
But I don &apos;t buy it .
This is a solvable issue .
You don &apos;t wake up one day no longer a racist .
But this is a problem of just incentives , just incentives .
Irrelevant .
There &apos;s nothing we can do . &quot;
When she said that , I scrambled .
What is that sense of hopelessness ? &quot;
And what hit me was an image of my six-year-old son .
Nothing you can do . &quot;
So would I do nothing ?
I &apos;m going off to build Google Glass .
So here &apos;s my question : Do you have that love ?
Do you have that love ?
A republic . A representative democracy .
A government dependent upon the people alone .
We have lost that republic .
All of us have to act to get it back .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
Gary Greenberg : The beautiful nano details of our world
As we go smaller , here is a human hair .
It &apos;s about a tenth of a millimeter .
That &apos;s how small that is .
This is a ring of cobalt atoms .
So sand is about a tenth of a millimeter in size .
It &apos;s really quite amazing . You have microshells there .
You have things like coral .
You have fragments of other shells . You have olivine .
An amazing array of incredible things exist in sand .
There &apos;s some sand that &apos;s really much more colorful .
Every grain of sand is coming somewhere and going somewhere .
They &apos;re like a snapshot in time .
And you can see those in micrometeorites .
And I started taking pictures with my three-dimensional microscopes .
So sort of left-eye view , right-eye view .
And that &apos;s called a ring agglutinate .
Thank you .
Edith Widder : The weird , wonderful world of bioluminescence
But mostly I &apos;m entranced by it .
I needed some way to share the experience directly .
This is the first time it has ever been recorded .
Oops . Sorry .
Okay .
Well , it uses it to defend itself from its predators .
The flash is like a scream for help .
It &apos;s got a light organ under its eye .
It &apos;s got a chin barbel .
It &apos;s unbelievable .
The light organs under the eyes are flashing .
That chin barbel is flashing .
It &apos;s phenomenal .
There &apos;s other ways you can defend yourself with light .
This blinds or distracts the predator .
It &apos;s phenomenal .
They &apos;re things like this .
This is a golden coral , a bush .
It grows very slowly .
The other reason is this amazing bush glows .
And you see things like this .
And these are flytrap anemones .
Now if you poke it , it pulls in its tentacles .
And it actually ends up looking like a galaxy .
There are starfish that can make light .
Colorization and sound effects added for you viewing pleasure .
But we have no idea why it does that .
Here &apos;s another one . This is also a sea pen .
It &apos;s got a brittle star hitching a ride .
It &apos;s a green saber of light .
This is an optical lure that I &apos;ve used .
We call it the electronic jellyfish .
So the camera &apos;s black and white .
It &apos;s not high-resolution .
And right in the front is the electronic jellyfish .
There &apos;s something small there that responds .
We &apos;re talking to something .
And this was very consistent .
This was in the Bahamas at about 2,000 feet .
But the cool thing is , we &apos;re talking to it .
We don &apos;t know what we &apos;re saying .
Personally , I think it &apos;s something sexy .
We &apos;ve only just begun to analyze all of this data .
That &apos;s a 12-foot-long giant sixgill shark .
And this is a burglar alarm .
This is at 3,000 feet in Monterey Canyon .
It &apos;s supposed to be attacking what &apos;s attacking the jellyfish .
But we did see a bunch of responses like this .
This guy is a little more contemplative .
&quot; Hey , wait a minute .
There &apos;s supposed to be something else there . &quot;
He &apos;s thinking about it .
But he &apos;s persistent .
He keeps coming back .
Nope .
We need more eyes on the process .
But I warn you , it &apos;s addictive .
Thank you .
Vusi Mahlasela : &quot; Thula Mama &quot;
This is your place , you stay here . &quot;
And they left .
Gary Lauder &apos;s new traffic sign : Take Turns
I &apos;ve had some time to think it over .
Fifty percent of crashes happen at intersections .
Roundabouts are much better .
But that &apos;s just safety .
What about time and gas ?
Small roundabouts are starting to appear .
But they are not applicable in all situations .
So , take , for example , the three-way intersection .
But the other two are somewhat questionable .
Cars rarely appear on that third road .
What &apos;s that time worth ?
is $ 20 an hour . That is 60,000 per year .
And you &apos;d still come out ahead .
Can that be accomplished with existing signs ?
So , why not use a yield sign ?
That would not work .
And it merges the stop sign and yield signs .
And uncertainty results in caution .
So , now that you are all &quot; Road Scholars &quot; ...
Maira Kalman : The illustrated woman
And I was writing terrible poetry and knitting sweaters for him .
And we started a studio .
You have to condense a story into 32 pages , usually .
And the Bertoia chair in the background is my favorite chair .
And the books are really journals of my life .
I never -- I don &apos;t like plots .
I don &apos;t know what a plot means .
The letter C had other things in it .
Who are these people ? What are these tribes ?
They &apos;re not . &quot;
I said , people should know about this book .
Do you mind my asking a question ? &quot;
I happen to know it for a fact .
You don &apos;t even know .
&quot; And decided his top people had to be extinctified . &quot;
Too many pogroms .
Facts were actually banished from our home .
So , it &apos;s a miracle that I &apos;m here today .
Well , not so awful .
There &apos;s consoling .
And he says , &quot; It is impossible not to lie .
It is February and not lying is impossible . &quot;
How do we know when we are ourselves ?
I &apos;m going to quickly go through this .
A complicated question .
Oh my God , you know what ?
Could we have -- no , we don &apos;t have time .
Do you have that ?
And she said , &quot; I knew it was he . &quot;
Gershwin died at the age of 38 .
He &apos;s buried in the same cemetery as my husband .
I don &apos;t want to talk about that now .
And I would like to run it for them .
And a woman who lives on our street , Lolita .
And then I go and have some tea .
That &apos;s actually Hy .
Gabe Barcia-Colombo : My DNA vending machine
This is a vending machine in Los Angeles .
It &apos;s a caviar vending machine .
You can kind of tell from their reactions .
And so I started doing this regularly .
This is what that looked like .
And I hadn &apos;t even thought about that .
And so I thought that was interesting .
Here it is .
And how much will these samples be worth ?
And will you buy someone else &apos;s sample ?
And what will you be able to do with that sample ?
Thank you .
Dan Dennett : The illusion of consciousness
But they probably don &apos;t think of these opinions as expertise .
They &apos;re just strongly held opinions .
Simply by being conscious , I know all about this . &quot;
No , you &apos;ve got it all wrong . &quot;
And they say this with an amazing confidence .
That &apos;s the order of the day here .
Now , this nice picture shows a thought-balloon , a thought-bubble .
I think everybody understands what that means .
That &apos;s supposed to exhibit the stream of consciousness .
And this fellow here is looking at the painting by Braque .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re made of .
It speaks so eloquently to the problem .
Real consciousness is not a bag of tricks .
Don &apos;t tell me the answer . &quot;
But I &apos;m not going to explain it all to you .
I &apos;m going to do what philosophers do .
Here &apos;s how a philosopher explains the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick .
You know the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick ?
&quot; He merely makes you think that he does . &quot;
So now I &apos;m going to illustrate how philosophers explain consciousness .
He didn &apos;t even try to do those things .
People &apos;s memories inflate what they think they saw .
And the same is true of consciousness .
Watch it carefully .
We &apos;re looking for a backer .
It &apos;s a feature-length documentary on consciousness .
OK , now , you all saw what changed , right ?
That &apos;s the detail part .
It doesn &apos;t seem that way , does it ?
You &apos;re getting in a lot less information than you think .
It &apos;s in the museum in North Carolina .
Bellotto was a student of Canaletto &apos;s .
And as I got closer and closer , I actually screamed .
There were just little artfully placed blobs of paint .
I &apos;ll just give that to you one more time .
Well , remember the philosopher &apos;s explanation of the lady ?
It &apos;s the same thing .
It &apos;s just making you expect the detail .
Let &apos;s just do this experiment very quickly .
Yes .
How do you know that &apos;s what you did ?
Yes , it &apos;s possible to do that .
But the details of the process are still in significant controversy .
You don &apos;t know how you do it .
You just know that you have certain beliefs .
And what explains the fact that that &apos;s what you think ?
Can you see it ?
It &apos;s a Necker cube .
Can you see the four ways of seeing the cube ?
Because there &apos;s another way of seeing it .
Does your brain have to send little painters in there ?
But Rob Van Lier has recently shown that it isn &apos;t .
Let me just pause this for a second if I can .
This is change-blindness .
So , show the original picture for 240 milliseconds . Blank .
Show the next picture for 240 milliseconds . Blank .
So now we &apos;re going to be subjects in the experiment .
We &apos;re going to start easy . Some examples .
No trouble there .
Can everybody see ? All right .
Can you see that one ?
2.9 seconds .
How many don &apos;t see it still ?
What &apos;s on the roof of that barn ?
It &apos;s easy .
Is it a bridge or a dock ?
I want you to see a few that are particularly striking .
Can you see it ?
Audience : Yes .
How many engines on the wing of that Boeing ?
Right in the middle of the picture !
Thanks very much for your attention .
And he &apos;s right . This is a problem .
If you work on one neuron , that &apos;s neuroscience .
If you work on two neurons , that &apos;s psychology . &quot;
Thank you very much .
Actually , it &apos;s deceptively large .
Obviously a very small community .
There were only two other Dannys on the Internet then .
I knew them both .
So I could have anything I wanted other than bbn.com and symbolics.com.
Maybe I should register a few extras just in case .
It was incredibly successful .
My rough calculation is it would be about 25 miles thick .
I &apos;ll come back to that later .
Now , there was an interesting thing that happened last April .
So for a few hours , it all passed through China .
Imagine how vulnerable the system is to deliberate attacks .
That will not succeed .
Nobody has claimed credit for that .
There was basically a factory of industrial machines .
It didn &apos;t think of itself as being on the Internet .
Everything started breaking .
Now , of course you couldn &apos;t do that today .
It &apos;s constantly changing . It &apos;s constantly reconfiguring .
But so what we need is a plan B.
There is no plan B right now .
This doesn &apos;t need to be a multi-billion-dollar government project .
It &apos;s basically a matter of deciding to do it .
It &apos;s not that hard a problem .
It could definitely be done by people in this room .
Thank you very much .
Stefan Larsson : What doctors can learn from each other
It &apos;s a big part of the national budgets .
And many different reforms aim at holding back this growth .
So no wonder that some of my old colleagues are frustrated .
We call this value-based healthcare .
The differences were dramatic .
That &apos;s a huge difference , a seven-fold difference .
And often , the data actually doesn &apos;t exist .
Nobody knows .
So going the hospital is a lottery .
They all realized they had their individual way of operating .
And they finally agreed .
Everybody saw this makes a lot of sense .
Since then , they publish every year .
Now I found this principle really exciting .
Continuous improvement .
Now , that &apos;s not the only exciting part .
That &apos;s exciting in itself .
We did a study where we looked at OECD data .
They were always best in class .
We were always best in class .
But most of them don &apos;t know .
But physicians have another characteristic .
They actually thrive from peer recognition .
They will share the information on how to improve .
This is happening in reality .
It stands for the International Consortium for Health Outcome Measurement .
Compare apples to apples . Who &apos;s better ?
Why is that ?
The group discussed , how do we measure quality today ?
Can we measure it better than we do ?
There was an enormous energy in the room .
There were so many ideas , so much enthusiasm .
Thank you .
Brian Cox : Why we need the explorers
We live in difficult and challenging economic times , of course .
This is the U.K. government spend .
You see there , it &apos;s about 620 billion a year .
That funds everything in the U.K.
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re arguing about .
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re arguing about .
So it isn &apos;t in the series .
It &apos;s of the moon Enceladus .
It &apos;s about 500 kilometers in diameter .
So , tiny moon .
What &apos;s fascinating and beautiful ...
It &apos;s a beautiful graphic .
That &apos;s one more picture of Enceladus .
This is when Cassini flew beneath Enceladus .
It &apos;s actually an ice moon .
It could be hundreds of kilometers deep , we think .
Tremendous and beautiful discovery .
Well , there is .
Earthrise from Apollo 8 .
The biggest one was in 1975 by Chase Econometrics .
So exploration can pay for itself .
What about scientific discovery ?
What about driving innovation ?
Well , this looks like a picture of virtually nothing .
And they saw strange pictures like this .
And the electrons can only be in particular places .
I just wanted to show this picture because this is remarkable .
This is actually a picture of the spectrum of the Sun .
But look at the number of black lines in that spectrum .
And that &apos;s why helium &apos;s called helium .
It &apos;s called &quot; helios &quot; -- helios from the Sun .
That &apos;s a limit imposed on the mass of stars .
That &apos;s quite an incredible prediction .
Well , this is a picture of it .
It &apos;s just one of billions of galaxies in the universe .
So that star is also 50 million light years away .
That &apos;s a Type Ia supernova explosion .
It &apos;s called a carbon-oxygen dwarf .
In fact , that one is a carbon-oxygen dwarf .
So , I think science can be -- serendipity is important .
It can be beautiful . It can reveal quite astonishing things .
This is a spectacular picture of our home planet .
Now , it doesn &apos;t look like our home planet .
It looks like Saturn because , of course , it is .
It was taken by the Cassini space probe .
And if I blow it up there , you see it .
That &apos;s our planet from 750 million miles away .
The Voyager is a tiny machine .
But it visited Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus and Neptune .
And it took this picture of Earth .
That &apos;s Earth from four billion miles away .
He said , &quot; Consider again that dot .
That &apos;s here . That &apos;s home . That &apos;s us .
Beautiful words about the power of science and exploration .
And it &apos;s made today in these difficult economic times .
Surely , we know enough .
We don &apos;t need to discover anything else about our universe .
He was clearly under assault all the time .
&quot; We know enough at the turn of the 19th century .
Just exploit it ; just build things . &quot;
Thank you .
Janna Levin : The sound the universe makes
The Sun burns our peripheral vision .
We see light reflected off the Moon .
Now black holes are dark against a dark sky .
We can &apos;t see them directly .
They destroy stars around them .
They churn up debris in their surroundings .
But they won &apos;t come to us directly through light .
It was Einstein &apos;s great general theory of relativity .
Now even light will be bent by those paths .
These are the natural curves in space .
And even light could not escape this current .
This is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions .
But Einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical oddity .
He did not believe they existed in nature .
He thought nature would protect us from their formation .
Now our Sun will not collapse to a black hole .
It &apos;s actually not massive enough .
But basically that &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about .
It cannot hide behind the black hole .
So you can &apos;t hide anything behind a black hole .
They can see you .
They can be spinning hundreds of times a second .
This was one of the groups .
You would literally hear the sound .
And we can predict what the sound will be .
Then it &apos;s gone .
At home it sounds kind of anticlimactic .
It &apos;s sort of like ding , ding , ding .
This is another sound from my group .
Want to get away from the sound .
Both black holes are moving .
Both black holes are getting closer together .
In this case , they &apos;re both wobbling quite a lot .
And then they &apos;re going to merge .
Now it &apos;s gone .
Now that &apos;s our prediction for what we &apos;ll see .
In this Hubble image , we see two galaxies .
They look like they &apos;re frozen in some embrace .
But they &apos;re not frozen ; they &apos;re actually merging .
It might make a sound .
So imagine you &apos;re inside the Big Bang .
Imagine a billion years ago , two black holes collided .
That song has been ringing through space for all that time .
We weren &apos;t even here .
It &apos;s like hurry , build your instruments .
It &apos;s getting closer and closer , and in 20 ...
It &apos;s a terrible sound .
It &apos;s literally the definition of noise .
It &apos;s white noise ; it &apos;s such a chaotic ringing .
I mean we have to ask , has it happened before ?
Will it happen again ?
Here &apos;s my multiverse creatures .
Thank you . Thank you .
Joe Kowan : How I beat stage fright
Joe Kowan : I have stage fright .
And it didn &apos;t even matter until I was 27 .
I had this irrational fear .
Well , when I got there , it was packed .
There were like 20 people there .
And they all looked angry .
Next your non-essential systems start to shut down , like digestion .
That condition is not conducive to performing folk music .
I mean , your nervous system is an idiot .
I have never been more terrified -- until now .
I mean , it &apos;s a nightmare .
It was so bad .
But that was my first real experience as a solo singer-songwriter .
I couldn &apos;t shake it .
And that &apos;s when I had an epiphany .
So I started writing a song about having stage fright .
Except for when I was really nervous , like now .
Can I have a sip of water ?
Thank you .
Alan Kay : A powerful idea about ideas
He would have a great time .
We go to magic shows in order to be fooled .
They measure very , very carefully .
Somehow we have to understand ourselves to get around our flaws .
We can think of ourselves as kind of a noisy channel .
I &apos;ll talk about that a little bit .
But how simple ?
And that leaves two open areas that are kind of suspicious ...
and bingo . That is all you have to do .
Now let &apos;s go to young children .
You can see the trapezoids are a little challenging there .
So they had created these artifacts .
&quot; What have you noticed about what you did ? &quot;
So that &apos;s what Lauren did .
Well , that &apos;s pretty amazing .
That isn &apos;t what we usually try to teach six-year-olds .
Each time I click it , car turn .
And I can try steering the car here by ...
See the car turn by five here ?
So what if I click this down to zero ?
It goes straight . That &apos;s a big revelation for nine-year-olds .
Make it go in the other direction .
And we &apos;ll call this a wheel .
See this wheel &apos;s heading here ?
And it &apos;s interesting .
And we can reflect here the way Gillian Ishijima did .
What do I get there ? &quot;
We get a visual pattern of what these nine-year-olds called acceleration .
So how do the children do science ?
Student 1 : Ooh , this is nice .
Who &apos;s got the apple ?
Alan Kay : They &apos;ve got little stopwatches .
AK : Stopwatches aren &apos;t accurate enough .
Student 3 : 0.99 seconds .
Teacher : So put &quot; sponge ball &quot; ...
Teacher : Drop . Class : Whoa !
And they say , &quot; Oh , yeah . Constant acceleration .
We &apos;ve done that already . &quot;
But if I oppose gravity , here we go ... Oops !
One more .
Thank you .
Rives : If I controlled the Internet
I just wish it were more organized . &quot;
So ...
You could navigate and understand every emotional intersection .
Listen , you &apos;ll see being dead is dandy .
Now follow me , OK ?
Grandma.com would be a recipe for biscuits and spit-bath instructions .
One , two , three .
That links with hotdiggitydog.com.
That is my grandfather .
They take you to gruff-ex-cop-on-his-fourth-marriage.dad.
I wouldn &apos;t need it .
Huh ? Maybe Google would hire this .
I guess it &apos;s just like life .
We can interfere with the interface .
You don &apos;t say a prayer .
You don &apos;t write a psalm .
You don &apos;t chant an &quot; om . &quot;
Thank you , TED .
Bill Davenhall : Your health depends on where you live
Can geographic information make you healthy ?
In 2001 I got hit by a train .
My train was a heart attack .
&quot; Why now ? &quot; &quot; Why here ? &quot;
&quot; Could my doctor have warned me ? &quot;
Genetics , lifestyle and environment .
Well , I understand the genetics and lifestyle part .
And you know why I understand that ?
Because my physicians constantly ask me questions about this .
What does that mean , my environment ?
Well , it can mean a lot of things .
This is my life . These are my life places .
We all have these .
You spend it at rest and you spend it at work .
I started off in Scranton , Pennsylvania .
OK , so I ended up in Louisville , Kentucky .
They manufacture plastics . They use large quantities chloroprene and benzene .
It was insidious and it was really happening .
And I moved to Redlands California .
Okay ? Almost like the highest in the nation .
So , what &apos;s wrong with this picture ?
They really don &apos;t do that . It &apos;s missing .
Look at the kind of data that &apos;s available .
Now , I &apos;ve circled the places where I &apos;ve been .
So , how many people are in the white ?
Anybody ? Boy you &apos;re lucky .
How many have spent it in the red places ?
Oh , not so lucky .
But none of that &apos;s in my medical record .
And it &apos;s not in yours either .
So , here &apos;s my friend Paul .
And this is where he has spent most of his time .
Anybody got any clues ? Ski . Right .
Did you know that data existed ?
So , our cell phones can now build a place history .
This might be what we end up with .
This could be my little assessment .
What I &apos;d like to leave you for are two prescriptions .
And they &apos;re in the early stages of development .
But it will also be useful for us .
Just look at that for a minute .
That was what he was talking about on that quote .
Gary Wolf : The quantified self
I got up this morning at 6 : 10 a.m.
after going to sleep at 12 : 45 a.m.
I was awakened once during the night .
I had about 600 milligrams of caffeine , zero of alcohol .
This little black dot there is a 3D accelerometer .
It tracks your movement through space .
This tracks your activity and also your sleep .
It has just that sensor in it .
You &apos;re probably familiar with the Nike + system .
And this is the sleep tracking system of today .
This just was presented at a health care conference in D.C.
Here &apos;s a biometric device : a pair of Apple Earbuds .
What is this for ?
What should it be for ?
Some people will say it &apos;s for biometric security .
Some people will say it &apos;s for public health research .
Some people will say it &apos;s for avant-garde marketing research .
Thank you .
You have to make a wish to save the world . &quot;
I was lost .
The world is fucked up .
Except maybe French people .
Whatever .
I can &apos;t do anything to save the world . &quot;
&quot; Oh , all right . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s cool . &quot;
What about art ?
Could art change the world ?
I started when I was 15 years old .
Each trip was an excursion , was an adventure .
I would control it directly with the public in the streets .
So that &apos;s Paris .
That &apos;s on the Champs-Elysees .
I was quite proud of that one .
Then when the photo left , the frame was still there .
November 2005 : the streets are burning .
I mean , these were the faces of my friends .
I know those guys .
So I went back there with a 28 mm lens .
It was the only one I had at that time .
So you can do it only with their trust .
So I took full portraits of people from Le Bosquet .
They were making scary faces to play the caricature of themselves .
That &apos;s where I realized the power of paper and glue .
So could art change the world ?
Are they so different ?
Asked them to make a face as a sign of commitment .
They all accepted to be pasted next to the other .
We launched the biggest illegal art exhibition ever .
We called the project Face 2 Face .
The experts said , &quot; No way .
The people will not accept .
&quot; It will be as big as your house . &quot;
When we did the wall , we did the Palestinian side .
We had all sorts of help from all walks of life .
Okay , for example , that &apos;s Palestine .
We &apos;re in Ramallah right now .
And those ones are actually two taxi-drivers . &quot;
And then there was always a silence .
And most of them couldn &apos;t say .
We even pasted on Israeli military towers , and nothing happened .
The rain and the wind will take them off anyway .
They are not meant to stay .
So the reactions in the street were kind of interesting .
I called that project Women Are Heroes .
I just observed .
Sometimes there was no words , no sentence , just tears .
I just took their pictures and pasted them .
Women Are Heroes took me around the world .
I was shocked .
All Brazil was shocked .
So I decided to go there .
And she said , &quot; You know what ?
We &apos;re hungry for culture .
We need culture out there . &quot;
So I went out and I started with the kids .
But that &apos;s okay .
I wanted them to feel that this art belongs to them .
They were all linked to the three kids that got killed .
I took more photos , and we started the project .
I &apos;m not interested in filming the violence and the weapons .
You see that enough in the media .
What I want to show is the incredible life and energy .
Everyone there understood the project .
And then we pasted everywhere -- the whole hill .
What was interesting is that the media couldn &apos;t get in .
I mean , you should see that .
So how can we know about the project ?
We kept traveling .
In war-torn places like Monrovia , people come straight to you .
Are you an NGO ? Are you the media ? &quot;
Art . Just doing art .
Don &apos;t you have color in France ? &quot;
Some who understood the project would explain it to others .
This is art . &quot;
And then it becomes more .
It becomes a desire , a need , an armor .
Women are always the first ones targeted during conflict .
Then art becomes useful .
So the people kept it .
So I asked the people what happened .
&quot; Oh , that guy just moved . &quot;
When you look at Kibera now , they look back .
Okay , India .
In India it was just impossible to paste .
So we decided to paste white , white on the walls .
So imagine white guys pasting white papers .
Of course , they were confused .
Thank you .
So we didn &apos;t get caught this time .
Each project -- that &apos;s a film from Women Are Heroes .
Okay .
For each project we do a film .
And the photos kept traveling even without us .
Behind each image is a story .
We did that in most of the places .
We go back regularly .
In Kibera , each year we cover more roofs .
And that has always been a central part of the work .
And I was even invited to cover the MOCA museum .
But tell me , advertising for what ?
But they asked me for a promise basically .
So I did . That &apos;s Paris .
That &apos;s Rio .
You understand the full scope of the project .
That &apos;s London .
New York .
And today , they are with you in Long Beach .
In some ways , art can change the world .
Art can change the way we see the world .
Art can create an analogy .
They would be really useful . &quot;
Or , &quot; How can we help ? &quot;
And this starts right now .
Yes , everyone in the room .
Everyone watching .
I wanted that wish to actually start now .
What we see changes who we are .
And this starts right now and depends on you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Suzanne Lee : Grow your own clothes
So we start by brewing the tea .
And then we &apos;re ready to add the living organism .
And along with that , some acetic acid .
We need to maintain an optimum temperature for the growth .
So this is my mini fabric farm .
So they &apos;re spinning these tiny nano fibers of pure cellulose .
And this is a static culture .
It doesn &apos;t need light .
At this point , it &apos;s really heavy .
So I spread it out onto a wooden sheet .
Using fruit and vegetable staining , create organic patterning .
And using indigo , make it anti-microbial .
What I can &apos;t yet do is make it water-resistant .
Align it in this direction .
Make it hydrophobic .
What excites me about using microbes is their efficiency .
So we only grow what we need .
There &apos;s no waste .
Thank you very much .
This is one of the jackets you grew ?
SL : Yes , it is .
Suzanne Lee .
Jon Nguyen : Tour the solar system from home
I would watch Nova on PBS .
Our school would show Bill Nye the Science Guy .
So what you &apos;re looking at right now is the Earth .
Google Earth goes from this view down to your backyard .
We go from this view out to the stars .
These are a number of our science space Earth orbiters .
All right , so what about the rest of it ?
It &apos;s actually pretty busy .
Here we have Juno on its cruise to Jupiter , there .
You can see how it &apos;s tilted at about 89 degrees .
So now we &apos;ve gone back in time .
We &apos;re now riding along with Voyager 1 .
The date here is November 11 , 1980 .
Now , there &apos;s a funny thing going on here .
It doesn &apos;t look like anything &apos;s going on .
It looks like I &apos;ve paused the program .
It actually has a very thick atmosphere .
There &apos;s a point to be made here .
There &apos;s a whole story to tell here .
If you want to pause it , you can pause it .
It actually flies underneath Saturn .
You can manipulate it yourself .
You can fly around yourself and you can learn for yourself .
Thank you .
Quixotic Fusion : Dancing with light
Andreas Raptopoulos : No roads ? There &apos;s a drone for that
One billion people .
Could we do the same for transportation ?
Imagine this scenario .
What would you do today ?
That &apos;s the part that works .
That &apos;s the part that &apos;s broken .
It &apos;s an ultra-flexible , automated logistics network .
It &apos;s a network for a transportation of matter .
We call it Matternet .
We use three key technologies .
The first is electric autonomous flying vehicles .
First of all , the UAVs .
Today , we &apos;re using small quads .
These fly autonomously .
This is the key to the technology .
The ground stations are located on safe locations on the ground .
People there love this .
So this is a $ 3,000 vehicle .
Costs are coming down very rapidly .
The next big question is , what &apos;s the cost ?
Compare this to normal infrastructure investments .
It can be used perhaps in other places in the world .
Half of the Earth &apos;s population lives in cities today .
Half a billion of us live in megacities .
We are living through an amazing urbanization trend .
Congestion is a huge problem .
So why are we doing this ?
Thank you .
Rives : Reinventing the encyclopedia game
So I tried .
You can start anywhere , this time I chose Earth .
And the first rule of the game is pretty simple .
And it is really fun to say .
You can use it at TED .
Chimborazo , right ?
I didn &apos;t know that ; that &apos;s pretty cool .
Chimborazo !
So the next rule of the game is also pretty simple .
You just have to find another term and look that up .
Nowadays there are hundreds of links to choose from .
They move ; they go up , they go down .
I didn &apos;t know it .
Chimborazo !
Famous for its diversity , human diversity .
This is the most successful order on the planet by far .
Statistically , one of you is a beetle .
And if it is you , you are astonishingly well adapted .
Fireflies are not flies , fireflies are beetles .
Like my next link : The chemical language of pheromones .
Yeah .
And the link to aphrodisiac .
Now that &apos;s something that increases sexual desire , possibly chocolate .
But not when they &apos;re together like that .
I do like sympathy . I do like magic .
This is the boy in me getting lucky again .
Sympathetic magic is imitation .
We &apos;ve got tens-of-thousands-years-old artwork .
He doesn &apos;t .
He lives in rainforests and savannas .
Germans occupied Russia .
You can come back to Earth .
You return to where you started .
You can finish your game .
I found it myself .
It &apos;s got some math that I can do .
I &apos;m pretty sure my dad doesn &apos;t know it .
That &apos;s pretty cool .
I didn &apos;t know that .
Chimborazo !
Thank you .
Fiorenzo Omenetto : Silk , the ancient material of the future
Thank you .
I &apos;m thrilled to be here .
So that &apos;s kind of a bold statement .
I &apos;ll tell you a little bit more .
It actually gets reintegrated in the body .
And the material looks something like this .
In fact , this material you see is clear and transparent .
The components of this material are just water and protein .
So this material is silk .
The process of discovery , generally , is inspired by nature .
And so we get this starting material .
And we take advantage of something that is very simple .
They find their way to self-assemble .
But I mentioned that the film is also technological .
And so what does that mean ?
So let me see .
It &apos;s actually not limited to films .
And so the material can assume a lot of formats .
You can add a third dimensionality to the film .
But you can do other things .
But silk is versatile and it goes beyond optics .
And you can think of different formats .
You can do bigger things .
And the gears work in water as well .
So you think of alternative mechanical parts .
You can do electronic pieces that fold and wrap .
Or if you &apos;re fashion forward , some silk LED tattoos .
But there are still some unique traits .
And you see here a picture of a tissue section .
And you see there , it gets reintegrated in tissue .
So it makes the materials environmentally active and interactive .
So we &apos;ve made a silk card with penicillin in it .
And so what you see there is the difference .
Thank you .
Sandra Aamodt : Why dieting doesn &apos;t usually work
I &apos;m sure many of you know the feeling .
That &apos;s what a thermostat does , right ?
That &apos;s a lot of food .
Successful dieting doesn &apos;t lower your set point .
Sadly , a temporary weight gain can become permanent .
Let &apos;s call them intuitive eaters and controlled eaters .
So don &apos;t do that .
Now let &apos;s look at what happens in overweight people .
But a healthy lifestyle helps obese people too .
Diets don &apos;t have very much reliability .
Forty percent of them have gained even more .
And my answer , in a word , is mindfulness .
How do you do it ?
Sit down to regular meals without distractions .
I often don &apos;t think about it .
I forget we have chocolate in the house .
It &apos;s like aliens have taken over my brain .
It &apos;s just completely different .
Let me leave you with one last thought .
Thanks .
Lee Cronin : Print your own medicine
In essence , could we &quot; app &quot; chemistry ?
Now what could this mean ?
So how are we doing this in the lab ?
So what could this mean ?
You don &apos;t need to go to the chemist anymore .
We can print drugs at point of need .
We can download new diagnostics .
Say a new super bug has emerged .
So this allows you on-the-fly molecular assembly .
Beam me up , Scotty .
Eli Pariser : Beware online &quot; filter bubbles &quot;
It meant a connection to the world .
It meant something that would connect us all together .
They disappeared .
Google &apos;s doing it too .
So here &apos;s my friend Scott &apos;s screen shot .
And here &apos;s my friend Daniel &apos;s screen shot .
Scott &apos;s results were full of them .
That &apos;s how different these results are becoming .
So it &apos;s not just Google and Facebook either .
This is something that &apos;s sweeping the Web .
So I do think this is a problem .
They enter the queue , they just zip right out .
So the best editing gives us a bit of both .
But that &apos;s not actually what &apos;s happening right now .
Then people noticed that they were doing something really important .
We need it to connect us all together .
Thank you .
Alan Russell : The potential of regenerative medicine
There are words that we &apos;re truly afraid of .
It was basically a regenerative medicine issue .
Regenerative medicine is an extraordinarily simple concept that everybody can understand .
This is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine .
This is not regenerative medicine .
And this is just the same .
We &apos;ve come a long way since then .
Why is this important ?
And why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now ?
Just have a look at the demographics in the U.S. here .
This is from &quot; The Untied States of America . &quot;
In 1930 , there were 41 workers per retiree .
In 2010 , two workers per retiree in the U.S.
This is age versus cost of health care .
All those things do is change who pays .
You can prevent .
Obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention .
Think of it in terms of diabetes , for instance .
Today , with diabetes , what do we do ?
And we do OK . Insulin &apos;s a pretty good therapy .
This is a newt re-growing its limb .
It &apos;s a wild concept .
But it &apos;s applicable , again , to every organ system .
How can we do that ?
We need to learn to speak the body &apos;s language .
The first is cellular therapies .
Secondly , we can use materials .
We heard yesterday about the importance of new materials .
And he asked a very important question .
What I &apos;m about to show you is a diabetic ulcer .
This is the reality of diabetes .
This is a diabetic ulcer . It &apos;s tragic .
The treatment for this is amputation .
That &apos;s what the wound looked like 11 weeks later .
That material contained only natural signals .
This is a horse . The horse is not in pain .
Here &apos;s a dolphin where the fin &apos;s been re-attached .
Could you regenerate a limb ?
And I &apos;ll show you the 15 million dollar picture .
Remember that I mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips .
After treatment that &apos;s what it looks like .
This is happening today .
This is clinically relevant today .
But could you go a little further ?
This was done by Teruo Okano at Tokyo Women &apos;s Hospital .
He can actually grow beating tissue in a dish .
It &apos;s the coolest stuff .
Now I &apos;m going to show you cell-based regeneration .
But this one &apos;s kind of cool .
You see the cells coming back out .
This was a randomized trial .
These are now two years out .
There go the cells .
It &apos;s a great source of stem cells .
Stem cells are packed in that liposuction fluid .
So you could go in , you could get your tummy-tuck .
All done in the lab .
Here &apos;s just one example before I close up .
This is equally tragic .
Many of those patients are very severely burned .
And that bio-reactor will lay down in the wound bed .
The gun that you see there sprays cells .
That &apos;s going to spray cells over that area .
It &apos;s a completely different way of doing it .
So my 18 minutes is up .
The good news is that this is happening today .
It &apos;s very powerful work .
Clearly the images kind of get that across .
It &apos;s incredibly difficult because it &apos;s highly inter-disciplinary .
It &apos;s no coincidence .
They need this to work or their health system dies .
The European Union , same thing .
China , the same thing .
China just launched a national tissue-engineering center .
The first year budget was 250 million US dollars .
In the United States we &apos;ve had a somewhat different approach .
We &apos;ve had a different approach .
Thank you .
Terry Moore : Why is &apos; x &apos; the unknown ?
Where &apos;d that come from ?
This includes the little system in Arabic called al-jebra .
Al-jebr finally came into English as algebra .
One example among many .
But there were problems .
Trust me on that one .
Here &apos;s one of the culprits .
So this is al-shalan -- the unknown thing .
But now we have the answer to our question .
Why is it that X is the unknown ?
And I thought that was worth sharing .
Mike Biddle : We can recycle plastic
I &apos;m a garbage man .
And I &apos;d like to start at the very beginning .
Think back when you were just a kid .
How did look at the stuff in your life ?
The entire pile is my stuff if I &apos;m building something .
The more stuff that &apos;s mine , the better .
And let me tell you why I have that perspective .
We see above-ground mines .
In fact , it &apos;s more like five percent .
Most of it &apos;s incinerated or landfilled .
But actually , plastics are several times more valuable than steel .
They have very different densities .
They have different electrical and magnetic properties .
And they even have different colors .
Plastics have overlapping densities over a very narrow range .
They have either identical or very similar electrical and magnetic properties .
And they extract the metals by hand .
I call this environmental arbitrage .
This is just one example .
They store the plastics on the roofs .
Because after all , we &apos;re doing above-ground mining .
And we eventually broke the code .
This is the last frontier of recycling .
And we finally figured out how to do it .
The traditional way to make plastics is with oil or petrochemicals .
Well a good place to start is with waste .
We have significantly lower capital costs in our plant equipment .
We have enormous energy savings .
Our customers get to enjoy huge CO2 savings .
They get to close the loop with their products .
And they get to make more sustainable products .
Even an occasional dead animal , unfortunately .
It looks like the Willy Wonka factory at this point .
We then use optical sorting to color sort this material .
We blend it in 50,000-lb. blending silos .
And we chop those strands into what are called pellets .
And this becomes the currency of the plastics industry .
This is the same material that you would get from oil .
We took our clues from mother nature .
Mother nature wastes very little , reuses practically everything .
Thank you for your time .
Lalitesh Katragadda : Making maps to fight disaster , build economies
In 2008 , Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmar .
Millions of people were in severe need of help .
The U.N. wanted to rush people and supplies to the area .
But help was coming .
And it took them four days .
The new software they used ? Google Mapmaker .
Maps matter .
Welcome to the new world .
Nathan Myhrvold : Cooking as never seen before
I &apos;ve been interested in food for a long time .
I went to chef school in France .
And it &apos;s largely what you would find in these books .
And it &apos;s a wonderful thing .
But that &apos;s not in any of those books .
There &apos;s a chef in Spain named Ferran Adria .
He &apos;s developed a very avant-garde cuisine .
None of them are taught in cooking schools .
This is a picture called a cutaway .
This is actually the first picture I took in the book .
And the hope was two-fold .
Steaming ought to be faster .
So here &apos;s another one .
We discovered why woks are the shape they are .
And one of our canning cutaways .
Here &apos;s our hamburger cutaway .
Of course , you &apos;re not actually working the whole time .
Most of the time is kind of sitting there .
Buying mesquite charcoal will not actually make that much difference .
Mostly it comes from fat pyrolyzing , or burning .
Now you might wonder , how do we make these cutaways ?
Most people assume we use Photoshop .
We cut a $ 5,000 restaurant oven in half .
We used a red , very high-temperature silicon to do that .
In most cases , though , there was no glass .
Like for the hamburger , we just cut the damn barbecue .
The wok shot caught fire three times .
One of our cooks lost his eyebrows that way .
But hey , they grow back .
In addition to cutaways , we also explain physics .
This is Fourier &apos;s law of heat conduction .
It &apos;s a partial differential equation .
We &apos;ve got lots of little tidbits in the book .
Everybody knows that your various appliances have wattage , right ?
But you probably don &apos;t know that much about James Watt .
We also did a lot of calculation .
As you move side to side , it moves off .
That horn-shaped region is what we call the sweet spot .
So that &apos;s the place where you really want to cook .
Here &apos;s a step-by-step that shows grinding hamburger .
And it &apos;s really simple , as you can see here .
Here &apos;s the final hamburger .
This is the 30-hour hamburger .
We make every aspect of this burger .
The lettuce has got liquid smoke infused into it .
We also have things about how to make the bun .
The popcorn is illustrating a key thing in physics .
Isn &apos;t that beautiful ?
That &apos;s what &apos;s happening to the water inside that popcorn .
So it &apos;s a great illustration of that .
We have a chapter on gels .
Anyway , here &apos;s the book .
Here it is .
2,438 pages .
And they &apos;re nice big pages too .
Brian Greene : Is our universe the only universe ?
Now the idea of a multiverse is a strange one .
Now this was revolutionary .
What &apos;s pushing on it ?
And this explanation represents great progress .
But I promised you a mystery here in part one .
Here it is .
This number is small .
Expressed in the relevant unit , it is spectacularly small .
And the mystery is to explain this peculiar number .
Now you might wonder , should you care ?
First off , what is it ?
And the central idea of string theory is quite straightforward .
And in string theory , vibration determines everything .
So , what to do ?
Here &apos;s the idea .
Which means we have been asking the wrong question .
And that &apos;s a question on which we can make headway .
And that would be that .
Mystery solved , multiverse found .
Now some find this explanation unsatisfying .
Kepler was asking the wrong question .
And again , that &apos;s a question we can answer .
And that takes me to my final part , part three .
But there &apos;s a little secret .
The Big Bang leaves out something pretty important , the Bang .
Each of these universes has extra dimensions .
The extra dimensions take on a wide variety of different shapes .
The different shapes yield different physical features .
Well let me describe one way that might one day happen .
The inflationary theory already has strong observational support .
But would those future astronomers believe such ancient knowledge ?
I suspect the latter .
It appears that it may not always be that way .
and the message echoing across the ages is clear .
Thank you very much .
Brian , thank you .
Well it &apos;s hard to say .
Holy cow ! That &apos;s just amazing .
You &apos;re going to be around for the next few days .
Maybe some of these conversations can continue .
Thank you . Thank you , Brian .
Michael Tilson Thomas : Music and emotion through time
Yet , he was my greatest teacher .
But he was tough when it came to music .
That was his passion for the music .
Both my parents really loved it .
Brah dada dadadadah . &quot;
And he ran around the bases .
And I thought , go figure .
It &apos;s a language that &apos;s still evolving .
It &apos;s so simple , so evocative .
So many emotions seem to be inside of it .
It &apos;s just a design of pitches and silence and time .
They &apos;re locations in the spectrum of sound .
And in the 17th century , it was more like this .
And in the 21st century ...
Mozart was the same way .
This was truly the music of the spheres .
Singer : Ah , bitter blow !
Ah , wicked , cruel fate !
Ah , baleful stars !
Ah , avaricious heaven !
But what &apos;s the actual difference between these two chords ?
It &apos;s just these two notes in the middle .
So the big difference between human happiness and sadness ?
37 freakin &apos; vibrations .
Now with all this possibility , classical music really took off .
Now this moment so fascinates me .
I find it such a profound one .
What happens when the music stops ?
Where does it go ? What &apos;s left ?
And how might that change their lives ?
To me this is the intimate , personal side of music .
And to me that &apos;s the most essential of all .
And technology democratized music by making everything available .
Nobody knows .
The question remains : What happens when the music stops ?
What sticks with people ?
And the exciting thing is all this is just a prototype .
We need your perspectives , your curiosity , your voices .
You don &apos;t need to worry about knowing anything .
You can start anywhere . Ramble a bit .
Follow traces . Get lost . Be surprised , amused inspired .
Thank you .
Boghuma Kabisen Titanji : Ethical riddles in HIV research
Maybe this particular trial yielded exciting results .
Maybe it even got published in a high-profile scientific journal .
The first of these is informed consent .
Thank you .
Jared Diamond : How societies can grow old better
I &apos;m going to talk about growing older in traditional societies .
In which tribal societies do children abandon or kill their parents ?
It happens mainly under two conditions .
They face a cruel situation of no choice .
In those societies , older people are cared for .
They are fed . They remain valuable .
Older Americans are at a big disadvantage in job applications .
They &apos;re at a big disadvantage in hospitals .
We Americans move on the average every five years .
That &apos;s a huge problem .
They &apos;ve already gained experience from raising their own children .
Unfortunately , all of those terrible situations could come back .
Older people have that experience .
Younger people don &apos;t .
Some abilities , of course , decrease with age .
They think more realistically about dangers than we do .
Thank you .
Jae Rhim Lee : My mushroom burial suit
And it &apos;s everywhere .
But it &apos;s just one chemical .
The Center for Disease Control in the U.S.
To me , this says three things .
First , don &apos;t become a cannibal .
So what happens to all these toxins when we die ?
But our current funeral practices make the situation much worse .
I think there &apos;s a better solution .
Just a little .
And now about these ninja pajamas .
I &apos;m wearing the second prototype of this burial suit .
I believe this is the beginning of true environmental responsibility .
Thank you .
Jonathan Klein : Photos that changed the world
Okay , we &apos;re naive , we &apos;re bright-eyed and bushy-tailed .
So let &apos;s begin with a group of images .
But I think we &apos;re looking for something more .
We &apos;re looking for something more .
Well , this image you &apos;ve all seen .
It changed our view of the physical world .
We had never seen our planet from this perspective before .
This destructive power takes many different forms .
There &apos;s another kind of crucifixion .
Let &apos;s go back a little .
In fact , these images became the voices of protest themselves .
Did the images change the world ?
No , but they had a major impact .
John Moore set up this photo at Arlington Cemetery .
My company has 70 million images .
I have one image in my office .
Here it is .
And thank you to all the photographers .
John Hunter : Teaching with the World Peace Game
I &apos;m very fortunate to be here .
I feel so fortunate .
I &apos;ve been so impressed by the kindness expressed to me .
It &apos;s a true feeling .
And she &apos;s a very high-tech superintendent .
She &apos;s a technology leader and instructional leader .
Why is this old table in your office ? &quot;
It all started back in 1977 .
It was an experimental education program .
Gifted education hadn &apos;t really taken hold too much .
There weren &apos;t really many materials or things to use .
And I said , &quot; What do I do ? &quot;
And her answer shocked me . It stunned me .
She said , &quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And that question cleared the space .
His name is Chris Farina .
Chris Farina is here today at his own cost .
But the film has really gone places .
And it &apos;s a beautiful thing .
What I saw was my teachers coming through me .
That &apos;s the smile I use -- that &apos;s his smile .
I saw Jan Polo &apos;s flashing eyes .
And I have that kind of flash sometimes .
And you know , she had that old-school teacher stare .
You know the one .
You know that teacher ?
And Miss Banks was there as a great mentor for me .
And then I saw my own parents , my first teachers .
My father , very inventive , spatial thinker .
That &apos;s my brother Malcolm there on the right .
I am one of her teaching gestures .
It &apos;s an amazing feeling to have that lineage .
I &apos;m not here alone .
There are many people on this stage right now .
I was creating a lesson for students on Africa .
I didn &apos;t want to lecture or have just book reading .
So I thought , well they like to play games .
And it has four Plexiglass layers .
There are four countries around the board .
They have different assets , commercial and military .
And each country has a cabinet .
I choose the Prime Minister based on my relationship with them .
That &apos;s not all .
So that , if one thing changes , everything else changes .
And they &apos;ve done it several times too .
But they &apos;re also trying to undermine everything in the game .
I &apos;m just a clock watcher .
I &apos;m just a clarifier . I &apos;m just a facilitator .
The students run the game .
So I &apos;ll just share with you ...
Boy : The World Peace Game is serious .
And so I apologize to them as well .
Now you may be wondering what all this complexity looks like .
It &apos;s a serious question : who is really in charge ?
To her girlfriends she said that .
That &apos;s a breach there .
They are the toughest opponents .
And we were very upset .
I could not have designed that in teaching it .
It came about spontaneously through their collective wisdom .
Another example , a beautiful thing happened .
We have a letter in the game .
&quot; Let &apos;s ask that mom to read the letter .
It &apos;ll be more realer if she reads it . &quot;
She read two sentences .
By the third sentence , she was in tears .
I was in tears .
We all lose .
And it was an amazing occurrence and an amazing understanding .
I &apos;ll show you what my friend David says about this .
He &apos;s been in many battles .
David : We &apos;ve really had enough of people attacking .
JH : I get chills every time I see that .
That &apos;s the kind of engagement you want to have happen .
But it &apos;s self-evident assessment .
We know that &apos;s an authentic assessment of learning .
So I &apos;ll just share a third story .
This is about my friend Brennan .
Some are poor , some are wealthy . There are billions .
The World Bank president was a third-grader one time .
So the team that was the poorest had gotten even poorer .
There was no way they could win .
I thought , I &apos;m failing as a teacher .
I should have gotten it so they could have won .
They shouldn &apos;t be failing like this .
I &apos;ve failed them .
And I was just feeling so sad and dejected .
They get these dossiers full of secret documents .
They were gesticulating ; they were running around .
Principal walks in , I &apos;m out of a job .
The parents were looking in the window .
And we &apos;ve got 600 billion dollars .
Will you accept it ? &quot;
And there are three seconds left on the clock .
And the game is won .
Every game we play is different .
Some games are more about warfare .
If only .
Nic Marks : The Happy Planet Index
He said , &quot; I have a dream . &quot;
And I have a dream .
We have focused on the worst-case scenario .
We have focused on the problems .
And we have not thought enough about the solutions .
People are freezing and running away because we &apos;re using fear .
What would it be like to be improving the human lot ?
Come on . In the Western world , we have enough .
This is from a global survey .
It &apos;s asking people , what do they want .
Okay , they think money is slightly important .
We all need to love and be loved in life .
It &apos;s not nearly as important as health .
We want to be healthy and live a full life .
These seem to be natural human aspirations .
Why are statisticians not measuring these ?
That should be the goal of every nation on the planet .
And economics is very interested in scarcity .
It is an efficiency measure .
More is bad .
It &apos;s about the well-being of nations .
It &apos;s like a happiness adjusted life-expectancy .
It &apos;s like quality and quantity of life in nations .
In Hobbesian terms , life is short and brutish there .
But now for the good news !
This is an aspirational graph .
They &apos;re Latin American .
Maybe some of you have .
Costa Rica .
Costa Rica -- average life expectancy is 78-and-a-half years .
That is longer than in the USA .
They are the happiest place .
What &apos;s going on there ?
What &apos;s happening in Costa Rica ?
We can look at some of the data .
99 percent of their electricity comes from renewable resources .
They abolished the army in 1949 -- 1949 .
And they invested in social programs -- health and education .
And they have that Latin vibe , don &apos;t they .
They have the social connectedness .
It might be Latin American .
That &apos;s what we need to do .
And then we &apos;re starting to create a happy planet .
That &apos;s one way of looking at it .
Another way of looking at it is looking at time trends .
It &apos;s actually not very long away .
It &apos;s half a human lifetime away .
A child entering school today will be my age in 2050 .
This is not the very distant future .
That is changing our business .
I think we want it to carry on .
They want to hold on to what they &apos;ve got .
And that means we have to really increase efficiency even more .
Human beings are very motivated by the &quot; now . &quot;
What would that look like for society ?
And why do I hear that ?
That &apos;s how you create a collective goal .
At a personal level , we need these nudges too .
What are these for happiness ?
Keep building them .
The second one is be active .
Being active is great for our positive mood .
The third one is take notice .
It &apos;s more curiosity .
Keep learning .
We feel good if we give .
They don &apos;t have any carbon content .
Human beings want to be happy .
Pave them with the five ways .
Shirin Neshat : Art in exile
Well , it has its pluses and minuses .
Politics have defined our lives .
We are there to take pride and insist on respect .
And at the same time , we &apos;re fighting another battle .
Our artists are at risk .
We are in a position of danger .
We pose a threat to the order of the government .
Art is our weapon .
Culture is a form of resistance .
I did not start to make social commentary about my country .
It was after the Islamic Revolution of 1979 .
For me , this became incredibly important .
And yet , I had an unusual position toward this .
So my art became slightly more critical .
My knife became a little sharper .
And I fell into a life in exile .
I am a nomadic artist .
I work in Morocco , in Turkey , in Mexico .
I go everywhere to make believe it &apos;s Iran .
Now I am making films .
The book is written by an Iranian woman , Shahrnush Parsipur .
It &apos;s a magical realist novel .
These are some of the shots actually from my film .
These are some of the images of the coup .
The challenge I have is how to do that .
How to tell a political story but an allegorical story .
The green movement significantly inspired the world .
They &apos;re absolutely inspirational for me .
That , under all circumstances , they have pushed the boundary .
They have confronted the authority .
And once again , they proved themselves .
Thank you so much .
Beau Lotto : Optical illusions show how we see
I want to start with a game .
So , we have two panels here , of colored dots .
And you have to tell me which one .
Really ? Okay .
How many people think it &apos;s the green one ?
And how many people think it &apos;s the orange one ?
Pretty even split .
Let &apos;s find out what the reality is .
Here is the orange one .
Here is the green one .
And here is the gray one .
And instead of telling you , I &apos;ll just show you .
Can anyone see it ? Anyone ? No ?
And now you see it .
And these are two projections from the world .
They are identical in every single way .
Identical in shape , size , spectral content .
And yet they come from completely different sources .
And yet it &apos;s only the retinal information that we get .
So how on Earth do we even see ?
There is no inherent meaning in information .
It &apos;s what we do with that information that matters .
Audience : &quot; Can you read this ? &quot;
&quot; You are not reading this . &quot;
&quot; What are you reading ? &quot;
But you put one there . Why ?
So you don &apos;t do it again .
So , if I could have the lights down up here .
One is simply the flipping of the other . Okay ?
But I really want you to learn .
That &apos;s what it &apos;s learning . Okay ?
So why don &apos;t you do that now ?
Can I have the lights up again ?
That &apos;s your new normal .
So , what does this mean for context ?
And the same thing over on the right .
And see what happens to your perception .
So you see it that way .
So you see it that way .
This is one I made a few years ago .
The four blue tiles on the left are gray .
The seven yellow tiles on the right are also gray .
They are the same . Okay ?
Don &apos;t believe me ? Let &apos;s watch it again .
Now I want you to keep looking at it .
Move your eyes around , blink , maybe close one eye .
Yes ? Raise your hand if you got that . Yes ?
So I can ask you , which direction is it rotating ?
How do you know ?
Your brain doesn &apos;t know . Because both are equally likely .
Are we the only ones that see illusions ?
The answer to this question is no .
So in my lab , we of course work on bumblebees .
And we do this in what we call the Bee Matrix .
And you &apos;ll see one of the bees come out here .
You see how she has a little number on her ?
Now , they are not born that way . Right ?
And then you can superglue little numbers on them .
And here she comes down the ladder .
But what are these bees doing in the upper right corner ?
It looks like they &apos;re going to green flowers .
Now , are they getting it wrong ?
But those are blue flowers under green light .
Okay , this is complete rubbish .
And how we see is by continually redefining normality .
And they can navigate the world using their ears .
On the left is what his camera sees .
That line is broken up into 32 squares .
In each square we calculate the average color .
And then we just simply translate that into sound .
He finds it . Amazing . Right ?
And then we translated these images .
And this is one of those images .
And this is what it sounds like .
So , a six-year-old child . Okay ?
Now , what does all this mean ?
And that ecology is necessarily relative , historical and empirical .
Because I think only through uncertainty is there potential for understanding .
So , if we have the lights down .
I &apos;m going to do this opposite on the left here .
Agreed ? Yes ?
Okay . So they are physically the same .
Let &apos;s pull the covers off .
Do they look the same ? No .
The question is , &quot; Is that an illusion ? &quot;
And I &apos;ll leave you with that .
So , thank you very much .
David Pogue : The music wars
A TED medley -- a TEDley .
Martin Seligman : The new era of positive psychology
And she said , &quot; Well , one . &quot;
&quot; Good . &quot;
&quot; Cut . Cut . That won &apos;t do .
We &apos;d really better give you a longer sound bite . &quot;
Doctor Seligman , what is the state of psychology today ? &quot;
&quot; Not good . &quot;
We &apos;d better give you a real sound bite .
This time you can have three words .
Professor Seligman , what is the state of psychology today ? &quot;
So , why was psychology good ?
That we could create a classification of the mental illnesses .
That we could understand the causality of the mental illnesses .
And we forgot that people made choices and decisions .
We forgot responsibility . That was the first cost .
The second cost was that we forgot about you people .
We forgot about improving normal lives .
No one works on that .
So that was not good .
It should be interested in the best things in life .
It turns out that we can measure different forms of happiness .
And how do they differ from the rest of us ?
And it turns out there &apos;s one way .
They don &apos;t sit in seminars on Saturday morning .
They don &apos;t spend time alone .
About 120 interventions have been proposed that allegedly make people happy .
That is , which ones actually make people lastingly happier ?
The first happy life is the pleasant life .
That &apos;s what Aristotle was talking about .
And third , the meaningful life .
And , as I said , it &apos;s not particularly malleable .
And this leads to the second life .
Len is an introvert .
But it turned out there wasn &apos;t any sexual trauma .
You &apos;re one with the music . Time stops .
You have intense concentration .
Hated the job .
She &apos;s working her way through college .
Now obviously she failed .
What you get out of that is not smiley-ness .
You don &apos;t look like Debbie Reynolds .
The second path is eudaimonian flow .
And the third path is meaning .
This is the most venerable of the happinesses , traditionally .
It &apos;s being done in a rigorous manner .
Close your eyes .
The person has to be alive . OK .
Now , OK , you can open your eyes .
I hope all of you have such a person .
And fun versus philanthropy .
So those are examples of positive interventions .
The pursuit of meaning is the strongest .
The pursuit of engagement is also very strong .
But they were empty .
AnnMarie Thomas : Hands-on science with squishy circuits
I &apos;m a huge believer in hands-on education .
But you have to have the right tools .
And so we spent a summer looking at different Play-Doh recipes .
You see that really salty Play-Doh ?
Well , it conducts electricity .
And this is nothing new .
And that sugar dough ?
So what does that mean ?
And so I want to do a little demo for you .
If I push these together , the light turns off .
If I separate them again , I have some light .
It &apos;s like a wall to the electricity .
I plug in again the power to it .
And now I can start talking about parallel and series circuits .
I can start plugging in lots of lights .
And we can start talking about things like electrical load .
It &apos;ll dim .
You could do parallel and series circuits for kids using this .
So this is all in your home kitchen .
We &apos;ve got some videos . You can make them yourselves .
Have fun . Thank you .
Billy Graham : On technology and faith
And I was so stimulated .
Richard can answer that , because he made that decision .
I was to address a conference at a hotel .
And the man said , &quot; No , who ? &quot;
He said , &quot; You don &apos;t say ! &quot;
He said , &quot; Your sermons have certainly helped me . &quot;
And I suppose that that &apos;s true with thousands of people .
We &apos;ve had others .
And there &apos;s one that I want to talk about .
He was a man of tremendous leadership .
He had the favor of God with him .
There were many problems still left .
The first one that David saw was human evil .
Where does it come from ?
How do we solve it ?
And yet he says , &quot; He restores my soul . &quot;
Have you ever thought about what a contradiction we are ?
But on the other hand , something is wrong .
Now , what causes this ?
And revolutions ?
But he made this statement .
The Oklahoma City bombing was simple technology , horribly used .
The problem is not technology .
The problem is the person or persons using it .
We are a soul .
What &apos;s life all about ? Why am I here ?
I went to Ambassador Dobrynin , whom I knew very well .
What shall I talk to her about ? &quot;
And he surprised me with the answer .
He said , &quot; Talk to her about religion and philosophy .
That &apos;s what she &apos;s really interested in . &quot;
I haven &apos;t given a talk in nearly four months .
I &apos;m not reading . I never read an address .
I never read a speech or a talk or a lecture .
I talk ad lib .
We have families that self-destruct , friends that betray us .
Unbearable psychological pressures bear down on us .
He said , &quot; The Lord is my shepherd . &quot;
Most people live as if they &apos;re never going to die .
Technology projects the myth of control over our mortality .
We see people on our screens .
They don &apos;t know that she &apos;s dead .
Or Clark Gable , or whoever it is .
The old stars , they come to life .
But death is inevitable .
And we were meeting in that room , the statue room .
About 300 of them were there .
I said , &quot; We &apos;re all going to die .
And it &apos;s often difficult for young people to understand that .
I &apos;ve talked to them .
Was there a God ?
It passes so fast . &quot;
But it does not need to have to be that way .
On the contrary , they &apos;re sisters . &quot;
He put it on a personal basis .
I knew Dr. von Braun very well .
And I said , &quot; Sir , I do . &quot;
He said , &quot; So do I. &quot;
Blaise Pascal asked exactly that question in seventeenth-century France .
Pascal has been called the architect of modern civilization .
Pascal saw us as a remarkable mixture of genius and self-delusion .
Equally well known is Pascal &apos;s Wager .
For Pascal , scientific knowledge paled beside the knowledge of God .
I didn &apos;t make good grades in high school .
One day , I was faced face-to-face with Christ .
Can you imagine that ? &quot; I am the truth .
I &apos;m the embodiment of all truth . &quot;
He was a liar .
Or he was insane .
Or he was what he claimed to be .
Which was he ?
I had to make that decision .
I couldn &apos;t prove it .
Thank you , and God bless all of you .
Thank you for the privilege . It was great .
Richard Wurman : You did it .
Thanks .
Patricia Ryan : Don &apos;t insist on English !
I know what you &apos;re thinking .
I get that all the time in Dubai .
&quot; Here on holiday are you , dear ? &quot;
&quot; Come to visit the children ?
How long are you staying ? &quot;
Well actually , I hope for a while longer yet .
Now that statistic is quite shocking .
How did those students get all that knowledge ?
Of course , from their grandparents and even their great-grandparents .
A language dies every 14 days .
Could there be a connection ?
Well I don &apos;t know .
Actually , not that long ago .
That is a little bit too early .
Okay .
And why not ?
So everybody wants to have an English education , naturally .
Perhaps you have a computer scientist who &apos;s a genius .
Well , I don &apos;t think so .
We English teachers reject them all the time .
I don &apos;t think so .
But indeed , that is exactly what we do .
We English teachers are the gatekeepers .
Maybe the barrier would be too universal .
Okay .
It &apos;s all in English . &quot;
It feeds the English requirement .
And so it goes on .
I ask you , what happened to translation ?
And so light shone upon the Dark Ages of Europe .
I love it that we have a global language .
We need one today more than ever .
But I am against using it as a barrier .
Case in point , Einstein .
Now it &apos;s exploded .
There are lots and lots of tests of English .
And millions and millions of students take these tests every year .
So immediately , we &apos;re rejecting them .
They want to give their children the best chance in life .
And to do that , they need a Western education .
It &apos;s a circular thing .
Okay .
But they couldn &apos;t get the results they wanted .
So bingo , problem solved .
If you can &apos;t think a thought , you are stuck .
My daughter came to England from Kuwait .
She had studied science and mathematics in Arabic .
It &apos;s an Arabic medium school .
She had to translate it into English at her grammar school .
And she was the best in the class at those subjects .
So he invented a cost-free solar lamp .
A simple idea , but it could have such far-reaching consequences .
Let us not keep them and ourselves in the dark .
Let us celebrate diversity .
Mind your language .
Use it to spread great ideas .
Thank you very much .
Alex Steffen : The shareable future of cities
That shouldn &apos;t be news to any of us .
We will be an overwhelmingly urban species .
And people are embracing this .
Some of it &apos;s transportation access .
This is Google Walking Maps .
Okay . I do too .
Buildings are becoming bundles of services .
So we light our buildings with daylight .
We cool them with breezes . We heat them with sunshine .
These things actually become cheaper to build than the alternatives .
This is one way to do it .
So we have visions like this .
We have visions like this . We have visions like this .
Water is energy intensive .
Thank you very much .
Angela Patton : A father-daughter dance ... in prison
My daddy , he calls me all the time . &quot;
&quot; I haven &apos;t heard from my dad in years . &quot;
The wisdom lives inside of them .
They were dressed to the nines .
They acted sweet .
They acted silly .
They really enjoyed each other &apos;s company .
It was a huge success .
And the girls decided to make it an annual event .
&quot; Why not ? &quot; the girls asked .
&quot; Because he &apos;s in jail , &quot; she bravely admitted .
&quot; And come in shackles ?
That &apos;s worse than not having him here at all . &quot;
We want every girl to experience the dance , right ? &quot;
Because that &apos;s what they called them .
So , 16 inmates and 18 girls were invited .
They hugged .
They shared a full catered meal of chicken and fish .
They laughed together .
It was beautiful .
Even the guards cried .
I have had my father in my life always .
He &apos;s even here today .
Dennis vanEngelsdorp : A plea for bees
Now , that &apos;s an awful lot of bees .
And most of those losses are because of things we know .
And this flu has wiped through the population of bees .
But we think this virus is pretty ubiquitous .
We think perhaps it &apos;s a combination of factors .
No formal education , but very knowledgeable .
And these migratory beekeepers are the last nomads of America .
And although I highly encourage you , all use honey .
And bees are very faithful .
And of course , they &apos;re made to carry this pollen .
However , honeybees are a minority .
We have identified over 400 species of bees in Pennsylvania .
We have bumblebees on the top .
They &apos;re like tiny little flies and they fly around .
Dennis vanEngelsdorp : Bee . Okay , thanks .
And bats are dying at an extraordinary rate .
White-nose syndrome has wiped out populations of bats .
And I think that there is an easy cure for NDD .
And that is , make meadows and not lawns .
And so we need to rethink this idea .
And I encourage you to look at that .
Danielle de Niese : A flirtatious aria
Eve Ensler : Embrace your inner girl
Namaste . Good morning .
I &apos;m very happy to be here in India .
And I want to call it the girl cell .
And it &apos;s in men as well as in women .
To be a boy really means not to be a girl .
To be a man means not to be a girl .
To be a woman means not to be a girl .
To be strong means not to be a girl .
To be a leader means not to be a girl .
For me , it was the turning point of my life .
His name is Dr. Denis Mukwege .
My mind was so shattered .
Because my crying somehow exposed his brutality to him .
I know that we have systematically annihilated the girl cell .
And I will tell you a very funny story .
I &apos;ve seen girls be treated like garbage cans .
The selling of girls is rampant across the planet .
Girls are trained to please .
I want to change the verb .
I want us all to change the verb .
And she was holding her baby .
And I asked her if she loved her baby .
It &apos;s my baby and it &apos;s full of love . &quot;
They kidnapped her , they put her in a car .
So , for years Agnes walked through the Rift valley .
She has literally become deputy mayor .
She &apos;s changed the rules .
The whole community has bought in to what she &apos;s doing .
And there was a young girl named Jaclyn .
And she knew that meant she would be cut .
She knew that meant she wouldn &apos;t go to school .
She knew that meant she wouldn &apos;t have a future .
She slept with the hyenas . She hid at night .
And when she got to the house she was greeted .
We will not cut you .
For me , that is the power of girls .
And that is the power of transformation .
And I want to do it for Sunitha .
This is called &quot; I &apos;m An Emotional Creature . &quot;
And it happened because I met a girl in Watts , L.A.
It &apos;s all bad . My brothers get everything . &quot;
I &apos;m an emotional creature ! &quot;
This is for her : I love being a girl .
I am an emotional creature .
I know when a storm is coming .
I can feel the invisible stirrings in the air .
I am an emotional creature .
I love that I do not take things lightly .
I am an emotional creature .
These feelings make me better .
I am an emotional creature .
There is a particular way of knowing .
It &apos;s like the older women somehow forgot .
I rejoice that it &apos;s still in my body .
Oh , I know when the coconut &apos;s about to fall .
I know we have pushed the Earth too far .
And you know what ? Sometimes it should .
I am an emotional creature .
You don &apos;t tell the Atlantic Ocean to behave .
I am an emotional creature .
I am your remaining memory .
I can take you back .
Nothing &apos;s been diluted .
Nothing &apos;s leaked out .
Can you say it with me ?
Thank you very much .
Rives : The 4 a.m. mystery
This is a recent comic strip from the Los Angeles Times .
The punch line ?
This is a recent cover of New York Magazine .
A time for inconveniences , mishaps , yearnings .
It is four in the morning . &quot;
They worked until four o &apos;clock in the morning .
And it made me suspicious .
Could it be there is something more going on here ?
I call this The Giacometti Code , a TED exclusive .
Results vary , of course . This is pretty typical .
But he didn &apos;t die on Dench &apos;s birthday .
Where was Wislawa Szymborska during all this ?
She has the world &apos;s most absolutely watertight alibi .
Coincidence ? No , it &apos;s creepy .
Coincidence to me has a much simpler metric .
Now do you need towels , laundry , maids ?
It is Christmas Day , 4 a.m.
There &apos;s a rumble in my stomach .
Marge Simpson : Homer , please .
Let me see if I got this straight , Matt .
Parse it cover to cover for whatever hidden references you want .
Would you believe about a dozen paragraphs ?
It had gotten a lot better since 4 a.m. &quot;
Well , how could it have ?
What happens to American presidents at 0400 on inauguration day ?
What happened to William Jefferson Clinton ?
We might not ever know .
It could get awkward , right ?
In generations .
George Dyson : The birth of the computer
This was a perfect introduction .
And it was a technology that was inevitable .
He said you needed addition and subtraction .
You could do the whole thing with addition .
And that &apos;s really the simplest computer .
That &apos;s where I grew up as a kid .
All these forces came together there , in Princeton .
Oppenheimer , who had built the bomb .
The machine was actually used mainly for doing bomb calculations .
These were the prototype geeks , the nerds .
They didn &apos;t fit in at the Institute .
You can read the text .
This is hackers getting in trouble for the first time .
These were not theoretical physicists .
And it really was . It was the original microprocessor .
All the computers now are copies of that machine .
The input and the output was by teletype tape at first .
This is a wire drive , using bicycle wheels .
Then they switched to a magnetic drum .
And this is the beginning of computer graphics .
This includes a large amount of human error .
What &apos;s code , what &apos;s hardware ?
He had to focus the memory -- seems OK .
&quot; No use , went home . &quot;
Burning lots of midnight oil .
&quot; Found trouble in code , I hope . &quot;
&quot; Code error , machine not guilty . &quot;
&quot; A short -- do not turn the machine on . &quot;
So they really were working under tough conditions .
The high speed was 16 kilocycles .
&quot; I have now duplicated both results .
This now is the third different output .
I know when I &apos;m licked . &quot;
&quot; We &apos;ve duplicated errors before . &quot;
&quot; Machine run , fine . Code isn &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; Only happens when the machine is running . &quot;
And sometimes things are okay .
Trying to start an artificial genetic system running in the computer .
Began -- his universe started March 3 , &apos; 53 .
He had a wonderful rapport .
Even errors were duplicated .
So he designed this universe , and ran it .
It was published in the literature .
This is some of the generations of his universe .
They have to have something .
You have a genotype and you have to have a phenotype .
And they did start to evolve .
And he went around the country after that .
And he saw that evolution itself was an intelligent process .
It just was another version of the same thing happening .
And could you do it again now ?
And it was his universe on punch cards .
And the question is , should we run them or not ?
You know , could we get them running ?
Do you want to let it loose on the Internet ?
And that &apos;s what &apos;s happening !
It &apos;s a world that Von Neumann himself envisioned .
And we owe a tremendous credit to that .
And that &apos;s the end .
Thank you very much .
Don Norman : 3 ways good design makes you happy
The new me is beauty .
Well , I didn &apos;t have that in mind , so ...
This is neat .
Thank you for setting up my display .
I mean , it &apos;s just wonderful .
And that &apos;s my new life .
The acid will ruin the gold plating .
Beneath it is a wonderful knife .
It &apos;s a Global cutting knife made in Japan .
It &apos;s a delight to use .
And so it &apos;s got everything , right ?
It &apos;s beautiful and it &apos;s functional .
And those are the three components .
Is that a good way to play ping-pong ?
No . But is it fun ?
Yeah ! Yeah .
Or look at Google .
So Google just took their logo and they spread it out .
Instead of saying , &quot; You got 73,000 results .
It &apos;s really simple and subtle .
And it &apos;s just clever .
So , OK .
It was third .
Oh well , different story .
Buy it anyway .
It &apos;s so much fun to drive . &quot;
It &apos;s round , it &apos;s neat .
The controls work wonderfully .
I &apos;m going to put a plank on the ground .
No problem .
Intense fear paralyzes you .
It actually affects the way the brain works .
And I couldn &apos;t force myself across that .
Now some people can -- circus workers , steel workers .
But it really changes the way you think .
She brought students in to solve problems .
Would you tie those two strings together ? &quot;
Still can &apos;t reach it .
And , basically , none of them could solve it .
Would you like the box of candy ? &quot;
And guess what -- they solved the problem .
That &apos;s what brainstorming is about , right ?
You &apos;ve got be anxious .
No big deal .
Biology -- we have co-adapted through biology to like bright colors .
So that &apos;s the visceral level .
It &apos;s all about the visceral experience .
Visceral is subconscious , you &apos;re unaware of it .
Behavioral is subconscious , you &apos;re unaware of it .
Almost everything we do is subconscious .
Most of what we do is subconscious .
That &apos;s why the Global knives are so neat .
Or the sensual feeling .
It &apos;s a Ronnefeldt tilting teapot .
The water then seeps over the tea .
Emotion is all about acting ; emotion is really about acting .
It &apos;s being safe in the world .
It &apos;s kind of neat . What a wonderful design .
It looks over what &apos;s going on .
Here &apos;s a great reflective product .
But that &apos;s reflective design as well .
But it &apos;s ugly .
This is a clear Don Norman watch .
So , it &apos;s pitting one against the other .
The other neat thing ...
And that &apos;s what &apos;s nice about emotion .
So that &apos;s the new me .
I &apos;m only saying positive things from now on .
Renny Gleeson : Our antisocial phone tricks
So we &apos;ve developed certain tactics and strategies to cover up .
This first one &apos;s called &quot; the lean . &quot;
&quot; The stretch . &quot;
to get that device just below the tabletop .
Or , this one , coming to us from India .
That is actually the device .
Look around you .
This one I love .
This is the sound of one hand clapping .
People aren &apos;t simply projecting identity , they &apos;re creating it .
Thank you .
And then I &apos;ll draw the connection between these two behaviors .
Many of you have probably already noticed that I &apos;m Chinese .
I grew up in the Midwest of the United States .
You understood exactly what I just said in English .
I wouldn &apos;t have been able to convey so little information .
Actually , no .
It is the only Germanic language that requires this .
You speak English , a futured language .
Now this is a fanciful theory .
But how would you actually go about testing such a theory ?
This is a pocket of futureless language speakers in Northern Europe .
What is the average difference here ?
Five percentage points of your GDP saved per year .
Let me show you how far you can do that .
The survey takes over a day .
What are the characteristics we can control for ?
Does this have cumulative effects ?
Can we push this data even further ?
Well , think about smoking , for example .
Smoking is in some deep sense negative savings .
It &apos;s current pleasure in exchange for future pain .
What we should expect then is the opposite effect .
And that &apos;s exactly what we find .
Thank you very much .
Ken Robinson : Bring on the learning revolution !
Well , it &apos;s been downloaded four million times .
... don &apos;t you feel ?
And I referenced that at the end of my last talk .
So , as I was saying ...
You see , he &apos;s right .
Well , I do .
They simply go through their lives getting on with it .
They get no great pleasure from what they do .
And it &apos;s not true of enough people .
it &apos;s still true of a minority of people .
I think there are many possible explanations for it .
You have to create the circumstances where they show themselves .
This has to be transformed into something else .
One of the real challenges is to innovate fundamentally in education .
We don &apos;t teach American history in Britain .
We suppress it . You know , this is our policy .
I love that .
Not rise to it , rise with it .
I love that word , &quot; disenthrall . &quot;
You know what it means ?
Now , doing this is easier said than done .
And the reason is that you take it for granted .
So let me ask you something you may take for granted .
How many of you here are over the age of 25 ?
Are there any people here under the age of 25 ?
Ask a room full of teenagers the same thing .
Teenagers do not wear wristwatches .
They see no reason to do this .
She doesn &apos;t see the point .
&quot; Like , how lame is that ? &quot;
&quot; It has multiple functions . &quot;
Let me give you a couple of examples .
And probably the pinnacle for education is getting you to college .
I think we are obsessed with getting people to college .
Certain sorts of college .
Maybe they go later , not right away .
And I said , &quot; What do you do ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; I &apos;m a fireman . &quot;
This one teacher didn &apos;t take it seriously .
This linearity thing is a problem .
When I arrived in L.A.
No , it doesn &apos;t .
It doesn &apos;t .
Kindergarten begins in kindergarten .
They &apos;re three .
&quot; You &apos;ve achieved nothing -- commit .
The other big issue is conformity .
This is something Jamie Oliver talked about the other day .
You know there are two models of quality assurance in catering .
One is fast food , where everything is standardized .
I think we have to recognize a couple of things here .
One is that human talent is tremendously diverse .
People have very different aptitudes .
In a way , it did not for me .
It just wouldn &apos;t work .
But it &apos;s not only about that .
It &apos;s about passion .
So I think we have to change metaphors .
And you cannot predict the outcome of human development .
There are many great models .
That &apos;s where children experience life .
And I wanted to just very quickly ...
And we should tread softly .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Elizabeth Murchison : Fighting a contagious cancer
So first of all , what is a Tasmanian devil ?
A marsupial is a mammal with a pouch like a kangaroo .
At the time , this was thought to be a one-off .
Animals , just like humans , sometimes get strange tumors .
She hadn &apos;t eaten for days .
Her guts were swimming with parasitic worms .
Her body was riddled with secondary tumors .
Of course , they died along with the mother .
They were too young to survive without their mother .
Natural selection is survival of the fittest .
That &apos;s why cancer is such a difficult disease to treat .
It evolves .
The next slide is going to be gruesome .
This is Jonas .
I took these back to the lab .
I extracted DNA from them .
We found that all of these cancers shared the same DNA .
Think about that for a minute .
But how can a cancer spread in a population ?
So this Tasmanian devil cancer is perhaps the ultimate cancer .
Well the answer is , it has .
This is Kimbo .
And if you &apos;re squeamish , please look away now .
We also believe this cancer might be very old .
This cancer is remarkable .
It &apos;s the oldest mammalian-derived life form that we know of .
It &apos;s a living relic of the distant past .
So we &apos;ve seen that this can happen in animals .
Could cancers be contagious between people ?
What this tells us , ethical issues aside , is that ...
However , under some circumstances , it can happen .
My personal aim is to defeat the Tasmanian devil cancer .
Thank you .
Derek Paravicini and Adam Ockelford : In the key of genius
Music must be the thing for Derek .
That was the great eureka moment .
Derek Paravicini : I taught myself to play .
DP : &quot; Molly Malone . &quot;
AO : It wasn &apos;t actually &quot; Cockles and Mussels . &quot;
This one is &quot; English Country Garden . &quot;
DP : &quot; English Country Garden . &quot;
AO : There you are .
I think that &apos;s just fantastic .
Basically it was just an exciting journey , really .
But Derek , your ear is so much more than that .
Well , forget the terminology , Derek . Fantastic .
Now then .
So for example using your thumb under with C major .
Etc .
DP : No .
DP : This .
AO : Derek , let &apos;s have a bow .
Well done .
DP : &quot; Flight of the Bumblebee &quot; on that note .
AO : Or another one ? How about in G minor ?
DP : G minor .
AO : Fantastic . Well done , Derek .
Fantastic chap .
The other wonderful thing about you is memory .
So just be thoughtful before you suggest something too outlandish .
But seriously , would anyone like to choose a piece ?
Would you like to hear me play ?
AO : Well done .
DP : &quot; Chopsticks . &quot;
He &apos;s sitting there .
DP : Let Derek play it .
AO : What did you do with it , Derek ?
DP : I got to improvise with it , Adam .
AO : This is Derek the musician .
Keep up with Derek .
So this is one of Derek &apos;s heroes .
It &apos;s the great Art Tatum -- DP : Art Tatum .
DP : &quot; Tiger Rag . &quot;
Bjorn Lomborg : Global priorities bigger than climate change
So get out your pen and paper .
I &apos;m just going to list some of them .
There are 800 million people starving .
There &apos;s a billion people without clean drinking water .
Two billion people without sanitation .
There are several million people dying of HIV and AIDS .
The lists go on and on .
There are many , many problems out there .
We don &apos;t actually solve all problems .
And that &apos;s the question I &apos;d like to ask you .
Where should we start on solving these problems ?
But that &apos;s a wrong problem to ask .
Because we can &apos;t solve problems .
To climate change that would be like Kyoto .
What should be at the bottom of the list ?
And one reason is that prioritization is incredibly uncomfortable .
Nobody wants to do this .
We have not had an idea .
We &apos;d like to know these things .
Likewise in communicable diseases .
What would be the price ?
And so on .
We called them the &quot; dream team . &quot;
And then you ask , why economists ?
That is what economists do .
They prioritize .
These were the bad projects .
Why is it it came up ?
It &apos;s not saying that global warming is not happening .
It &apos;s not saying that it &apos;s not a big problem .
That &apos;s a substantial amount of money .
Yet it would do very little good .
Which is a little good , but not very much good .
Or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good ?
And that is really why it becomes a bad project .
The fourth best problem is malaria -- dealing with malaria .
This third best one was free trade .
That would be the third best thing we could do .
The second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition .
That would be the second best investment that we could do .
One is treatment ; the other one is prevention .
And treatment is much , much more expensive than prevention .
But of course , we don &apos;t do all problems .
There are many problems out there in the world .
Even the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the U.N.
And of course , we &apos;ll be even richer than that .
We &apos;re actually talking about a fairly rich Dutch guy .
It just doesn &apos;t make for as much of a movie .
Since then our aid has halved .
I &apos;m all for that .
The majority of them were , first , from developing countries .
We &apos;ve done this many other times .
They all come out with very much the same list .
I see the Copenhagen Consensus as a process .
Thank you .
Bill Gates : Mosquitos , malaria and education
Any tough problem , I think it can be solved .
Over the past century , average lifespan has more than doubled .
It &apos;s a phenomenal thing .
Each one of those lives matters a lot .
So we really can make changes .
And I think that &apos;s doable in well under 20 years .
Well , what &apos;s the history of this disease ?
It &apos;s been a severe disease for thousands of years .
So it was absolutely gigantic .
And the disease was all over the world .
So it was everywhere .
And two tools helped bring the death rate down .
One was killing the mosquitos with DDT .
And so that &apos;s why the death rate did come down .
So we can see : 1900 , it &apos;s everywhere .
1945 , it &apos;s still most places .
1990 , you &apos;ve gotten most of the northern areas .
Now , baldness , it &apos;s a terrible thing .
And rich men are afflicted .
And so that &apos;s why that priority has been set .
Now , malaria is of course transmitted by mosquitos .
I brought some here , just so you could experience this .
We &apos;ll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit .
There &apos;s no reason only poor people should have the experience .
Those mosquitos are not infected .
And bed nets are a great tool .
And that &apos;s happened now in a number of countries .
It &apos;s great to see .
And so you end up with two choices .
And that &apos;s where we saw the malaria map shrinking .
Now we &apos;re on the upswing .
Bed net funding is up .
There &apos;s new drug discovery going on .
So we &apos;re going to have these new tools .
But that alone doesn &apos;t give us the road map .
Of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise .
And this is : How do you make a teacher great ?
And the answer is , really , that we don &apos;t .
Let &apos;s start with why this is important .
We all had a wonderful education .
I had great teachers .
There are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places .
Not only has that been weak. it &apos;s getting weaker .
And we have to change this .
We have to change it so that people have equal opportunity .
Over 30 percent of kids never finish high school .
Because they weren &apos;t tracking where the kids were before that .
But most of the dropouts had taken place before that .
For minority kids , it &apos;s over 50 percent .
And that doesn &apos;t seem entirely fair .
So , how do you make education better ?
There &apos;s many people working on it .
A lot of these things had a good effect .
How much variation is there within a school or between schools ?
And the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable .
What does that mean ?
We should retain those people .
But I can tell you that absolutely is not happening today .
What are the characteristics of this top quartile ?
What do they look like ?
You might think these must be very senior teachers .
And the answer is no .
The variation is very , very small .
You might think these are people with master &apos;s degrees .
One is seniority .
Because your pay goes up and you vest into your pension .
Teach for America : slight effect .
For math teachers majoring in math there &apos;s a measurable effect .
But , overwhelmingly , it &apos;s your past performance .
There are some people who are very good at this .
And it &apos;s a system with very high turnover .
KIPP means Knowledge Is Power .
It &apos;s an unbelievable thing .
They &apos;re team teaching . They &apos;re constantly improving their teachers .
They &apos;re deeply engaged in making teaching better .
What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
Everybody needs to be involved .
And so KIPP is doing it .
How does that compare to a normal school ?
The data isn &apos;t gathered .
And they need advanced notice to do that .
And so that &apos;s sort of working in the opposite direction .
Of course , digital video is cheap now .
And they could all sit and work together on those problems .
And I thought it was so fantastic .
It gave you a sense of what a good teacher does .
But I -- I &apos;m optimistic .
I only had time to frame those two problems .
You know , the system doesn &apos;t naturally make it happen .
Governments don &apos;t naturally pick these things in the right way .
Thank you .
Suheir Hammad : Poems of war , peace , women , power
I will not dance to that beating .
I know that beat .
It is lifeless .
I know intimately that skin you are hitting .
It was alive once , hunted , stolen , stretched .
I will not dance to your drummed-up war .
I will not pop , spin , break for you .
I will not hate for you or even hate you .
I will not kill for you .
Especially I will not die for you .
I will not mourn the dead with murder nor suicide .
Everyone can be wrong .
Life is a right , not collateral or casual .
I will not forget where I come from .
I will craft my own drum .
Gather my beloved near , and our chanting will be dancing .
Our humming will be drumming .
I will not be played .
I will dance and resist and dance and persist and dance .
This heartbeat is louder than death .
Your war drum ain &apos;t louder than this breath . Haaa .
A bunch of pacifists .
Confused , aspiring pacifists .
I understand .
I &apos;ve been wrong a lot lately .
Like a lot .
So I couldn &apos;t figure out what to read today .
I mean , I &apos;ve been saying I &apos;ve been prepping .
Poetry does that .
It preps you . It aims you .
Hold her now with you .
Are you holding her ?
This is &quot; Break Clustered . &quot;
All holy history banned .
Unwritten books predicted the future , projected the past .
Whose son shall it be ?
Which male child will perish a new day ?
Our boys &apos; deaths galvanize .
We cherish corpses .
We mourn women , complicated .
Bitches get beat daily .
Profits made , prophets ignored .
War and tooth , enameled salted lemon childhoods .
All colors run , none of us solid .
I live cycles of light and darkness .
Rhythm is half silence .
Sickness , health , tender violence .
I think now I never was pure .
Human contracted itself blind , malignant .
I never was pure .
Girl spoiled before ripened .
Language can &apos;t math me .
I experience exponentially .
Everything is everything .
One woman loses six .
One woman loses her head .
One woman searches rubble . One woman feeds on trash .
One woman shoots her face . One woman shoots her husband .
One woman straps herself .
One woman gives birth to a baby .
One woman gives birth to borders .
One woman no longer believes love will ever find her .
One woman never did .
Where do refugee hearts go ?
Faced with absence .
We mourn each one or we mean nothing at all .
My spine curves spiral .
Precipice running to and running from human beings .
Cluster bombs left behind .
De facto landmines .
A smoldering grief .
Harvest contaminated tobacco .
Harvest bombs .
Harvest baby teeth .
Harvest palms , smoke .
Harvest witness , smoke .
Resolutions , smoke .
Salvation , smoke .
Redemption , smoke .
Breathe .
Do not fear what has blown up .
If you must , fear the unexploded .
Thank you .
Saul Griffith : High-altitude wind energy from kites !
But kites aren &apos;t just toys like this .
So they knew at that stage they could carry large weights .
And that was fantastic for the future of commercial aviation .
So this is the dawn of the new age of kites .
It makes you a little nauseous .
And this is where we &apos;re actually going .
So we &apos;re beyond the 12-second steps .
So you ask , how big are those machines ?
Well , this paper plane would be maybe a -- oop !
That would be enough to power your cell phone .
Your Cessna would be 230 killowatts .
And the Spruce Goose would be a 15-megawatt wing .
So that is audacious , you say . I agree .
But audacious is what has happened many times before in history .
By 1945 , they were making 100,000 .
I am lucky enough to work with 30 of them .
Thank you .
Matthieu Ricard : The habits of happiness
There &apos;s the Mount Kailash in Eastern Tibet -- wonderful setting .
This is from Marlboro country .
This is a turquoise lake .
A meditator .
They said , &quot; Yes , but it &apos;s summertime . &quot;
So now , we are going to speak of happiness .
We like the ups and downs of life .
Now , let &apos;s come to happiness or well-being .
And that can also come from some kind of confusions .
One of the most common ones is happiness and pleasure .
It is something that -- changes of nature .
That &apos;s the nature of things . We get tired .
I can hear it two , three , five times .
It sort of uses itself as you experience it .
Now , what , then , will be happiness ?
For you , that might be surprising .
Because we are speaking of a different level .
Look at the waves coming here to shore .
You hit the solid rock .
So now , how is that ?
Even joy -- that can be the spring of happiness .
That very sentence already reveals the doom of destruction of happiness .
To have everything . If we miss something , it collapses .
And isn &apos;t that stronger ?
The experience that translates everything is within the mind .
So then , this just needs to have some experience .
There are some which are adverse to this well-being .
And also , they are detrimental to others &apos; happiness .
And we would like to be like that all the time .
You can have ugly faces , beautiful faces in the mirror .
That is the ground for mind training .
You could go from love to hate .
Benevolence , loving kindness against hatred .
So then , it &apos;s a self-perpetuating process .
Look at anger itself .
So this is the principal of mind training .
But that &apos;s the only way to go .
Mind transformation -- that is the very meaning of meditation .
So can we do that with human qualities ?
With loving kindness , with patience , with openness ?
So that &apos;s what those great meditators have been doing .
They are real Olympic champions of mind training .
Now , here with 256 electrodes .
So what did they find ? Of course , same thing .
It deals with the state of compassion , unconditional compassion .
It &apos;s something that is totally out of the bell curve .
Hopefully , they will come .
Like the startle experiments , for example .
This is not a supplementary vitamin for the soul .
We are ready to spend 15 years achieving education .
We love to do jogging , fitness .
We do all kinds of things to remain beautiful .
Now , our compassion is supposed to be put in action .
That &apos;s what we try to do in different places .
Just this one example is worth a lot of work .
One year later , how she is .
Different schools and clinics we &apos;ve been doing in Tibet .
And jumping monks of Tibet .
Flying monks .
Thank you very much .
Ariel Garten : Know thyself , with a brain scanner
&quot; Know thyself . &quot;
&quot; Know thyself . &quot;
I &apos;ve always been fascinated with knowing the self .
We &apos;ve cluttered ourselves up with all this .
It &apos;s really only a successful escape .
Think of the term we use , &quot; Retreat . &quot;
It means we &apos;ve got to get out of here .
And eventually that vacation &apos;s got to come to an end .
I say the answer is yes .
It &apos;s called thought-controlled computing .
Let me show you what it looks like .
That blue line there is my brainwave .
You &apos;re actually looking inside my head as I speak .
We were transcending the space between the mind and the device .
So controlling stuff with your mind is pretty cool .
But we &apos;re always interested in multi-tiered levels of human interaction .
And that was responsiveness .
And it could join into the relationship with you .
They followed these little shifts in your mental activity .
When you read , the desk lamp would get brighter .
That you could know something about yourself .
Here &apos;s an application that I created for the iPad .
So you use it with your headset .
The headset connects wirelessly to an iPad or a smartphone .
As you focus on the wooden form , it rotates .
The more you focus , the faster the rotation .
This is for real .
This is not a fake .
I like to call this &quot; intra-active . &quot;
Normally we think about technology as interactive .
This technology is intra-active .
So you can create applications that reward focused brain states .
This can be as effective as Ritalin .
It would be like plugging into your own personal Google .
Would you get a divorce ?
Two millennia ago , those Greeks had some powerful insights .
One moment it was all white space , pure possibility .
Thank you .
Graham Hill : Less stuff , more happiness
What &apos;s in the box ?
Sound familiar ?
Three times .
Nope .
So where does this lead ?
It &apos;s actually a great way to save you some money .
By buying a space that was 420 sq. ft .
instead of 600 , immediately I &apos;m saving 200 grand .
So how can you live little ?
Three main approaches .
First of all , you have to edit ruthlessly .
We &apos;ve got to clear the arteries of our lives .
And that shirt that I hadn &apos;t worn in years ?
It &apos;s time for me to let it go .
We need to think before we buy .
Secondly , our new mantra : small is sexy .
We want space efficiency .
Why have a six burner stove when you rarely use three ?
My office folds away , easily hidden .
My bed just pops out of the wall with two fingers .
And of course , my own movie theater .
But consider the benefits of an edited life .
Go from 3,000 to 2,000 , from 1,500 to 1,000 .
Would that give me a little more freedom ?
Maybe a little more time ? &quot;
What &apos;s in the box ?
It doesn &apos;t really matter .
I know I don &apos;t need it .
What &apos;s in yours ?
Maybe , just maybe , less might equal more .
So let &apos;s make room for the good stuff .
Thank you .
Hans Rosling : Asia &apos;s rise -- how and when
And that changed my mindset forever .
You see , I was a study nerd .
I loved statistics from a young age .
And I studied very much in Sweden .
In Sweden we read it once and then we went partying .
But I will start with a historical background .
I will start at 1858 .
1858 was a year of great technological advancement in the West .
And they were the first to &quot; Twitter &quot; transatlantically .
Because 1858 was also watershed year in the history of Asia .
And India was up to 89 years more of foreign domination .
It meant paying with opium for Chinese goods .
And let &apos;s see how much difference that can make .
The size of the bubble here is the population .
And I also bring an innovation here .
And we will see , you know .
And I will start the world like this .
India was not always like this level .
India was trying down here .
Can you see how it starts to move there ?
But really , really natural sovereignty was good for Japan .
And Japan is trying to move up there .
But careful now -- we are approaching the First World War .
United Kingdom is going down .
And now comes the Spanish flu also .
And then after the First World War , they continue up .
Not much has happened .
They have grown their population but not much more .
But they did recover quite fast afterwards .
And we are moving into the new world .
In 1947 India finally gained its independence .
And what happened ?
What happens in the after independence ?
You can see that the health started to improve .
Children started to go to school .
Health services were provided .
This is the Great Leap Forward , when China fell down .
It was central planning by Mao Tse Tung .
And they were catching up indeed .
And it was Deng Xiaoping coming out here .
Because catching mice is what the two cats wanted to do .
And the market reformer was successful there .
In &apos; 92 India follows with a market reform .
And here they march on . And will they catch up ?
This is the big question today .
There they are today .
Shanghai is already there .
And it &apos;s healthier than the United States .
The geographical , macro-geographical difference is not so big .
And here , Maharashtra , with Mumbai , is forging forward .
And that is not a bad thing , in itself .
Oh , they broke my frame .
Washington , D.C. went out here .
And I can understand him , because Washington , D.C.
It &apos;s quite interesting , isn &apos;t it ?
We have an enormous disparity in the world .
Now , back to my projections .
And then time here , from 1858 I start the world .
And we shall see what will happen with these countries .
Whereas U.K. and United States is getting richer and richer .
And after Second World War , United States is richer than U.K.
But independence is coming here .
Growth is starting , economic reform .
Look at , look at the United States .
Can you see the bubble ?
The bubbles , not my bubbles , but the financial bubbles .
You see it came down there .
And people interested in growth are turning their eyes towards Asia .
I can compare to Japan . This is Japan coming up .
You see , Japan did it like that .
We add Japan to it .
Can you see here what Japan did ?
Can be worse , can be better .
It &apos;s always difficult to predict , especially about the future .
I think I &apos;m in a difficult position here .
But what I &apos;m really worried about is war .
The 27th of July , 2048 is my 100th birthday .
Get your bookings in time . Thank you very much .
Carl Schoonover : How to look inside the brain
This is a thousand-year-old drawing of the brain .
It &apos;s a diagram of the visual system .
And some things look very familiar today .
You really would be kind of out of luck .
Nobody had had a glimpse of the brain &apos;s wiring .
It &apos;s gray , formless .
There &apos;s no structure . It won &apos;t tell you anything .
And this all changed in the late 19th century .
The computer was cracked open .
And it works in a very particular way .
It clears the forest , reveals the trees inside .
If everything had been labeled , nothing would have been visible .
So somehow it shows what &apos;s there .
And there &apos;s several ways of doing this .
But one of the most popular ones involves green fluorescent protein .
They have great explanatory power .
Thank you .
Lian Pin Koh : A drone &apos;s-eye view of conservation
So what is a drone ?
So what can we do with a conservation drone ?
But nests are not the only objects these drones can detect .
This is an oil palm plantation in Sumatra .
This is a recently logged forest , again in Sumatra .
Recently , we &apos;ve also begun experimenting with thermal imaging cameras .
We built our first prototype drones in Switzerland .
Building drones for us is a constant work in progress .
Radio collars are another tool that &apos;s commonly used by biologists .
Now these collars are put onto animals .
The MAJA drone has a wingspan of about two meters .
It is a fully autonomous system .
That is quite sufficient for most of our conservation applications .
And in a way , they are right .
Thank you .
Anthony Atala : Printing a human kidney
The fact is that we &apos;re living longer .
So this is now a public health crisis .
It really involves many different areas .
Or we can use both .
We can use , actually , biomaterials and the cells together .
And that &apos;s where the field is today .
But it &apos;s actually not a new field .
It &apos;s titled &quot; The Culture of Organs . &quot;
The first author , Alexis Carrel , a Nobel Prize winner .
But I want you to note his co-author : Charles Lindbergh .
And that really has to do to many different challenges .
And many advances now , we can do that fairly readily .
The second challenge was cells .
Over the last 20 years , we &apos;ve basically tackled that .
Many scientists can now grow many different types of cells .
Plus we have stem cells .
So we can actually use biomaterials now .
This is actually a biomaterial .
This is actually like a cotton candy machine .
You saw the spray going in .
And that &apos;s exactly what we did here .
We can also use cells alone .
These are actually cells that we obtained .
So they know what to do .
So that &apos;s actually now in patients .
Another technology that we have used in patients actually involves bladders .
We then put it in this oven-like device .
For these specific patients , we actually just suture these materials .
Another technology that we &apos;ve used is actually that of printing .
And then finally you &apos;re able to get that structure out .
That was all new bone that was implanted using these techniques .
That &apos;s what you see here on the right side .
This is how it actually works .
Here &apos;s the scanner going through , scanning the wound .
And this is actually new technology still under development .
We &apos;re also working on more sophisticated printers .
Because in reality , our biggest challenge are the solid organs .
This actually shows the actual printer .
And this actually shows that printing .
In fact , we actually have the printer right here .
Put a pair of gloves here .
Thank you .
Go backwards .
Has a little bit of consistency to it .
Thank you , Dr. Kang . I appreciate it .
So this is actually a new generation .
This is actually the printer that you see here onstage .
I was missing school . It was pretty much miserable .
I felt so sick .
I was able to do more things .
I was able to wrestle in high school .
I was able to be a normal kid with my friends .
Luke , come up please .
JE : And Tony &apos;s done hundreds of these ?
I pulled them aside .
Thank you so much .
JE : Thank you , Tony .
Tom Shannon , John Hockenberry : The painter and the pendulum
And I did one that was about 35 feet long .
JH : Is there a relief in playing with these forces ?
TS : Those are permanent magnets , yeah .
TS : Yeah .
It &apos;s really unsatisfactory having plug-in art .
JH : I agree .
My sculptures are normally very simplified .
I try to refine them down to very simple forms .
JH : And they &apos;re non-deterministic .
TS : No .
But then I started dreaming of having six colors .
JH : It looks like we &apos;re loaded for bear here .
JH : Thanks guys .
JH : Whoa . That is ...
ooh , nice .
TS : So something like this .
JH : That &apos;s fantastic .
JH : So many forces there .
Like the occurrence of moire patterns .
TS : It is the paint actually , makes it real .
It &apos;s really manifested there .
There are lots of things that appear .
So I think , conceivably , those could be predictive .
Is that relevant to your work ?
I mean , I &apos;ve got the symptoms .
I &apos;m left-handed , and so I draw .
JH : So you &apos;re not a gatekeeper for these forces .
You think of yourself as the servant .
TS : Nature is -- well , it &apos;s a godsend .
It just has so much in it .
And we are expressions of the universe , basically .
It &apos;s a terrific studio assistant .
TS : Thank you , John .
Moshe Safdie : How to reinvent the apartment building
We traveled the country .
Those who have no choice lived there .
There has to be another way of doing this .
It &apos;s a very desirable place to live in .
In 1973 , I made my first trip to China .
It was the Cultural Revolution .
We traveled the country , met with architects and planners .
Shenzhen didn &apos;t even exist as a city .
There were hardly any cars .
Thirty years later , this is Beijing today .
This is Hong Kong .
Could we make it more affordable ?
And we mapped all the building area in Manhattan .
It &apos;s permeable .
And most important , permeable , open .
That &apos;s measured in the winter solstice .
And Colombo .
And that &apos;s all I can tell you in five minutes .
Thank you .
Siegfried Woldhek : The search for the true face of Leonardo
Good morning .
But we do not know his face .
Even this well-known portrait is not accepted by many art historians .
So , what do you think ?
Let &apos;s find out .
Leonardo was a man that drew everything around him .
But no faces ?
I find that hard to believe .
So let &apos;s try to find them .
There are about 120 , you see them here .
Which ones of these could be self-portraits ?
So we can eliminate all the profiles .
It also has to be sufficiently detailed .
So we can also eliminate the ugly ones or the caricatures .
And here they are .
So I know a little about drawing and analyzing faces .
OK , now let &apos;s look at these three portraits .
I couldn &apos;t believe my eyes when I first saw that .
There is no reason why these portraits should look alike .
Now , are they made in the right order ?
The young man should be made first .
They are made in the right order .
Well , we need a reference .
Ladies and gentlemen , this story has not yet been published .
The icon of icons finally has a face .
Here he is : Leonardo da Vinci .
Eric Dishman : Health care should be a team sport
They don &apos;t know anything about you . Wake up .
And I did .
It &apos;s unaffordable globally .
We need to invent what I call a personal health system .
This is the kidney transplant I was never supposed to have .
Don &apos;t you in the front row worry or anything .
This is a portable ultrasound .
All right , I gotta gel up .
Now the people in the front row are very nervous .
And actually , can you see Libby ?
Thomas Batuik : Hi there , Eric .
You look busy . How are you ?
Should I do that again ?
TB : Yeah , let &apos;s do that .
It &apos;s not something I was very happy about .
So let &apos;s start with care anywhere .
This was me in third grade .
Recovering from the surgery in the hospital , I get bedsores .
Now the software is also getting smarter , right ?
And I have these palpitations that are showing up .
I had a care coordination problem .
And this happens to millions of people every year .
Now this is the most frightening thing to me .
And this is a picture of my graduation team from Legacy .
I wept the day I graduated .
And here &apos;s the most important part .
That &apos;s the only way that the model works .
And I think that &apos;s why I achieved longevity .
Tracey Gamley : For me , it was really easy .
I only had one night in the hospital .
Dennis Hong : My seven species of robot
So , the first robot to talk about is called STriDER .
It stands for Self-excited Tripedal Dynamic Experimental Robot .
But before that , let &apos;s look at pop culture .
But my robot , STriDER , does not move like this .
So , this is an actual dynamic simulation animation .
I &apos;m just going to show you how the robot works .
We call that the concept of passive dynamic locomotion .
potential energy to kinetic energy , potential energy to kinetic energy .
It &apos;s a constantly falling process .
So we have two prototypes .
The first version , in the back , that &apos;s STriDER I.
The one in front , the smaller , is STriDER II .
The second robot I want to talk about is called IMPASS .
It stands for Intelligent Mobility Platform with Actuated Spoke System .
So , it &apos;s a wheel-leg hybrid robot .
We are literally re-inventing the wheel here .
Let me demonstrate how it works .
You probably haven &apos;t seen anything like this out there .
Ah , isn &apos;t that cool ?
The front wheels rotate like this .
We just simply change the length of the spoke .
But the current rovers cannot get there .
So , this is CLIMBeR .
Also for search and rescue applications as well .
And they already had a six legged robot called LEMUR .
We developed our adaptive gait planner .
We actually have a very interesting payload on there .
We get so many visitors visiting our lab .
Welcome to RoMeLa , the Robotics Mechanisms Laboratory at Virginia Tech .
This robot is an amoeba robot .
So , this is some of the early feasibility experiments .
Robotic Air Powered Hand with Elastic Ligaments .
We developed these novel actuators for joints .
And it can actually crush an empty soda can .
This is a robot that can climb structures .
This is a HyDRAS &apos;s arm .
It &apos;s a 12 degrees of freedom robotic arm .
But the cool part is the user interface .
The cable over there , that &apos;s an optical fiber .
Now , this robot is currently our star robot .
So , this does not have any sensors .
So , it &apos;s an open loop control .
And thus , DARwIn I was born in 2005 .
It stands up , it walks -- very impressive .
And now DARwIn II is completely autonomous .
It is not remote controlled .
It &apos;s an international autonomous robot soccer competition .
So , this is last year in China .
This is this year in Austria .
There you go . Yes !
The robots track and they team play amongst themselves .
Louis Vuitton Cup trophy .
Thank you .
DARwIn also has a lot of other talents .
And it walks away . So , this is DARwIn IV .
So , what is the secret of our success ?
Where do we come up with these ideas ?
How do we develop these kinds of ideas ?
We call it the Blind Driver Challenge , very exciting .
So , really , we have five secrets .
First is : Where do we get inspiration ?
Where do we get this spark of imagination ?
This is a true story , my personal story .
And they assemble , and they form these kinds of mechanisms .
And then I think , &quot; Ah this is cool . &quot;
So , I need to decipher what I wrote .
But just a spark of imagination is not good enough .
How do we develop these kinds of ideas ?
But before we start we set this golden rule .
The rule is : Nobody criticizes anybody &apos;s ideas .
Nobody criticizes any opinion .
And this is how we develop our ideas .
He gave a talk about how education and school kills creativity .
Well , actually , there are two sides to the story .
Math , differential equations .
These are all the tools that we need .
So , education is very important .
There you go . Thank you so much .
Mikko Hypponen : Fighting viruses , defending the net
I love the Internet .
It &apos;s true .
Think about everything it has brought us .
And it &apos;s happening during our lifetimes .
I &apos;ve spent my career fighting these problems .
So let me show you something .
This here is Brain .
It &apos;s the first virus we ever found for PC computers .
And we actually know where Brain came from .
We know because it says so inside the code .
Let &apos;s take a look .
All right .
And Basit and Amjad are first names , Pakistani first names .
Now , 1986 .
Now it &apos;s 2011 .
That &apos;s 25 years ago .
The PC virus problem is 25 years old now .
Here &apos;s a typical street view .
And I knocked on the door .
You want to guess who opened the door ?
Basit and Amjad ; they are still there .
So here standing up is Basit .
Sitting down is his brother Amjad .
These are the guys who wrote the first PC virus .
Now of course , we had a very interesting discussion .
I asked them why .
I asked them how they feel about what they started .
So let me just mount some drives . Go over there .
What we have here is a list of old viruses .
So let me just run some viruses on my computer .
For example , let &apos;s go with the Centipede virus first .
You know that you &apos;re infected because it actually shows up .
Let me show you one which actually makes some sound .
And the last example , guess what the Walker virus does ?
Today , viruses are a global problem .
And if we just scroll around , it &apos;s just massive .
We find tens of thousands , even hundreds of thousands .
So where are all these coming from then ?
It &apos;s gangs like -- let &apos;s go to GangstaBucks.com.
And they &apos;ll actually pay you money for those computers .
So how do these guys then monetize those infected computers ?
Same thing with every single password and so on .
And that , obviously , is a problem .
They are both right now on the run .
Nobody knows where they are .
So the amount of money online crime generates is significant .
They also use the global nature of Internet to their advantage .
I mean , the Internet is international .
That &apos;s why we call it the Internet .
So you just can &apos;t shut these guys down .
So how do you actually go around finding online criminals ?
How do you actually track them down ?
Let me give you an example .
What we have here is one exploit file .
It has been encrypted with XOR function 97 .
And we can go here and actually start decrypting it .
Well the yellow part of the code is now decrypted .
But just keep staring at it .
And that &apos;s a backdoor which will take over your computer .
It &apos;s not used for anything .
So obviously I Googled for it .
I got zero hits ; wasn &apos;t there .
So I spoke with the guys at the lab .
And he drives a very nice car .
How do I know about this car ?
Because he blogged about the car .
He actually had a car accident .
So what happens when online criminals are caught ?
Well in most cases it never gets this far .
I wish it would be easier ; unfortunately it isn &apos;t .
But things are also changing at a very rapid pace .
You &apos;ve all heard about things like Stuxnet .
And this is what runs our infrastructure .
This is what runs everything around us .
Because everything around us is being run by these .
I mean , we have critical infrastructure .
Everything is being run by computers .
Everything is reliant on these computers working .
Think about all the services we have online .
That &apos;s much more important than running anti-viruses or running firewalls .
Thank you very much .
Rogier van der Heide : Why light needs darkness
Well that was not by me .
So this is how we normally would light our offices .
The sun is for dynamics , for color changes .
So in an indirect way , you can see the sun .
They allowed themselves a few mistakes along the way .
They are in green energy consulting , or something like that .
I really owe a short introduction of this man to you .
So you begin with focal glow .
Ambient luminescence is something very different .
And we can only create these out of darkness .
And I will explain that further .
And you can imagine a lot more applications .
And it is all about this planet .
Because all this light here goes up to the sky .
It never reaches the ground where it was meant for .
It never is to the benefit of people .
It only spoils the darkness .
So at a global scale , it looks like this .
How do they share their culture ?
How do we tackle things like mobility ?
And how can light help there ?
So here it is .
And I will very quickly show you how it works .
So just to explain .
Now this is not very pleasant and comfortable .
So you can preserve the darkness and make the light .
Thank you .
We can go further .
So we have to rethink the way we light our cities .
We have to think again about light as a default solution .
Why are all these motorways permanently lit ?
Is it really needed ?
Can we be more gentle with light ?
Like here -- this is a very low light level actually .
And can we preserve the darkness ?
They are not disturbed anymore .
Where have they come from ? Where are they going ?
We can do that in commercial spaces like this .
In architecture , it works just the same .
It wouldn &apos;t be such an inspiring scenography without this theater .
Thank you very much .
Eva Zeisel : The playful search for beauty
And I am illustrating Still .
So this takes care of my age .
This was about 1925 .
All of these things were made during the last 75 years .
This was an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art .
This is now for sale at the Metropolitan Museum .
This is still at the Metropolitan Museum now for sale .
This is a portrait of my daughter and myself .
These were just some of the things I &apos;ve made .
I made hundreds of them for the last 75 years .
I call myself a maker of things .
Industrial designers want to make novel things .
Novelty is a concept of commerce , not an aesthetic concept .
Innovation is not part of the aim of my work .
Let me tell you some about my life .
The work as an apprentice was very primitive .
And then finally it was prepared for the throwing .
And there I really worked as an apprentice .
I said , I also have a pottery .
I remember that it was quite successful .
And that was in Hamburg .
This was my first job .
Eva Zeisel : Are you sure ?
Moderator : Yes , I am sure .
This was a very dangerous accusation .
Weren &apos;t you there recently ?
Bonnie Bassler : How bacteria &quot; talk &quot;
Bacteria are the oldest living organisms on the earth .
You have about 30,000 genes .
We &apos;re not doing anything to the cells here .
This is now supposed to be my bacterial cell .
When it &apos;s alone it doesn &apos;t make any light .
This is like the stealth bomber of the ocean .
Bacteria always control pathogenicity with quorum sensing .
That &apos;s how it works .
This is the Vibrio fischeri molecule .
This is the word that it talks with .
Each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other .
So these are private , secret conversations .
These conversations are for intraspecies communication .
It &apos;s a very small , five-carbon molecule .
So they &apos;re all using this molecule for interspecies communication .
This is the bacterial Esperanto .
Couldn &apos;t these be new kinds of antibiotics ?
The first one is we &apos;ve targeted the intraspecies communication system .
We &apos;ve also done the same thing with the pink system .
To finish I &apos;ll just show you the strategy .
We think bacteria made the rules for how multicellular organization works .
This is exactly what happens in your body .
Science is done by that demographic .
It &apos;s a really lucky demographic to work with .
I want to thank you for inviting me here .
Thanks .
Richard Baraniuk : The birth of the open-source learning revolution
I &apos;m Rich Baraniuk .
Does anybody remember these ?
Today &apos;s hit single is not last year &apos;s hit single .
But , I &apos;m not here to talk about music today .
I &apos;m here to talk about books .
Has anyone here ever been to school ?
So , imagine taking all the world &apos;s books .
Think of it as a massive iTunes for book type content .
In fact , this dream is actually being realized .
We &apos;re working on the open-source tools and the content .
Her material is now used over 600,000 times per month .
Tremendous , tremendous use .
What about copying , reusing , right ?
A little present for you .
It &apos;s about 300 pages long , hardbound .
This costs , anybody guess ?
How much would it cost in a bookstore ?
Audience : 65 dollars .
Richard Baraniuk : This costs 22 dollars to the student .
Why does it cost 22 dollars ?
We &apos;re talking about books on hyper geometric partial differential equations .
OK , so what are the enablers ?
What &apos;s really making all of this happen ?
How many people know about XML ?
Remember we took the book , tore the pages out ?
So imagine your kid &apos;s algebra textbook in seventh grade .
The same type of mark-up , like mathML , for chemistry .
Even the three wise men .
We can &apos;t let this Napster thing happen here .
And the ideas , the creative commons licenses .
How many people have heard of creative commons ?
If you have not , you must learn about it . Creativecommons.org.
We &apos;re not talking about Harry Potter , right ?
We &apos;re at the long tail end here .
How do we protect it into the future ?
So that could be a problem .
Connexions and open content is all about sharing knowledge .
So , thanks very much .
Sam Martin : Claim your &quot; manspace &quot;
It had everything I needed . It was quiet .
So I did some research .
And I found that there was an historic precedence .
Hemingway had his writing space .
But on the inside , it &apos;s anything but .
And this , to me , is a pretty classic manspace .
And he found the scoreboard in the trash .
Here &apos;s another outdoor space , a little bit more sophisticated .
The guy did it all himself .
And there is about 1,000 square feet of hanging-out space inside .
There were definitely hang-out spots .
Take this place for example .
On the outside it looks like a typical northeastern garage .
This is in Long Island , New York .
It has no nails or screws .
All the joints are hand-carved and hand-scribed .
And so there is a good reason for this .
It was built by this man who is Wayne McCullough .
Museum quality .
And they were unexpected and they were surprising .
And they really loved their professions .
And they were very passionate about their collections and their hobbies .
Thank you very much .
Stefon Harris : There are no mistakes on the bandstand
It is really a sacred space .
You really are alive right here in this moment .
But that could have happened -- maybe , maybe not .
Everyone &apos;s listening . We &apos;re responding .
You have no time for projected ideas .
Every &quot; mistake &quot; is an opportunity in jazz .
So if Christian played a note -- like play an F.
See , these are all right inside of the color palette .
If you played an E.
And we &apos;re going to play on this palette .
And at some point , Christian will introduce this note .
And we won &apos;t react to it .
We &apos;ll see what happens when we play with this palette .
So someone could conceptually perceive that as a mistake .
It was an opportunity that was missed .
So it &apos;s unpredictable . We &apos;ll paint this palette again .
We &apos;ll all accept his ideas , or not .
So you see , he played this note .
I ended up creating a melody out of it .
The texture changed in the drums this time .
So there is no mistake .
So jazz , this bandstand is absolutely amazing .
It &apos;s a very purifying experience .
So how does this all relate to behavioral finance ?
You have some people who do .
But what that does is it actually limits the artistic possibilities .
ready , just play some time .
One , two , one , two , three , four .
It &apos;s kind of chaotic because I &apos;m bullying my ideas .
This is a science of listening .
Totally different experience when I &apos;m pulling ideas .
It &apos;s much more organic . It &apos;s much more nuanced .
It &apos;s not about bullying my vision or anything like that .
Thank you .
One is the Thylacine Project .
We &apos;ve lost a whole family .
That &apos;s a big chunk of the global genome gone .
I &apos;d like it back .
The second reason is that we killed these things .
Okay . Let me talk to you about the Lazarus Project .
It &apos;s a frog . And you think , frog .
Yeah , but this was not just any frog .
Now , when biologists saw this , they were agog .
They thought , this is incredible .
And just as everybody got excited about it , bang !
It was extinct .
Well , we looked at the tissue under the microscope .
So we thought , let &apos;s give it a go .
What we did is something called somatic cell nuclear transplantation .
We used ultraviolet radiation to do that .
That was a miracle , but it was workable .
That was so exciting . And then the egg divided again .
So we &apos;re very excited . This is not a tadpole .
Thank you .
But it &apos;s not related to any of those .
But it &apos;s also a tragic history .
In those fossil rocks are some amazing animals .
We found marsupial lions .
We found carnivorous kangaroos .
And crocodiles were not behaving at that time either .
That similarity meant they probably competed .
They were eating the same kinds of foods .
That guy is going to eat all our sheep .
That was not what happened , actually .
Have a look at this bit of film footage .
Does it have to stay this way ?
In 1990 , I was in the Australian Museum .
The geneticists laughed . But this was six years before Dolly .
Cloning was science fiction . It had not happened .
But then suddenly cloning did happen .
I put a team together .
We were very excited .
Unfortunately , we also found a lot of human DNA .
We found nuclear mitochondrial genes . It &apos;s there .
So we got it .
Okay . What could we do with this stuff ?
It has to be a different species .
They &apos;re related distantly to thylacines .
Critics of this project say , hang on .
Thylacine , Tasmanian devil ? That &apos;s going to hurt .
No , it &apos;s not . These are marsupials .
Is this a risk ?
Are we going to get a Frankenstein ?
You know , some kind of weird hybrid chimera ?
And the answer is no .
This is a key question for everybody .
He led them around on a rope .
We &apos;d all love to have this sort of thing happen .
My interest was in whether the environment had changed .
He looked at the hut . We went inside .
The grasslands were sweeping away .
That &apos;s classic thylacine habitat .
So could we put it back ? Yes .
We need other parallel strategies coming online .
And this one interests me .
And I &apos;m positive it wouldn &apos;t .
We need to think about this in today &apos;s world .
Thank you .
Mohamed Hijri : A simple solution to the coming phosphorus crisis
Okay , so most of you are .
I think we can all agree it &apos;s a serious issue .
Right ?
For the simple reason that nobody else is talking about it .
The answer is that it comes from how we farm .
We use fertilizers in our farming , chemical fertilizers .
Why do we use chemical fertilizers in agriculture ?
So , what does a plant need in order to grow ?
So , the plant &apos;s roots will extract these resources .
Why phosphorus in particular ?
Because it is the most problematic chemical element .
Cell membranes are phosphorus-based : These are called phospholipids .
The energy in all living things , ATP , is phosphorus-based .
DNA is our genetic heritage .
Now , where do we find this phosphorus ?
As humans , where do we find it ?
It &apos;s true that some humans eat better than others .
Some are happier than others .
Intensive agriculture is based on the use of chemical fertilizers .
Let me explain .
You &apos;re going to tell me it &apos;s wasteful .
Eighty percent of each dose of phosphorus is lost .
Modern agriculture depends on phosphorus .
Now , where will we get this phosphorus from ?
Basically , we get it out of mines .
So that really puts it into perspective .
So , we get phosphorus from mines .
What is the current state of the world &apos;s phosphorus reserves ?
The black line represents predictions for phosphorus reserves .
In 2030 , we &apos;ll reach the peak .
The dotted line shows where we are today .
Do we have a solution ?
Less and less phosphorus will be available .
What should we do ?
It truly is a paradoxical situation .
Remember that 80 percent is destined to be lost .
This mushroom exists in symbiosis with the roots .
This slide illustrates the elements of a mycorrhiza .
Normally , a root will find phosphorus all by itself .
Beyond one millimeter , the root is ineffective .
It cannot go further in its search for phosphorus .
Now , imagine this tiny , microscopic mushroom .
And it is through this structure that mutual exchanges will occur .
True symbiosis .
A very small amount of phosphorus will remain in the soil .
That &apos;s completely natural .
The plant is only able to seek out soluble forms .
These are trials in a field of sorghum .
With only a half-dose , we achieved a better yield .
This is to show you that this method works .
This is an example of soy production in Canada .
Mycorrhiza was used in one field but not in the other .
The problem is that people are not aware of it .
In conclusion , I am a scientist and a dreamer .
I &apos;m passionate about this topic .
Thank you for your attention .
To the first son , he left half the camels .
Well three sons got into a negotiation .
Seventeen doesn &apos;t divide by two .
It doesn &apos;t divide by three .
It doesn &apos;t divide by nine .
Brotherly tempers started to get strained .
So then they had 18 camels .
You get 17 .
They had one camel left over .
They gave it back to the wise old woman .
I basically see humanity a bit like those three brothers .
We &apos;re all one family .
That &apos;s the question .
It &apos;s actually surprisingly simple .
It &apos;s not easy , but it &apos;s simple .
It &apos;s not even new .
It may be one of our most ancient human heritages .
The secret to peace is us .
Let me give you just a story , an example .
So how do they deal with their differences ?
That system , I call the &quot; third side . &quot;
And we can play an incredibly constructive role .
It &apos;s very easy to react .
Human beings -- we &apos;re reaction machines .
And so the third side reminds us of that .
There was a war going on , as you know .
Look at what you Americans are doing in Puerto Rico . &quot;
The conversation got back on track .
Question is : where &apos;s the third side there ?
How could we possibly go to the balcony ?
Let me just ask you one question first .
Just out of curiosity , how many of you ?
Okay , so the great majority of us .
And here , it &apos;s so far away .
Why do we pay so much attention to this conflict ?
Is it the number of deaths ?
Stories matter . As an anthropologist , I know that .
Stories are what we use to transmit knowledge .
They give meaning to our lives .
Stories are the key .
What would that mean ? What is the story there ?
What &apos;s the origin story of the Middle East ?
That man , of course , was Abraham .
He &apos;s the father of us all .
That &apos;s what he &apos;s known for , his hospitality .
Today we face the scourge of terrorism .
What is terrorism ?
What &apos;s the opposite of terrorism ?
What if that could be a vaccine against religious intolerance ?
How would you bring that story to life ?
And that was my thinking of how would you do that .
And that &apos;s what comes to the first step here .
You retrace the footsteps of Abraham .
Because walking has a real power .
Who fights while they walk ?
People said , &quot; That &apos;s crazy . You can &apos;t .
You &apos;ve got to cross all these borders .
And so we studied the idea at Harvard .
We did our due diligence .
So effectively , we went from womb to tomb .
Let me ask you a question .
How many of you have ever had that experience ?
That &apos;s the essence of the Abraham path .
He &apos;s alive ; he &apos;s a living presence .
It &apos;s an amazing experience .
It was Abraham Path Day .
The media love it ; they really adore it .
It brought us hope .
And so that &apos;s what it &apos;s about .
She &apos;s desperately poor .
They sit on the floor .
She doesn &apos;t even have a tablecloth .
That &apos;s the potential of the Abraham path .
The potential is basically to change the game .
And in that sense , the Abraham path is a game-changer .
Let me just show you one thing .
What would the oak tree look like ?
It was done in South Africa .
It was done in Northern Ireland .
It could be done anywhere .
It simply depends on us .
It depends on us taking the third side .
We &apos;re about to take a break in a moment .
That &apos;s a third side act .
That &apos;s walking Abraham &apos;s path .
After a TEDTalk , why not a TEDWalk ?
So let me just leave you with three things .
One is , the secret to peace is the third side .
The third side is us .
Thank you very much .
Shereen El Feki : A little-told tale of sex and sensuality
&quot; I have two medical certificates to prove it . &quot;
I &apos;m half Egyptian , and I &apos;m Muslim .
The first of these is politics .
That second red line is religion .
Audience : Sex .
Shereen El Feki : Louder , I can &apos;t hear you .
Audience : Sex .
SEF : Again , please don &apos;t be shy .
Audience : Sex .
SEF : Absolutely , that &apos;s right , it &apos;s sex .
Marriage is your ticket to adulthood .
Faiza was living proof of this .
Her virginity statement was not a piece of wishful thinking .
Faiza chose a different route : non-vaginal sex .
Only she became pregnant all the same .
Sadly , Faiza is not alone .
Football , everybody talks about it , but hardly anyone plays .
Hot stuff !
Today , this history is largely unknown in the Arab region .
no matter where we live and love .
Thank you .
iO Tillett Wright : Fifty shades of gay
What &apos;s your name ? Where are you from ?
How old are you ? What do you do ?
Then we get more personal with it .
Have you ever had any diseases ?
Have you ever been divorced ?
What are you into ? Who are you into ?
What gender do you like to sleep with ?
I get it .
We are neurologically hardwired to seek out people like ourselves .
We seek out environments that reinforce our personal choices .
Because the categories , I &apos;ve found , are too limiting .
The boxes are too narrow .
And this can get really dangerous .
I grew up in a very sheltered environment .
They said they wouldn &apos;t let girls play .
I mean , who knows , right ?
When you &apos;re six , maybe you can do that .
I kept up the charade for eight years .
So this is me when I was 11 .
I didn &apos;t feel like I was in the wrong body .
I felt like I was performing this elaborate act .
I wouldn &apos;t have qualified as transgender .
No one is exactly shocked .
But I wasn &apos;t asked to define myself by my parents .
I was legally and indisputably a second-class citizen .
I was not an activist .
I wave no flags in my own life .
Were we even a group ? What group ?
It might give them pause .
And they funded two weeks of shooting in New York .
And then we made this .
Self Evident Truths is a photographic record of LGBTQ America today .
It &apos;s written in the Declaration of Independence .
There is no equality in the United States .
The fight for equal rights is not just about gay marriage .
So far we &apos;ve shot 300 faces in New York City .
I want to take the project across the country .
Absolutely nothing could have prepared us for what happened after that .
So I changed my immediate goal to 10,000 faces .
Visibility really is key .
Familiarity really is the gateway drug to empathy .
Sparking empathy had become the backbone of Self Evident Truths .
In fact , on the contrary , it highlights them .
Can you quantify your openness ?
I &apos;ll take your picture just for trying .
And the reality that this presents is a complicated one .
Where exactly does one become a second-class citizen ?
What we see are human beings in all their multiplicity .
And seeing them makes it harder to deny their humanity .
It &apos;s too late .
Because I already am all of those things .
Thank you .
I just wanted you to know that .
So as I said , neurosurgery comes from a long tradition .
It &apos;s been around for about 7,000 years .
They didn &apos;t know exactly what they were doing .
Not much has changed , by the way .
But this was common .
We can turn it up or down , on or off .
So this looks something like this .
That &apos;s a little better . That side is better .
We &apos;re now going to turn it on .
It &apos;s on . Just turned it on .
And this works like that , instantly .
We want you to stop doing that . &quot;
And we do that with electricity .
So dystonia is a disorder affecting children .
There are eight children in the family .
Five of them have dystonia .
So here he is .
So he is one of five kids .
He did not respond to any drugs .
We did not know what to do with this boy .
It is the sadness center of the brain .
And so patients with depression have hyperactivity .
The area of the brain for sadness is on red hot .
So we went ahead and implanted electrodes in patients with depression .
This is work done with my colleague Helen Mayberg from Emory .
Can we use deep brain stimulation to make you smarter ?
Anybody interested in that ?
Of course we can , right ?
Now we &apos;re not going to do this in normal people .
They shut down . They turn off .
These areas of the brain are shut down .
The lights are out in these areas of the brain .
So this is now in clinical trials .
We can now reach those circuits .
We can introduce electrodes within those circuits .
We can graduate the activity of those circuits .
Thank you very much .
Damon Horowitz : Philosophy in prison
Meet Tony . He &apos;s my student .
There &apos;s the punk on the ground , puddle of blood .
I know what is wrong . I have done wrong .
You think you know right and wrong ?
Then can you tell me what wrong is ?
No , don &apos;t just give me an example .
What is that idea ?
What makes something wrong ?
Maybe one of us is wrong about the wrong .
We are here for knowledge .
Our enemy is thoughtlessness . This is philosophy . &quot;
And something changes for Tony .
I want to know what is wrong .
I want to know what I know . &quot;
What can creatures like us know of such things ?
Socrates died in prison , his philosophy intact .
So Tony starts doing his homework .
Turns out , Tony &apos;s got the philosophy muscle .
His body is in prison , but his mind is free .
That &apos;s Plato , Descartes , Nietzsche and Bill Clinton .
Let us think about that . &quot;
Thank you .
Halla Tomasdottir : A feminine response to Iceland &apos;s financial crash
First , of course , the economic meltdown .
Ninety-nine pence was the starting price and no reserve .
By the way , the pronunciation is &quot; Eyjafjallajokull . &quot;
None of your media got it right .
Raised quite a few eyebrows in Iceland .
So let me share with you our values .
We believe in risk awareness .
What does that mean ?
Not a complicated thing .
We care how we make our profit .
It was also about a business opportunity .
Will government change ?
Well I &apos;ll give you my straight talk about this .
Like TED , I believe in people .
Women in Iceland took the day off .
And some say this was the start of a global movement .
So we should embrace our difference and aim for challenge .
We need to start embracing the beauty of balance .
Thank you .
Kate Hartman : The art of wearable communication
My name is Kate Hartman .
I teach courses in physical computing and wearable electronics .
And it &apos;s pretty simple .
Everybody &apos;s got one -- all of you .
Don &apos;t be ashamed .
So I make other hats as well .
This one is called the Talk to Yourself Hat .
It &apos;s fairly self-explanatory .
It physically carves out conversation space for one .
So what happens when a person puts this thing on ?
What kind of an experience do they have ?
And how are they transformed by wearing it ?
So this particular device is called the Gut Listener .
And some of these are actually meant to mediate experiences .
So the Discommunicator is a tool for arguments .
And I thought , &quot; Well , hey !
Because there seems to be an issue .
The glaciers are actually leaving us .
There &apos;s no kind of social protocol for this .
I really just don &apos;t even know how to say hello .
Do I carve a message in the snow ?
And I was really struck by how much it affected me .
So , yea , this is actually just the beginning .
These are initial musings for this project .
Thanks .
We are always chasing storms .
We are doing a thousand now .
And we hope to understand something fundamental about our human nature .
You can put it louder if you can .
This is a brain .
And you have a scheme here that describes how it works .
And that &apos;s exactly what we did 10 years ago .
And Aurora liked to play video games .
Actually any primate will do that .
Think about that .
And to our shock , that &apos;s exactly what Aurora did .
She played the game without moving her body .
Well , we did that 10 years ago .
Just fast forward 10 years .
And that &apos;s exactly what they do .
The animal is controlling the avatar to touch the targets .
And that &apos;s a picture that every neurophysiologist knows .
How far can we take it ?
So where are we taking all this ?
And you can see an image produced by this consortium .
I think I &apos;m going to follow my grandmother &apos;s advice .
Thank you .
Lisa Margonelli : The political chemistry of oil
The napalm is burning there quite nicely .
So this is what happens as that burn gets going .
It takes off . It &apos;s a big woosh .
It &apos;ll just bake your retinas .
Oil is a stew of hydrocarbon molecules .
They &apos;re very important in oil spills .
It is this chemistry that makes oil so disastrous .
Oil doesn &apos;t sink , it floats .
It also makes it very viscous .
It &apos;s incredibly hard to clean up .
And every single oil is different when it hits water .
They set the prices , and I don &apos;t even know .
I am helpless over this . &quot;
That shows you how bad it is .
And that &apos;s actually very perverse .
This is BP &apos;s gas station in downtown Los Angeles .
It is green . It is a shrine to greenishness .
And we get kind of in on our own con .
We talk about energy independence . We talk about hydrogen cars .
We talk about biofuels that haven &apos;t been invented yet .
It &apos;s the &quot; Beverly Hillbillies , &quot; basically .
And then , of course , there was John D. Rockefeller .
There were no lips .
Okay , so that guy is actually still with us .
And then there &apos;s this guy , okay .
So I &apos;m saying this is kind of a distraction .
You have these pictures of birds .
They really influence people .
It started Earth Day .
Everything that we are really stemmed from this period .
We connect the dots in the supply chain .
In fact , it &apos;s continued to increase .
We put it in . There was a tremendous banditry problem .
I was there in 2003 .
We pay for it in our taxes on April 15th .
It &apos;s become this intense industrialized zone .
And finally , American families also pay a price for oil .
We need to stay away from the moratoriums .
We need to focus really back again on the molecules .
We need to focus on reducing the oil .
We need to remove the perverse incentives to use more fuel .
We actually encourage people to drive more .
We need to have more mobility choices .
They &apos;re up at NewAmerica.net.
So you &apos;re not helpless at the pump .
That &apos;s a lot .
So , three million barrels a day .
Thank you .
Ludwick Marishane : A bath without water
The Limpopo sun gets really hot in winter .
Now we need to get this thing into practice .
I had invented DryBath , the world &apos;s first bath-substituting lotion .
So we packaged DryBath in these innovative little sachets .
At least once a week .
What &apos;s stopping you ?
I &apos;m not done yet . I &apos;m not done yet .
David Steindl-Rast : Want to be happy ? Be grateful
In this , we are all together .
Now my topic is gratefulness .
How is the connection between happiness and gratefulness ?
Many people would say , well , that &apos;s very easy .
When you are happy , you are grateful .
But think again .
Is it really the happy people that are grateful ?
They radiate happiness . You are surprised .
Why ? Because they are grateful .
So it is not happiness that makes us grateful .
It &apos;s gratefulness that makes us happy .
It &apos;s gratefulness that makes you happy .
And how does it work ?
I appeal to your own experience .
We all know from experience how it goes .
We experience something that &apos;s valuable to us .
Something is given to us that &apos;s valuable to us .
And it &apos;s really given .
These two things have to come together .
You haven &apos;t bought it . You haven &apos;t earned it .
It &apos;s just given to you .
That &apos;s how gratefulness happens .
We cannot only have grateful experiences .
We can be people who live gratefully .
Grateful living , that is the thing .
And how can we live gratefully ?
It &apos;s a gift . You haven &apos;t earned it .
You haven &apos;t brought it about in any way .
It &apos;s a given moment , as we say .
Well , think again .
Behold the master key to our happiness in our own hands .
Moment by moment , we can be grateful for this gift .
Does that mean that we can be grateful for everything ?
Certainly not .
But I didn &apos;t say we can be grateful for everything .
It isn &apos;t as bad as it might seem .
Learning patience , for instance .
That takes patience . That &apos;s difficult .
That &apos;s an opportunity that is given to us .
They make something out of life .
And those who fail get another opportunity .
We always get another opportunity .
That &apos;s the wonderful richness of life .
So how can we find a method that will harness this ?
How can we do it ?
It &apos;s a very simple method .
Stop . Look . Go .
That &apos;s all .
But how often do we stop ?
We rush through life . We don &apos;t stop .
We miss the opportunity because we don &apos;t stop .
We have to stop . We have to get quiet .
And we have to build stop signs into our lives .
Every time I turned on the faucet , I was overwhelmed .
But after a while , this wears off .
So leave it up to your own imagination .
You look . You open your eyes .
You open your ears . You open your nose .
A grateful world is a world of joyful people .
We couldn &apos;t understand why it mushroomed .
And there have been 15 million candles lit in one decade .
Thank you .
Julian Treasure : Shh ! Sound health in 8 steps
Every part of your body is vibrating at different frequencies .
Your ears are always on -- you have no ear lids .
They work even when you sleep .
Ears are made not for hearing , but for listening .
Here are two of them .
Reductive listening is listening &quot; for . &quot;
Men typically listen reductively .
That &apos;s the way we talk , right guys ?
Women typically listen expansively .
Noise kills 200,000 people a year in Europe .
It &apos;s a really big problem .
It looks a bit like this .
The second problem that comes with headphone abuse is compression .
Listen to this -- this is an uncompressed piece of music .
There is a cost of compression .
You &apos;re having to imagine it .
It &apos;s not good for you in the long run .
We may be raising an entire generation of deaf people .
Now that &apos;s a really serious problem .
Protect your ears in that way .
Silence is beautiful .
The Elizabethans described language as decorated silence .
Have a foreground , a background , all in beautiful proportion .
It &apos;s fun to get into designing with sound .
Sound healing is a wonderful modality .
It &apos;s been around for thousands of years .
I do urge you to explore this .
Devotional music , good -- Mozart , good .
First of all , listen consciously .
Musicians have bigger brains -- it &apos;s true .
You can do this in groups as well .
Protect your ears ? Yes , absolutely .
So I urge you to take that path .
I wish you sound health .
Eben Bayer : Are mushrooms the new plastic ?
Not like that .
And this isn &apos;t just found in packaging .
And that &apos;s not the only place it &apos;s found .
They &apos;re not biologically compatible .
They &apos;re basically fouling up Earth &apos;s respiratory and circulatory systems .
You &apos;ll find it inside of you .
The first is feedstocks .
This is crazy .
But nature provides us with a really good model here .
And this gets us back to the mushrooms .
Because in nature , mushrooms are the recycling system .
In our process , we basically use it as a glue .
But these materials are grown from agricultural byproducts , not petroleum .
We then process these husks with some basic equipment .
It &apos;s a waste product .
Because the manufacturing process is our organism .
And it &apos;s kind of hard to picture how that happens .
So in front of your eyes , this part just self-assembled .
It actually takes a little longer . It takes five days .
But it &apos;s much faster than conventional farming .
The last step , of course , is application .
In this case , we &apos;ve grown a corner block .
So , why mycelium ?
The first reason is local open feedstocks .
Biological yield is really important .
And I think that can be some really good news .
Thank you .
Nirmalya Kumar : India &apos;s invisible innovation
They laughed . They dismissed us .
You must have gotten your education here . &quot;
It could also be novel ways of organizing firms and industries .
Process innovation is different from product innovation .
You can &apos;t be a professor without having been a student .
India has the youngest growing population in the world .
It gives you a sense of the trend .
Ladies and gentlemen , thank you very much .
Jody Williams : A realistic vision for world peace
I &apos;m actually here to make a challenge to people .
I know there have been many challenges made to people .
Peace is not &quot; Kumbaya , my Lord . &quot;
I think of meditation .
This is called human security .
And I &apos;m trying harder and harder .
Mom , I &apos;m really trying .
We need to redefine what makes us secure in this world .
It is not arming our country to the teeth .
I certainly support the START vote .
In global terms , it &apos;s a little bit of money .
It is saving the tigers .
It is stopping the tar sands .
It is all of those things .
It is using our money for all of those things .
It is about action .
I said , &quot; Yes , Your Holiness .
Your robe gives it away . &quot;
I said , &quot; That &apos;s good . That &apos;s good .
We need that in the world .
I don &apos;t follow that , but that &apos;s cool . &quot;
And he says , &quot; But I have become skeptical .
I think what we need is action . &quot;
But I talked to her for a range of issues .
But I don &apos;t believe in hope without endeavor .
Here &apos;s another woman hero of mine .
She says the airports of the world .
Wangari Maathai -- 2004 Peace laureate .
Working for peace is very creative .
It &apos;s hard work every day .
People could not gather without getting busted and taken to jail .
Working together is what changes our world .
I &apos;ll tell you the quick story .
There was a mother and three children .
The children were killed on the spot .
It was Mairead &apos;s sister .
This is Rigoberta Menchu Tum .
She also received the Peace Prize .
She is now running for president .
That &apos;s what I got stuck doing -- the landmine campaign .
They could maybe volunteer that much .
There were others , like myself , who were full-time .
It &apos;s not a dirty word .
It &apos;s hard work every single day .
Thank you .
Toni Griffin : A new vision for rebuilding Detroit
So we began our process in September of 2010 .
They came to Detroit for a better way of life .
Between 1950 and 2000 , the region grows by 30 percent .
Citywide , there are 80,000 vacant homes .
They can also see vacant property .
Citywide , there are about 100,000 vacant parcels .
So the city is 139 square miles .
So it &apos;s a lot of vacancy .
Three key imperatives were really important to our work .
Thank you .
Anil Ananthaswamy : What it takes to do extreme astrophysics
And that feeling hasn &apos;t left me yet .
And physicists came and started using it sometime in the 1980s .
This is one of the largest underground labs in the world .
And where in the world would you find such water ?
Well the Russians have a tank in their own backyard .
This is Lake Baikal .
This is Lake Baikal in the peak of the Siberian winter .
The lake is entirely frozen .
And they have dedicated their lives to it .
It &apos;s very harsh conditions .
They work on a shoestring budget .
But nonetheless , it &apos;s an extraordinary piece of engineering .
These are four 8.2 meter telescopes .
An extraordinary set of telescopes .
Here &apos;s another view of the same .
Finally , I want to take you to Antarctica .
This is cosmology &apos;s final frontier .
And here we are about to board our bus .
And that &apos;s taking us to McMurdo .
And this is the scene that greets you in McMurdo .
It &apos;s an extraordinary place .
And that process takes about two hours .
The fabric alone weighs two tons .
That &apos;s the kind of dedication these people have .
And I would like to share with you a launch .
This is a close-up of the Buddhist monastery .
And both require silence of some sort .
Thank you .
Steven Johnson : Where good ideas come from
This is the Grand Cafe here in Oxford .
Alcohol was the daytime beverage of choice .
You would be sharper and more alert .
And I think I &apos;ve found a few .
We have this very rich vocabulary to describe moments of inspiration .
I mean , this is what is happening inside your brain .
It &apos;s a new configuration that has never formed before .
So , the technology is there .
These are standard in all the industrialized worlds .
They seem to have the expertise to keep cars working .
And this is what they ended up coming with .
It &apos;s called a &quot; neonurture device . &quot;
In the inside , it &apos;s all car parts .
That &apos;s really where innovation happens .
I mean , this is one vision of it .
This is a statue from Oxford .
Darwin is a great example of this .
That &apos;s in his autobiography .
It will be useful in 2020 .
Could you just give me some time to do that ? &quot;
But that &apos;s a key thing .
And of course , this is nerd heaven , right ?
And these two guys are named Guier and Weiffenbach .
We could probably hear it , if we tune in . &quot;
That &apos;s an interesting idea . &quot;
So they made it really easy to find it .
We should record it . &quot;
That &apos;s pretty cool . &quot;
Could you go the other way ?
So they went back , and they thought about it .
And he said , &quot; Oh , that &apos;s great .
Could you work on that problem ? &quot;
And that &apos;s how GPS was born .
That is how innovation happens .
Chance favors the connected mind .
Thank you very much .
Pattie Maes + Pranav Mistry : Meet the SixthSense interaction
But I would say no .
The system tracks the four significant fingers .
The device is completely portable , and can be ...
So one important difference is that it &apos;s totally mobile .
He can ask for additional information .
Reading the newspaper -- it never has to be outdated .
This is a more controversial one .
And his girlfriend is probably not very happy about him either .
Thank you .
Harald Haas : Wireless data from every light bulb
And these are base stations .
These are cellular mobile phones .
And wireless communications has become a utility like electricity and water .
And one of the issues is capacity .
And radio waves are limited .
And we are simply running out of spectrum .
There &apos;s another problem .
That is efficiency .
And that creates a big problem .
Then there &apos;s another issue that you &apos;re all aware of .
You have to switch off your mobile phone during flights .
In hospitals , they are security issues .
And security is another issue .
These radio waves penetrate through walls .
So these are the main four issues .
And light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum .
X-rays , useful when you go to hospitals .
Then there &apos;s ultraviolet light .
So it &apos;s inherently safe to use .
And guess what ?
14 billion is the number of light bulbs installed already .
So we have the infrastructure there .
Look at the ceiling , you see all these light bulbs .
Go to the main floor , you see these light bulbs .
Can we use them for communications ?
Yes .
What do we need to do ?
An LED is a semiconductor . It &apos;s an electronic device .
And it has a very nice acute property .
So let &apos;s show how we do that .
Not usable for a YouTube video .
But not only that .
What we &apos;ve done is we have also developed a demonstrator .
And what we have here is no ordinary desk lamp .
And then what we have here is a little hole .
And the light goes through that hole .
There &apos;s a receiver .
So what happens when I switch on that light ?
Put your book beneath it and you can read .
It &apos;s illuminating the space .
You &apos;re critical .
You think , &quot; Ha , ha , ha .
But let me do this .
Once again .
Still don &apos;t believe ?
You don &apos;t notice with your human eye .
And the answer is yes .
So I &apos;ve mentioned to you the four challenges .
That &apos;s aside .
And then I &apos;ve mentioned the availability .
You need to see what to do .
You have lights in an aircraft .
So it &apos;s everywhere in a day there is light .
Look around . Everywhere . Look at your smart phone .
It has a flashlight , an LED flashlight .
These are potential sources for high-speed data transmission .
And then there &apos;s security .
And there &apos;s only data where there is light .
So the data goes in that direction , not there anymore .
But I can give you a few examples .
Well you may see the impact already now .
This is a remote operated vehicle beneath the ocean .
And they use light to illuminate space down there .
Traffic lights can communicate to the car and so on .
And every street lamp could be a free access point .
We call it , in fact , a Li-Fi , light-fidelity .
And then we have these aircraft cabins .
Thank you .
Daniel Kraft : A better way to harvest bone marrow
So actually how do we harvest this bone marrow ?
About 200 times usually .
And there is probably a better way to do this .
This is it .
Our standard see-through patient .
We can do multiple passes through that same entry .
No robots required .
And played around with this a little bit .
And our team members developed this technology .
And eventually we got two large animals , and pig studies .
This device was just FDA approved in the last year .
This was done under local anesthesia , as an outpatient .
You all know about embryonic stem cells .
Thanks .
Marco Tempest : A cyber-magic card trick like no other
You &apos;ve probably all heard of Google &apos;s Project Glass .
So these are my illusion glasses .
They &apos;re a little bigger . They &apos;re a prototype .
Let me show you what I mean .
All right . Very significant mark .
Voice : System ready . Acquiring image .
There are 13 cards in each suit .
MT : There are two colors in a deck of cards .
Make a wish .
Wake up .
Joker : Whoa.MT : Are you ready for your party piece ?
Joker : Presenting my pogo stick.MT : Ah . Watch out .
Joker : Whoa , whoa , whoa , oh !
I &apos;m performing for you .
Whoa .
Well , to this , I just say , no no .
Actually , in German , it &apos;s nein nein .
Voice : Why not ? That &apos;s a very good hand .
The odds of getting it are 4,165 to one .
Digital MT : This is without a question the real thing .
MT : Bye bye .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Nancy Lublin : Texting that saves lives
I think it might be a lifeline .
I can help you with those later .
It might be the only way to communicate with your kids .
And the secret is she opens every single one .
Texting has a 100 percent open rate .
Now the parents are really alarmed .
I promise she read that text .
And this isn &apos;t some suburban iPhone-using teen phenomenon .
Texting actually overindexes for minority and urban youth .
We &apos;re finding it 11 times more powerful than email .
We &apos;ve also found an unintended consequence .
We &apos;ve been getting text messages back like these .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to go to school today .
The boys call me faggot . &quot;
But I just started again an hour ago . &quot;
Or , &quot; He won &apos;t stop raping me .
He told me not to tell anyone .
It &apos;s my dad . Are you there ? &quot;
That last one &apos;s an actual text message that we received .
And yeah , we &apos;re there .
I will not forget the day we got that text message .
Because this isn &apos;t what we do .
We do social change .
It &apos;s fast , it &apos;s pretty private .
It &apos;s real time .
We can help millions of teens with counseling and referrals .
That &apos;s great .
But the thing that really makes this awesome is the data .
I want to prevent this shit from happening .
So think about a cop .
There &apos;s something in New York City .
And then they started crime mapping .
So think about the data from a crisis text line .
Or maybe there &apos;s some anecdotal evidence .
Imagine having real time data on every one of those issues .
You could inform legislation .
You could inform school policy .
What &apos;s going on in your school ? &quot;
Thank you .
Phil Hansen : Embrace the shake
This was the destruction of my dream of becoming an artist .
I was making all these scribble pictures .
I actually didn &apos;t even have a regular pair of scissors .
Embrace the shake .
So the end image was never visible as a physical whole .
It was destroyed before it ever existed .
It did not happen overnight .
And what if I didn &apos;t embrace the shake ?
Thank you .
Kelly McGonigal : How to make stress your friend
Anyone ?
How about a moderate amount of stress ?
Who has experienced a lot of stress ?
Yeah . Me too .
But that is not my confession .
Basically , I &apos;ve turned stress into the enemy .
Okay . Some bad news first .
That is over 20,000 deaths a year .
You can see why this study freaked me out .
It &apos;s called the social stress test .
Now we &apos;re going to all do this together .
It &apos;s going to be fun .
For me .
as fast as you can , starting with 996 .
Go !
Audience : Go faster . Faster please .
You &apos;re going too slow .
Stop . Stop , stop , stop .
That guy made a mistake .
We are going to have to start all over again .
You &apos;re not very good at this , are you ?
Okay , so you get the idea .
That pounding heart is preparing you for action .
If you &apos;re breathing faster , it &apos;s no problem .
It &apos;s getting more oxygen to your brain .
So my goal as a health psychologist has changed .
I no longer want to get rid of your stress .
I want to make you better at stress .
And we just did a little intervention .
Oxytocin is a neuro-hormone .
It fine-tunes your brain &apos;s social instincts .
It primes you to do things that strengthen close relationships .
Oxytocin makes you crave physical contact with your friends and family .
It enhances your empathy .
But here &apos;s what most people don &apos;t understand about oxytocin .
It &apos;s a stress hormone .
Well , oxytocin doesn &apos;t only act on your brain .
It &apos;s a natural anti-inflammatory .
It also helps your blood vessels stay relaxed during stress .
I want to finish by telling you about one more study .
Caring created resilience .
Stress gives us access to our hearts .
Thank you .
This is kind of amazing , what you &apos;re telling us .
Rory Sutherland : Perspective is everything
What you have here is an electronic cigarette .
It &apos;s really , really tiring .
So the power of reframing things cannot be overstated .
And reality isn &apos;t a particularly good guide to human happiness .
And when it nuzzles the button , the electric shock stops .
The other dog doesn &apos;t have the button .
Generally the first dog can be relatively content .
The second dog lapses into complete depression .
It &apos;s an interesting question .
Because they are actually the same thing .
I think psychological value is great to be absolutely honest .
I think that &apos;s true actually .
We didn &apos;t have a framework .
You know my example of the Eurostar .
And I think that &apos;s probably right .
But this does not apply the other way around .
Red traffic lights have a countdown delay .
It &apos;s proven to reduce the accident rate in experiments .
Which isn &apos;t a great idea .
The Koreans , very assiduously , did test both .
It &apos;s an innate thing called goal dilution .
Ayelet Fishbach has written a paper about this .
So we walk out of the shops with one of each .
Don &apos;t give them 24 white pills .
It &apos;s called chunking .
This is a toll crossing in Britain .
Quite often queues happen at the tolls .
Sometimes you get very , very severe queues .
Time means more to some people than others .
And I think understanding that could revolutionize tax policy .
It could revolutionize the public services .
It could really change things quite significantly .
Here &apos;s a guy you all need to study .
And so they &apos;re predominantly interested in psychology .
I think they &apos;re right .
Von Mises completely rejected this distinction .
And he used this following analogy .
Try this quick thought experiment .
And it &apos;s vital we understand this .
The effort to do that almost broke the organization .
That &apos;s pretty good .
And so perception actually is leaky in any case .
Thank you very much .
Elif Shafak : The politics of fiction
I &apos;m a storyteller .
I was born in Strasbourg , France to Turkish parents .
It will dry up inside .
We all do .
We &apos;re born into a certain family , nation , class .
I started writing fiction at the age of eight .
And thus began my life-long passion for writing fiction .
Now one other thing happened around this same time .
My mother became a diplomat .
I also had my first taste of cultural stereotypes there .
I was in Istanbul when the earthquake hit in 1999 .
I started writing fiction in English .
So I feel connected to each language in a different way .
And that gap is very intimidating .
And because God loves her , I did get married .
But instead of settling down , I went to Arizona .
I asked him what he meant by that .
And I also understood that I would keep disappointing him .
He wanted to see the manifestation of my identity .
It was only because of our passports .
A function is attributed to fiction .
It comes from everywhere .
My micro story became a macro issue when I was prosecuted .
It was just a story .
And only the latter is an artist &apos;s responsibility . &quot;
Identity politics divides us . Fiction connects .
One is interested in sweeping generalizations .
The other , in nuances .
One draws boundaries .
The other recognizes no frontiers .
Identity politics is made of solid bricks .
Fiction is flowing water .
Today , stories continue to transcend borders .
Literature has to take us beyond .
But I &apos;m also aware of the danger of fetishizing them .
Like that , my fiction as well .
It &apos;s between buildings .
I &apos;m intrigued by this concept .
We usually distrust those areas that fall in between things .
When I write fiction I cherish elusiveness and changeability .
I like not knowing what will happen 10 pages later .
I like it when my characters surprise me .
I think it was a wonderful paradigm shift .
Perhaps that &apos;s not the right way to start at all .
Thank you .
Naturally 7 : A full-band beatbox
We &apos;re ready to fly ! Thank you very much .
Chris Bliss : Comedy is translation
And it &apos;s a charming read .
So no ego problems .
I don &apos;t need a husband who wants to be . &quot;
And that &apos;s when I discovered comedy .
They were lifted verbatim from Palin &apos;s own remarks .
Here was a Palin impersonator quoting Palin word for word .
The description perfectly captured Edwards &apos; personal vanity .
And guess what ?
His intent is to be funny .
Flight-or-fight releases adrenalin , which throws our walls up sky-high .
Now let me give you an example from my act .
Three things I &apos;ve tried to avoid my entire life .
Have at it you radical bastards . The field is yours .
Why is this remotely controversial ?
You have given birth to an abomination .
Remove it from your household .
Economy of language is another real strong suit of great comedy .
That &apos;s an entire childhood in three words .
People can &apos;t wait to pass along that new great joke .
And this isn &apos;t some new phenomenon of our wired world .
First there were drums and then knock-knock jokes .
And he used to be the USA Today Monday morning guy .
So we started talking about climate change .
You &apos;ve got to love that idea .
And this cartoon hit the bull &apos;s eye .
And it didn &apos;t stop there .
That is a lot of punch for 14 words .
Thank you .
Sheikha Al Mayassa : Globalizing the local , localizing the global
Qatar is no exception to the region .
It &apos;s a very young nation led by young people .
Her answer was quite the contrary .
Not that you do ; I &apos;m just saying .
We know that modernization is happening .
And yes , Qatar wants to be a modern nation .
It &apos;s important for us to grow organically .
And we continuously make the conscious decision to reach that balance .
And therefore tradition becomes more important , not less important .
I &apos;m a representation of that phenomenon .
How does that impact our desert culture ?
And guess what ?
No , I don &apos;t think so .
Art becomes a very important part of our national identity .
You know , art and culture is big business .
Ask me .
Ask the chairpersons and CEOs of Sotheby &apos;s and Christie &apos;s .
Ask Charles Saatchi about great art .
They make a lot of money .
Why else do Greeks demand the return of the Elgin Marbles ?
She does that through important visual forms of photography and film .
Our mission is of cultural integration and independence .
We don &apos;t want their collections .
For me it was a new discovery .
Now visual expression is just one form of culture integration .
Last year we didn &apos;t have one Qatari woman filmmaker .
And this is one of our filmmakers &apos; products .
Who are you playing ?
Girl : Uncle Khaled . Here , put on the headscarf .
Khaled : Why would I want to put it on ?
Girl : Do as you &apos;re told , young girl .
Boy : No , you play mom and I play dad .
Play by yourself then .
Girl : Women ! One word and they get upset .
Useless .
Thank you . Thank you !
It attracted 42,000 people , and we showcased 51 films .
It &apos;s important for two things .
Culture &apos;s a very important tool to bring people together .
We should not underestimate it .
This is a very interesting journey .
Familiarity destroys and trumps fear . Try it .
Ladies and gentlemen , thank you very much . Shokran .
Christopher &quot; moot &quot; Poole &quot; : The case for anonymity online
Tom Green : That &apos;s a 4chan thing .
It &apos;s a video game move from &quot; Star Fox . &quot;
&quot; Star Fox 20 &quot; ?
And it was a Japanese forum and imageboard .
And we &apos;ve gone from one board to 48 boards .
This is what it looks like .
And Rick Astley &apos;s kind of rebirth these past two years ...
There are thousands of memes that come out of the site .
So does a site like this have rules ?
Rule one is you don &apos;t talk about / b / .
Two is you do not talk about / b / .
And I will spare you that slide .
I assure you , it is very true .
It is where a third of all the traffic is going .
So they broke that poll .
And I ended up on top .
I ended up at this really fancy party .
But that &apos;s not what &apos;s interesting about this .
They are still protesting .
Dusty is the name that we &apos;ve given to this cat .
They matched , they found his MySpace .
As I said , it &apos;s raw , it &apos;s unfiltered .
They &apos;re endangered because we &apos;re moving towards social networking .
We &apos;re moving towards persistent identity .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Got a couple questions for you .
Don &apos;t tell .
You &apos;ve had to wrestle with issues like child pornography .
CP : Yes and no .
There are plenty of downsides .
And saying whatever you like , I think , is powerful .
Doing whatever you like is now crossing a line .
But I think it &apos;s important to have these places .
CP : There are , certainly .
CP : Yeah , I posted a thread on Sunday .
And within 24 hours , it had over 12,000 responses .
Love and peace were mentioned .
CP : Cats and dogs were mentioned too .
And that content is all off the board now .
Okay , well .
What &apos;s the commercial picture here ?
The site has adult content on it .
But you still live at home , right ?
CP : I actually moved out recently .
That &apos;s very cool .
The content is not dinner table conversation in the least .
CP : That &apos;s a good question .
Matt Ridley : When ideas have sex
The population explosion was unstoppable .
Global famine was inevitable .
The acid rain was falling on the forests .
The desert was advancing by a mile or two a year .
Lifespan is up by 30 percent in my lifetime .
Child mortality is down by two-thirds .
Per-capita food production is up by a third .
And all this at a time when the population has doubled .
How did we achieve that ?
These are both real objects .
The other is obviously a computer mouse .
Homo erectus made the same tool for 30,000 generations .
There was no progress , no innovation .
It &apos;s an extraordinary phenomenon , but it &apos;s true .
Whereas the object on the right is obsolete after five years .
They &apos;ve all been combined together in this technology .
They &apos;ve come together .
How does evolution do cumulative , combinatorial things ?
Well , it uses sexual reproduction .
One goes extinct for the other to survive .
It &apos;s not confined to its own lineage .
It &apos;s a unique human feature .
No other animal does it .
You can have culture without exchange .
You can have , as it were , asexual culture .
Chimpanzee troops have different cultures in different troops .
There &apos;s no exchange of ideas between them .
And why does exchange raise living standards ?
Well , the answer came from David Ricardo in 1817 .
So Oz is better at both spears and axes than Adam .
He doesn &apos;t need Adam .
He can make his own spears and axes .
So the gains from trade are only going to grow .
Adam and Oz both saved an hour of time .
And the answer is about half a second .
The stone axe was made by someone for himself .
It was self-sufficiency .
We call that poverty these days .
How many other people ?
Tens ? Hundreds ? Thousands ?
You know , I think it &apos;s probably millions .
And that &apos;s the way society works .
That &apos;s what we &apos;ve achieved as a species .
Louis XIV had a lot of people working for him .
He had 498 people to prepare his dinner every night .
There &apos;s no working for each other across the colonies .
That is to say , they specialize with respect to reproduction .
The queen does it all .
In our species , we don &apos;t like doing that .
So when did this habit start ?
But I &apos;ve got no evidence for that .
They were a highly cooperative species .
They were a highly intelligent species .
They were imaginative . They buried their dead .
And so it looks like they probably had linguistic skills .
They were brilliant people . I &apos;m not dissing the Neanderthals .
But there &apos;s no evidence of a sexual division of labor .
There &apos;s no evidence of gathering behavior by females .
It looks like the females were cooperative hunters with the men .
They &apos;re always made from local chert .
Trade is 10 times as old as farming .
And that &apos;s evidence that people have started exchanging between groups .
And that will have led to specialization .
An example is Tasmania .
The Tasmanians were isolated .
But who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
Nobody , literally nobody .
I mean this quite seriously .
The president of the computer mouse company doesn &apos;t know .
He just knows how to run a company .
It &apos;s not the same with language .
It &apos;s completely irrelevant .
So we &apos;ve created something called the collective brain .
We &apos;re just the nodes in the network .
We &apos;re the neurons in this brain .
However , bad things happen .
Thank you .
Honor Harger : A history of the universe in sound
Space , we all know what it looks like .
And indeed , most people associate space with silence .
This is the planet Jupiter .
Well the answer is the science of radio astronomy .
So Thomas Watson wasn &apos;t listening to us .
We didn &apos;t have the technology to transmit .
So what were these strange noises ?
Radio could carry sound without wires .
They turned out to be lightning or sources of electrical power .
Let &apos;s jump ahead again .
It &apos;s 1964 , and we &apos;re back at Bell Labs .
They were really listening to the galaxy in high fidelity .
There was a glitch in their soundtrack .
A mysterious persistent noise was disrupting their research .
There were pigeons roosting in the dish .
But the noise didn &apos;t disappear .
Thanks .
Stewart Brand : The dawn of de-extinction . Are you ready ?
Now , extinction is a different kind of death .
It &apos;s bigger .
Suddenly it wasn &apos;t here at all .
What happened ?
Well , commercial hunting happened .
It was the cheapest source of protein in America .
There &apos;s an upside to the story .
But a lot of other animals weren &apos;t saved .
The Carolina parakeet was a parrot that lit up backyards everywhere .
It was hunted to death for its feathers .
It happened to lots of mammals .
Another keystone species is a famous animal called the European aurochs .
There was sort of a movie made about it recently .
And the aurochs was like the bison .
The extinctions still go on .
There &apos;s an ibex in Spain called the bucardo .
It went extinct in 2000 .
A little bit of film was shot .
Sorrow , anger , mourning .
Don &apos;t mourn . Organize .
George Church thinks you can .
It &apos;s kind of like an evolution machine .
The passenger pigeon has 1.3 billion base pairs in its genome .
It &apos;s called an allele .
Well that &apos;s what happens in normal hybridization anyway .
Genetically , the band-tailed pigeon already is mostly living passenger pigeon .
There &apos;s just some bits that are band-tailed pigeon .
Now , there &apos;s work to do .
You have to figure out exactly what genes matter .
Add them all up and the result won &apos;t be perfect .
So this meeting in Boston led to three things .
We hired him full-time .
De-extinction falls in that category .
Some of these conservation biologists are pretty radical .
Another amazing story came from Alberto Fernández-Arias .
Alberto worked with the bucardo in Spain .
It was the first de-extinction in history .
It was short-lived .
Sometimes interspecies clones have respiration problems .
Cryopreservation pioneer of great depth is Oliver Ryder .
Since it &apos;s so pluripotent , it can become germ plasm .
Real falcons out of slightly doctored chickens .
Ben Novak was the youngest scientist at the meeting .
He showed how all of this can be put together .
So what do you do about that ?
Here &apos;s a couple related examples .
The California condor was down to 22 birds in 1987 .
Everybody thought is was finished .
That technology will be used on de-extincted animals .
Another success story is the mountain gorilla in Central Africa .
In 1981 , Dian Fossey was sure they were going extinct .
There were just 254 left .
That &apos;s how comfortable these wild gorillas are with visitors .
There &apos;s no breeding pairs left .
A bit of cloning , you can get them back .
So where do we go from here ?
These have been private meetings so far .
I think it &apos;s time for the subject to go public .
What do people think about it ?
You know , do you want extinct species back ?
Do you want extinct species back ?
Tinker Bell is going to come fluttering down .
What are they concerned about ?
We &apos;re also going to push ahead with the passenger pigeon .
Thank you .
Thank you .
I &apos;ve got a question .
So , this is an emotional topic . Some people stand .
There &apos;s going to be unintended consequences .
We will get woolly mammoths back .
Thank you so much for presenting . SB : Thank you .
Thank you .
Tan Le : A headset that reads your brainwaves
This actually forms a large part of our decision-making process .
There is no longer any consistency in the surface signals .
The second challenge is the actual device for observing brainwaves .
Now on to the detection algorithms .
Evan . Okay .
He just hangs out . He &apos;s relaxed .
Evan Grant : Let &apos;s do &quot; pull . &quot;
So : one , two , three , go .
Okay .
So once we accept this , the cube is live .
Ah , good job !
That &apos;s really amazing .
This is &quot; disappear . &quot;
Okay . Let &apos;s try that .
Oh , my goodness . He &apos;s just too good .
Let &apos;s try that again .
EG : Losing concentration .
Good job . Good job .
Now blink right to go right .
Now blink left to turn back left .
Now smile to go straight .
TL : We really -- Thank you .
Madeleine Albright : On being a woman and a diplomat
Pat Mitchell : What is the story of this pin ?
Madeleine Albright : This is &quot; Breaking the Glass Ceiling . &quot;
PM : Oh .
That was well chosen , I would say , for TEDWomen .
I &apos;ll tell you what happened .
And so I happened to have a snake pin .
So I wore it when we talked about Iraq .
And then I thought , well this is fun .
So that &apos;s how it all started .
PM : So how large is the collection ?
Pretty big .
It &apos;s now traveling .
PM : So is this a good idea .
But people did pay attention to what clothes I had .
Go out and look like a diplomat . &quot;
and so how did you handle that ?
So it evolved .
But basically I love being a woman .
and &quot; will I really say something intelligent ? &quot;
Only girls are Secretary of State . &quot;
PM : Because in her lifetime -- That would be so .
PM : What a change that is .
Where are we ?
From some people .
I think that they thought that it was a soft issue .
The women in Bosnia were being raped .
Now there are 192 .
PM : Is that &quot; Girl 7 ? &quot; Girl 7 .
And we lobbied on behalf of women &apos;s issues .
If you think that , you &apos;ve forgotten high school .
And it was really terrific .
Because one of the things I think you &apos;ll understand .
And so then Tarja was sitting across the table from me .
More women &apos;s voices at the table ?
More men who believe that the balance is best ?
Thank you for joining us today .
Thank you all . Thanks Pat .
Eric Giler : A demo of wireless electricity
I mean , think about how much we love this .
The other thing is , we love batteries .
So I thought I &apos;d better look it up first .
Wires suck , they really do .
The other thing is , batteries suck too .
And they really , really do .
Do you ever wonder what happens to this stuff ?
40 billion of these things built .
This is what happens .
Think about that .
And nature really does abhor a vacuum .
But inside a standard transformer are two coils of wire .
So how does it work ?
Number one question I get asked .
I mean , people are worried about cellphones being safe .
You know . What about safety ?
It doesn &apos;t radiate .
We live in a magnetic field .
And it &apos;s virtually impossible in nature to make that happen .
Mobile electronics .
Home electronics .
There are industrial applications .
And then finally , electric vehicles .
These electric cars are beautiful .
But who is going to want to plug them in ?
And it actually causes your car to charge safely and efficiently .
Credit cards , robot vacuum cleaners .
You &apos;ve got a coil .
We put one on the back of the television set .
It will cause one to get created on the other side .
So , I &apos;ll plug that in .
It creates a magnetic field here .
It causes one to be created out here .
This is a commercially -- available color television set .
How many people want to hang them on the wall ?
Imagine if you can get rid of it .
The other thing I wanted to talk about was safety .
So , there is nothing going on . I &apos;m okay .
So , I wanted to show you something .
We &apos;re an equal opportunity designer of this sort of thing .
This a Google G1 .
It runs the Android operating system .
I think I heard somebody talk about that before .
It &apos;s odd . It has a battery .
you &apos;re looking at a cellphone powered completely wirelessly .
And I know some of you are Apple aficionados .
And Nokia as well .
But they typically use it to light up the screen .
You never have to worry about plugging these things in again .
And think of what that would do for you .
So , thank you very much .
Rob Dunbar : Discovering ancient climates in oceans and ice
We &apos;ll look at sea level rise .
We &apos;ll look at ocean warming .
What frightens you ? &quot;
for me , it &apos;s ocean acidification .
And this has come onto the stage pretty recently .
So I will spend a little time at the end .
It really wasn &apos;t on the radar screen .
You know , they were marginalized in the negotiation room .
One of the problems is coming up with the right target .
It &apos;s not clear what the target should be .
But there &apos;s not a lot of science behind that number .
Should it be 450 ? Should it be 400 ?
There &apos;s not a lot of science behind that one either .
Now , why is this so complicated ?
There &apos;s all kinds of natural causes of climate change .
There &apos;s air-sea interactions .
Volcanoes eject aerosols into the atmosphere .
That changes our climate .
The ocean contains most of the exchangeable heat on the planet .
And we know the solar output &apos;s not constant through time .
So those are all natural causes of climate change .
Now , we have many ways to study natural variability .
I &apos;ll show you a few examples of this now .
It &apos;s a scientific drilling vessel .
And so that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done with this ship .
This was -- this is south of the Antarctic Circle .
It looks downright tropical there .
Most of the time it looked like this .
We had a waves up to 50 ft .
This was led by Ross Powell and Tim Naish .
It &apos;s the ANDRILL project .
And we drilled in the Ross Sea .
That &apos;s the Ross Sea Ice Shelf on the right there .
This is the part of Antarctica that we worry about .
When that ice melts , sea level rises by six meters .
Here &apos;s the cartoon on the left there .
So it &apos;s the deepest geological bore hole ever drilled .
It took about 10 years to put this project together .
And here &apos;s what we found .
That &apos;s the kind of material in the deep sea .
So we know there &apos;s an ice shelf overhead .
And that alternates with a sediment that looks like this .
This is absolutely beautiful stuff .
And this is in the past four million years .
This was completely unexpected .
Nobody imagined that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet was this dynamic .
What caused it ?
that ice sheet became very dynamic and was very easily melted .
And you know what ?
And it could be larger than that .
Okay , the second story takes place here in Galapagos .
This is from Champion Island .
It &apos;s about a meter tall Pavona clavus colony .
And it &apos;s covered with algae . That &apos;s what happens .
Then there was similar mortality in &apos; 97- &apos; 98 .
We saw no other mass mortality events .
So these events in our recent past really are unique .
Here &apos;s how we sample the corals .
This is actually Easter Island . Look at this monster .
This coral is eight meters tall , right .
And it been growing for about 600 years .
So we have a diamond drill .
The core comes up as these cylindrical tubes of limestone .
So we &apos;ve done that all over the Eastern Pacific .
I &apos;ll take you back here to the Galapagos Islands .
Imagine that .
Each one of those is a year .
And we just count on down to the bottom .
Then their other attribute is that they have this great chemistry .
Their ratio tells us the water temperature .
The coral can take us back hundreds and thousands of years .
Here &apos;s a synthetic diagram .
There &apos;s a whole family of curves here .
We do similar things with ice cores .
We work with tree rings .
This is as messy as it gets .
You can see there &apos;s some signals there .
Some of the records show lower temperatures than others .
Some of them show greater variability .
But they all tell us what the natural variability is .
It was cooling down until about 1900 or so .
And there &apos;s the temperature up there in 2009 .
So I &apos;ll close with a short discussion of ocean acidification .
So , you cannot argue with that .
It has many consequences .
There &apos;s consequences for carbonate organisms .
The main framework material of coral reefs is calcium carbonate .
That material is more soluble in acidic fluid .
But it &apos;s not just the carbonate producers that are affected .
Thank you very much .
John Underkoffler : Pointing to the future of UI
The interface is the OS .
There were no graphics routines . There were no mouse drivers .
So it was a necessity .
Same thing for processor speeds .
So we &apos;ve got that incredible ramp-up .
So we &apos;ve forgotten to invent new interfaces .
So what happens next ? Where do we go from there ?
They don &apos;t understand real world space .
So what happens if you start to explain space to them ?
One thing you might get is something like the Luminous Room .
That &apos;s a digital storage in a physical container .
Has to come back out , whatever you put in .
So you &apos;ve got an interface that has no interface .
Here , the real world merges with the simulation .
And we make the machine meet them half way .
It projects down digital shadows , as you see here .
That &apos;s 8 a.m. shadows .
They get a little shorter at 9 a.m.
There you are , swinging the sun around .
Short shadows at noon and so forth .
And we built up a series of tools like this .
Are you blinding passers by and motorists on the freeways ?
This work is 15 years old .
And the result is sort of gratifyingly perpetual .
So here we have a bunch of stuff , some images .
And it &apos;s fun to fly through Mr. Beckett &apos;s eye .
And you can come back out through the scary orangutan .
And that &apos;s all well and good .
Let &apos;s do something a little more difficult .
Here , we have a whole bunch of disparate images .
We can fly around them .
So navigation is a fundamental issue .
You have to be able to navigate in 3D .
Now we can distribute this stuff in many different ways .
We can organize it this way .
Let &apos;s just come down a bit and fly around .
So that &apos;s a different way to look at stuff .
Here are some selection planes .
So , from there to the world of real work .
There &apos;re a lot of elements .
So here &apos;s a familiar place .
And we &apos;ll bring this back here for a second .
Maybe select a little bit of that .
And bring out this graph .
These are logistics elements that are scattered across the United States .
Well , that doesn &apos;t really cut it anymore .
And we might want to look at these various images .
We might want to ask for some help .
These are unrelated machines , right ?
So the computation is space soluble and network soluble .
So let me get some of these out of the way .
Kevin , can you help ?
All right .
So we have a large number of movies stuck inside here .
And let &apos;s just pick out a few elements .
We can zip through them as a possibility .
We may need more than one .
Yeah , let &apos;s take that one .
And , as well , as of efficacy , agency .
So I will leave you with that . Thank you .
That &apos;s our goal entirely .
I mean it &apos;s been 25 years .
Can there really be only one interface ? There can &apos;t .
You know , how can it work ?
It &apos;ll be built into architecture .
The gloves go away in a matter of months or years .
So this is the inevitability about it .
Well that &apos;s cool .
And I understand what you &apos;re asking .
John , thank you for making science-fiction real .
JU : It &apos;s been a great pleasure .
Thank you to you all .
Caroline Casey : Looking past limits
Do you know what I wanted to be ?
I wanted to be a biker chick .
Because big sisters are always supposed to support their little sisters .
So I used to get my eyes tested just for fun .
I am , and have been since birth , legally blind .
And what the hell does that mean to you ?
I might buy some more time .
Hey .
See this hand ?
Beyond this hand is a world of Vaseline .
And every woman , you are so beautiful .
No special needs schools .
No labels .
No limitations .
My ability and my potential .
And they decided to tell me that I could see .
But very quickly I recovered . It was like that .
And I believed I could do it .
So I rammed through life as only a Casey can do .
And I was an archeologist , and then I broke things .
And then I went to business school .
And you know , disabled people are hugely educated .
And they didn &apos;t even know .
And it &apos;s extraordinary how far belief can take you .
Wonderfully , my eyes decided , enough .
And temporarily , very unexpectedly , they dropped .
And two years in , I really could see very little .
I was 28 years old .
And I simply said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry .
I can &apos;t see , and I need help . &quot;
Asking for help can be incredibly difficult .
And it &apos;s frightening , isn &apos;t it ?
But all that belief had fueled me so long .
Can I tell you , airports are a disaster .
Oh , for the love of God .
And please , any designers out there ?
I always end up in the gents &apos; toilets .
And there &apos;s nothing wrong with my sense of smell .
It &apos;s such a small thing , right ?
But before I got to him , I was so lost .
I had no idea who I was anymore .
God no , it was therapy .
Why are you fighting so hard not to be yourself ?
And do you love what you do , Caroline ? &quot;
To leave would be failure .
And he said , &quot; Do you love it ? &quot;
I couldn &apos;t even speak I was so choked up .
I just was so -- how do I tell him ?
Hardly appropriate at this moment in time .
He thought I was mad enough anyway .
And that door closed .
And my chest ached .
But I did know the game was up .
Really not a very sensible thing to do .
And I went on a run that I know so well .
I always run it perfectly fine .
And there was a rock that I always missed .
And I &apos;d never fallen on it , never .
And I didn &apos;t know what to do .
Because who am I going to be ?
What am I going to be ? &quot;
I had lost my belief .
Look where my belief had brought me to .
I was crumpled .
Do something different . What do you want to be ?
Do something different . What do you want to be ? &quot;
And really slowly , slowly , slowly , it happened .
And it did happen this way .
You don &apos;t get more different than that . &quot;
And nobody can tell me no .
Yes , you can say I can &apos;t be an archeologist .
I know how to be Mowgli .
I &apos;m going to be an elephant handler . &quot;
From global management consultant to elephant handler .
But I knew I would .
And together we would trek a thousand kilometers across India .
But you know , I was believing in the wrong thing .
Six thousand people got to see because of that .
I chucked in my job at Accenture .
It was extraordinary .
That &apos;s what I wanted to do .
It just seemed that it was possible .
Even though I present confident , I was scared .
He said , &quot; Be you . &quot;
And so here I am .
This is me , all of me .
Being absolutely true to yourself is freedom .
And I never needed eyes to see -- never .
I simply needed vision and belief .
I no longer want anybody to be invisible .
We all have to be included .
And stop with the labels , the limiting .
Losing of labels , because we are not jam jars .
We are extraordinary , different , wonderful people .
Thank you .
Sam Richards : A radical experiment in empathy
My students often ask me , &quot; What is sociology ? &quot;
How can I understand those invisible forces ? &quot;
And I say , &quot; Empathy .
Start with empathy .
It all begins with empathy .
Here , I &apos;ll give you an example .
And they got fabulously wealthy in doing so .
And they built beautiful cities all powered on that coal .
This is what I saw .
And then I asked myself the question .
Does this sound familiar ?
And back in China , what do they say in China ?
You can &apos;t expect that . &quot;
And we fight back , and it gets really ugly .
And the Chinese respond in a very ugly way .
And just imagine what you would feel .
And you just feel the anger and you feel the fear .
If you can , that &apos;s empathy -- that &apos;s empathy .
And you &apos;ve got to feel that .
Okay , so that &apos;s the warm up .
That &apos;s the warm up .
Now we &apos;re going to have the real radical experiment .
You want your kids to have a better life .
So you have a sense of what the Americans are thinking .
But really , you just want a better life for yourself .
That &apos;s what you want .
You &apos;re Arab Muslim living in Iraq .
You want a better life for yourself .
So here , let me help you .
It &apos;s because somebody else has a design for your resource .
It &apos;s your resource ; it &apos;s not somebody else &apos;s .
It &apos;s your land ; it &apos;s your resource .
Somebody else has a design for it .
And you know why they have a design ?
You know why they have their eyes set on it ?
And what else do you think about these people ?
The Americans , they &apos;re rich .
And back home , what do you see ?
Poverty , despair , struggle .
Look , you don &apos;t live in a wealthy country .
This is Iraq .
This is what you see .
You see people struggling to get by .
And you feel something about this .
And you feel it ; you see it every day .
It &apos;s part of your life .
And you talk about it with your friends .
You read about it .
That &apos;s odd .
You can &apos;t help but think that .
You talk about it .
It &apos;s in the forefront of your mind always .
You say , &quot; How is that possible ? &quot;
Not a single person in your country has not been touched .
But there &apos;s something else .
And what do you see ? They &apos;re Christians .
They &apos;re Christians .
Why ?
You don &apos;t want Americans to die . Protect our troops .
And you feel something about that -- of course you do .
And they do wonderful things .
You read about it , you hear about it .
They don &apos;t know anything about him , but you do .
You pass it around . You pass his words around .
I mean this is serious . You &apos;re afraid .
Whatever . I don &apos;t know . &quot;
You know what it means .
It &apos;s a holy war against Muslims .
Look , invade , subdue them , take their resources .
If they won &apos;t submit , kill them .
That &apos;s what this is about .
This is frightening .
You feel frightened . Of course you feel frightened .
And the Americans : &quot; Ah , he &apos;s a knucklehead .
They laugh him off . You don &apos;t laugh him off .
&quot; He wants to burn Korans , our holy book .
These Christians , who are these Christians ?
Of course you &apos;re going to think this .
You &apos;ve got to see this -- Bible Boot Camp .
These Christians are nuts .
They &apos;re training their little kids to be soldiers for Jesus .
And go to the website .
It says &quot; U.S. Army &quot; right on it .
And you &apos;re reading this website .
You don &apos;t know that .
For you , this is like all Christians .
It &apos;s all over the Web , Bible Boot Camp .
Isn &apos;t that interesting .
And it scares you , and it frightens you .
So these guys , you see them .
They &apos;re my students , my friends .
That &apos;s what they are to you .
So here .
Of course , you got it wrong .
You &apos;re generalizing . It &apos;s wrong .
You don &apos;t understand the Americans .
It &apos;s not a Christian invasion .
You have it wrong . You &apos;ve missed it .
Of course you don &apos;t . Very few people do .
But some of you do .
And this is a perspective .
So everyone &apos;s back in the room , okay .
Now here comes the radical experiment .
So we &apos;re all back home .
This photo : this woman , man , I feel her .
I feel her .
She &apos;s anybody to me .
So here &apos;s what I want you to do .
Let &apos;s go back to my first example of the Chinese .
So I want you to go there .
And the soldiers are Chinese , and everybody else is Chinese .
As an American , how do you feel about this picture ?
What do you think about that scene ?
Okay , try this . Bring it back .
This is the scene here .
These gentlemen here , they &apos;re insurgents .
And maybe they succeeded . Maybe they succeeded .
Put yourself in the shoes of the Americans who caught them .
Can you feel the rage ?
Can you go there ?
It shouldn &apos;t be that difficult .
You just -- oh , man .
Now , put yourself in their shoes .
Are they brutal killers or patriotic defenders ?
Which one ?
I &apos;m going out to defend your freedom , your lives .
Can you imagine that ?
Can you imagine saying that ?
Can you go there ?
What do you think they &apos;re feeling ?
You see , that &apos;s empathy .
It &apos;s also understanding .
Why would you use this example of all examples ? &quot;
And I say , because ... because .
You &apos;re allowed to hate these people .
Whatever it is , you can go so far .
Step inside of the tiny , little world of somebody else .
And they build a big , complex world .
Everything has changed .
Everything in your life has changed .
And that &apos;s , of course , what this is about .
Attend to other lives , other visions .
Listen to other people , enlighten ourselves .
And now perhaps -- perhaps -- you do too .
Thank you .
Robin Ince : Science versus wonder ?
I do a radio show .
The radio show is called &quot; The Infinite Monkey Cage . &quot;
It &apos;s about science , it &apos;s about rationalism .
We know this because they did an experiment . &quot;
You bring in science , and it ruins the magic . &quot;
That &apos;s what I do .
That is gone .
This is a wonderful thing .
You &apos;ll been engulfed by a red giant . &quot;
That is a wonderful idea .
Now reincarnation , that &apos;s another thing gone -- the afterlife .
But it &apos;s not gone .
Science actually says we will live forever .
Well , there is one proviso .
That is a good thing .
We are all totally recyclable .
This is a wonderful thing .
And that is a wonderful thing there .
Love does not die because of that thing .
Pain doesn &apos;t go away either .
This is a terrible thing , even though I understand pain .
No , I just spit out a tooth .
I have a son . His name is Archie .
Now I know you don &apos;t think that .
Now in many ways , that &apos;s just a survival thing .
That is a wonderful thing .
I &apos;ve done some tests .
You house is in a terrible state .
Your partner is about to return .
You think , what should I do ?
Do nothing .
That &apos;s the strong anthropic principle of vacuuming .
For me , it &apos;s a very , very important thing .
I &apos;m sitting on a train .
I &apos;m sitting on a chair .
That , to me , is an incredible thing .
And do you know what , that might be enough .
I &apos;m glad the universe is pointless .
That &apos;s not the point . &quot;
I can make my own purpose .
You can make your own purpose .
Thank you very much . Goodbye .
Renny Gleeson : 404 , the story of a page not found
The 404 page is that .
It &apos;s that broken experience on the Web .
And it serves you the 404 page .
Because it &apos;s the feeling of a broken relationship .
Yes .
But these things are everywhere .
They &apos;re on sites big , they &apos;re on sites small .
This is a global experience .
A 404 page is not what you &apos;re looking for .
That &apos;s the 404 feeling .
I mean , I &apos;ve heard about that .
Joey !
Crowd : Whoa !
So this turned into a contest .
Dailypath that offers inspiration put inspiration on their 404 page .
Each one of them found this .
It turned into a 24-hour contest .
This is one that commiserates with you .
This is one that blames you .
This is one that I loved .
Thank you .
Amber Case : We are all cyborgs now
So what &apos;s a good definition for cyborg ?
People aren &apos;t supposed to be there .
So let &apos;s look at the concept of traditional anthropology .
They &apos;re clicking on things and staring at screens . &quot;
What does the inside of your computer actually look like ?
And suddenly we have to start to maintain our second self .
And I said , &quot; Great . &quot;
I thought I was very clever .
And I said , &quot; I want to do that . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Well , okay . &quot;
And I want to make a time machine . &quot;
So I started studying anthropology .
Every single browser tab gives you a different type of time .
So we have this thing called ambient intimacy .
And so there are some psychological effects that happen with this .
They &apos;re not just sitting there .
And so this is very important .
It actually looks very organic .
And it &apos;s not that machines are taking over .
So that &apos;s why I study cyborg anthropology .
Thank you .
Diana Nyad : Extreme swimming with the world &apos;s most dangerous jellyfish
How had I spent my valuable time ?
How could this have gone by like lightning ?
And then my mother died at 82 .
And I &apos;m not in the present whatsoever .
It was deep in my imagination .
No one &apos;s ever done it without a shark cage .
It &apos;s daunting .
And I started to train .
I hadn &apos;t swum for 31 years , not a stroke .
It &apos;s a smiling face .
And I put together an expedition .
The navigation is difficult .
It &apos;s tricky .
And there &apos;s dehydration .
And there &apos;s hypothermia .
And there are sharks .
And there are all kinds of problems .
Are your shoulders ready ?
And they were . They were prepared .
No stone left unturned .
Was the mind ready ?
You &apos;re really left alone with your own thoughts .
You save the French for last .
And it &apos;s odd , isn &apos;t it ?
And I couldn &apos;t wait to trip the mind fantastic .
Is there an edge ?
And I knew I could do it .
First of all , you &apos;re going to hit obstacles .
You &apos;re immersed in the liquid .
Your body doesn &apos;t like the saltwater .
And I was on fire -- excruciating , excruciating pain .
Help me ! Somebody help me ! &quot;
And the next thing is paralysis .
Then come convulsions .
He &apos;s stung .
My breath is down to three breaths a minute .
I need help , and I can &apos;t help Diana . &quot;
So that was at eight o &apos;clock at night .
It was like an ICU unit in the water .
They either die or they quickly get to a hospital .
And the next night at dusk , again , wham !
And I gave in to the staged swim .
And I got back in .
And I swam through that night and into the next day .
And at 41 hours , this body couldn &apos;t make it .
And the dream was crushed .
I &apos;ll just swim right through them .
Well there was no grin and bearing this .
And they have these long 30 to 40 to 50-ft. tentacles .
And they do this wrapping .
And they can send the poison into the system .
And a little kid from the back was like this .
&quot; Henry , what &apos;s your question ? &quot;
He said , &quot; That &apos;s what you need .
I finished the swim like this .
I was swimming with this thing on .
That &apos;s how scared of the jellyfish I was .
So now what do I do ?
Because we &apos;ve all had them , haven &apos;t we ?
We &apos;ve all had a heartache .
Yeah .
Thank you .
But that ocean &apos;s still there .
This hope is still alive .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
And so , what after that ?
Are you going to swim the Atlantic ?
No , that &apos;s the last swim .
It &apos;s the only swim I &apos;m interested in .
But I &apos;m ready .
I said , &quot; Nope . I didn &apos;t know . &quot;
And now I &apos;m going to live to 85 .
I have three more years than I thought .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
Live it large . Live it large .
Liza Donnelly : Drawing on humor for change
I was afraid of womanhood .
I &apos;ve learned to be flexible .
Let me explain .
There were plenty of role models all around us .
Now my mother was different .
And I just ate it up .
I was launched as a cartoonist .
We &apos;re told what shape we &apos;re supposed to be in .
We pass it down from generation to generation .
Humor relies on the traditions of a society .
It takes what we know , and it twists it .
Now what if you put together women and humor ?
I think you can get change .
I grew up not far from here in Washington D.C.
It didn &apos;t work .
My parents got divorced , and my sister was arrested .
But I found my place .
I can &apos;t help it . I live here .
Consequently , we have .
We have amazing antennae .
But I feel blessed to be able to work with them .
Thank you .
Jeff Skoll : My journey into movies that matter
You &apos;ve got a cruel sense of humor , TED .
Hollywood has its rivalries , and the Valley has its rivalries .
But I &apos;m actually here today to tell a story .
It &apos;s a world of peace and prosperity and sustainability .
And I think that &apos;s just a horrible thing .
So I set out in a hurry . I studied engineering .
And needless to say , I was right .
But for me , personally , it was a real change .
Bet on good people doing good things . &quot;
And that really resonated with me .
People today we call social entrepreneurs .
And I wondered who was doing these kinds of films today .
And then of course , there was the other adage .
We want them to actually get involved in the issues .
And much to my surprise , they were noticed .
We ended up with 11 Oscar nominations for these films .
I thought it was a 30 to 50 year problem .
We &apos;ve sent 50,000 DVDs to high school teachers in the U.S.
and it &apos;s really changed the debate on global warming .
It was also a pretty good year for this guy .
We now call Al the George Clooney of global warming .
And for Participant , this is just the start .
Everything we do looks at the major issues in the world .
I &apos;ll quickly talk about a few coming up .
It &apos;s been a real honor . Thank you .
Oh , thank you .
Sebastian Wernicke : 1000 TEDTalks , 6 words
There &apos;s currently over a thousand TEDTalks on the TED website .
I think we have a situation here .
How on earth are you going to spread a thousand ideas ?
And I did a little calculation of this .
Here &apos;s my approach to it all .
Isn &apos;t there something shorter ?
The only question is , how short can you get ?
Or &quot; Living in existential vacuum ; it sucks . &quot;
I actually like that one .
We could have been done by lunch here .
I mean ...
So I thought this was quite worthwhile .
So I would end up paying hundreds of dollars .
I would cut my costs by 90 percent .
He always proves us wrong .
They just had some general comment .
There were others , and I found this quite cheeky .
I don &apos;t know any TEDTalk that contains this .
Here are some of my favorites .
So here I was .
It &apos;s a huge list .
Again , there were some misunderstandings .
I mean that &apos;s the essence of it all .
So I had 50 overall summaries done .
Thank you very much .
Underwater astonishments
There &apos;s a flying turkey under a tree .
I &apos;m a geologist by training . But I love that .
And a lot of what goes on inside ...
there &apos;s a fish with glowing eyes , pulsating eyes .
Just absolutely amazing , every single dive .
Tough thing to do .
And the male ... We &apos;re going to see it again .
And there he is , his droopy little eyes up here .
But they can do pretty amazing things , too .
Disappears right into the background .
Positively amazing . Here &apos;s two males fighting .
That &apos;s an amazing thing .
Here &apos;s some algae in the foreground ...
That big brown makes his eyespot very big .
Watch the skin color ; watch the skin texture .
One , two , three .
Theo Jansen : My creations , a new form of life
Theo Jansen is working hard on this evolution .
Evolution has generated many species .
This is the Animaris Currens Ventosa .
I could show you this animal .
Thank you .
In fact , it &apos;s a new invention of the wheel .
It works the same as a wheel .
It &apos;s 3.2 tons .
And this is working on the stored winds in the bottles .
Can I have the feeler here ?
OK . Good .
And it must feel the water of the sea .
And this is the water feeler .
So imagine that the animal is walking towards the sea .
Here , we have the brain of the animal .
It &apos;s a binary step counter .
Thank you .
One of the biggest enemies are the storms .
And the nose is fixed , the whole animal is fixed .
I still have to help them a lot .
Thank you very much , ladies and gentlemen .
JD Schramm : Break the silence for suicide attempt survivors
From all outward appearances , John had everything going for him .
Remarkably -- no , miraculously -- he lived .
And that &apos;s actually where our story begins .
I know John &apos;s story very well because I &apos;m John .
As the Trevor Project says , it gets better .
It gets way better .
It &apos;s a conversation worth having and an idea worth spreading .
Thank you .
Pankaj Ghemawat : Actually , the world isn &apos;t flat
before we think about where we go from here .
So let &apos;s start off with plain old telephone service .
Pick a percentage in your own mind .
The answer turns out to be two percent .
Or let &apos;s turn to people moving across borders .
Again , please pick a percentage .
Turns out to be a little bit higher .
It &apos;s actually about three percent .
What percentage of that was accounted for by foreign direct investment ?
Not quite ten percent .
So clearly , apocalyptically-minded authors have overstated the case .
First of all , there is a suggestion of some error .
Okay .
A couple of different reasons come to mind .
So dearth of data in the debate is one reason .
A second reason has to do with peer pressure .
The perspective was , here is this poor professor .
The answer is probably somewhere between 10 to 15 percent .
Which brings me to my second point .
Think of France and the current debate about immigration .
Bono : The good news on poverty
That &apos;s an Englishman asking an Irishman to be succinct .
So , yeah .
And the Pharaoh replies , &quot; Oh , no .
You , your miserableness , have got to be kidding . &quot;
This time it &apos;s called the Facebook .
Crowds are gathered in Tahrir Square .
So exit the rock star .
Enter the evidence-based activist , the factivist .
Look at what &apos;s been achieved .
Look at the pictures these data sets print .
Wow . Wow .
Seven thousand kids a day . Here &apos;s two of them .
This fantastic news didn &apos;t happen by itself .
Give it up for that .
Halved . Halved .
There &apos;s still work to do .
But it &apos;s heart-stopping . It &apos;s mind-blowing stuff .
This is everything .
Can &apos;t be true , can it ?
We do love a good baseline .
That &apos;s amazing .
So the pride of lions is the proof of concept .
There are all kinds of benefits to this .
How about that ?
And 2028 , 2030 ? It &apos;s just around the corner .
I hope . I &apos;m hoping .
Makes us look really young .
So why aren &apos;t we jumping up and down about this ?
Look at this graph .
And the next one is really beautiful .
It &apos;s called momentum .
So inertia versus momentum .
But you can do something about that .
You can do something about that too .
But there &apos;s a vaccine for that too .
Daylight , you could call it , transparency .
And technology is really turbocharging this .
This is exciting stuff .
Once you have this knowledge , you can &apos;t un-know it .
It &apos;s transformational .
It &apos;s not going to kill you .
In fact , it could save countless lives .
Because as is obvious , factivists have feelings too .
I &apos;m thinking of Wael Ghonim , though .
Wael is right .
Thank you .
Thank you so much .
Jason Fried : Why work doesn &apos;t happen at work
But let &apos;s , sort of , start at the beginning .
And so these companies , they build offices .
It seems like it &apos;s perfectly reasonable to ask that .
Typically you get three different kinds of answers .
So here &apos;s some examples .
You almost never hear someone say the office .
What is that about ?
Why is that ?
Why is that happening ?
That &apos;s what happens at the office .
Then you have something else to do .
I mean , we &apos;ve all been through this .
I was at work .
I sat at my desk . I used my expensive computer .
I used the software they told me to use .
I went to these meetings I was asked to go to .
I did these conference calls . I did all this stuff .
But I didn &apos;t actually do anything .
I just did tasks .
I didn &apos;t actually get meaningful work done .
How about seven hours ?
Six ? Five ? Four ?
Two hours ? One , maybe ?
That &apos;s not really what I mean .
I don &apos;t think anyone would say yes .
And I &apos;m one of these managers .
I understand . I know how this goes .
We all have to improve on this sort of thing .
But oftentimes they &apos;ll cite distractions .
&quot; I can &apos;t let someone work at home .
Because those are voluntary distractions .
You decide when you want to be distracted by the TV .
You decide when you want to turn something on .
So let &apos;s go through a couple of those .
That &apos;s kind of ridiculous . It &apos;s a total decoy .
Those aren &apos;t the real problems in the office .
Those are the real problems in the modern office today .
That &apos;s kind of bad .
It doesn &apos;t work that way .
I don &apos;t care what you &apos;re doing .
What if they &apos;re thinking about something important ?
What if they &apos;re doing important work ?
Because meetings aren &apos;t work .
But meetings also procreate .
You don &apos;t schedule an eight-hour meeting with Outlook .
These things don &apos;t exist outside of the office .
So I have some suggestions to remedy the situation .
I have three suggestions I &apos;ll share with you guys .
I have about three minutes , so that &apos;ll fit perfectly .
We &apos;ve all heard of the casual Friday thing .
I don &apos;t know if people still do that .
But how about &quot; no-talk Thursdays ? &quot;
So just the afternoon , one Thursday .
Just silence , that &apos;s it .
It &apos;s better than a computer .
And maybe , hopefully you can do it more often .
You can quit I.M. ; you can &apos;t hide your manager .
Because work , like sleep , happens in phases .
Just don &apos;t have it .
And you &apos;ll find out that everything will be just fine .
And I think it &apos;ll all pay off in the end .
So thanks for listening .
Dianna Cohen : Tough truths about plastic pollution
And I thought , &quot; Great .
It &apos;s ephemeral just like us . &quot;
It &apos;s plastic pollution .
What is the reality of that ?
So this is a big issue for us .
Whenever possible , refuse single-use and disposable plastics .
Alternatives exist ; some of them are very old-school .
So whenever possible , to choose alternatives to single-use plastics .
Thank you .
Jay Walker : The world &apos;s English mania
Let &apos;s talk about manias .
Manias can be good .
Manias can be alarming .
Or manias can be deadly .
The world has a new mania .
A mania for learning English .
Listen as Chinese students practice their English by screaming it .
Teacher : ... change my life !
Students : I will change my life .
T : I don &apos;t want to let my parents down .
S : I don &apos;t want to let my parents down .
T : Most importantly ... S : Most importantly ...
T : I don &apos;t want to let myself down .
S : I don &apos;t want to let myself down .
Two billion of them .
Students : A t-shirt . A dress .
Why English ? In a single word : Opportunity .
Imagine a student taking a giant test for three full days .
Her score on this one test literally determines her future .
She studies 12 hours a day for three years to prepare .
25 percent of her grade is based on English .
Teacher : Perfect ! Students : Perfect !
T : Perfect ! S : Perfect !
T : I want to speak perfect English .
S : I want to speak perfect English .
T : I want to change my life !
S : I want to change my life !
JW : So is English mania good or bad ?
English is the world &apos;s second language .
Your native language is your life .
The world has other universal languages .
Mathematics is the language of science .
Music is the language of emotions .
And now English is becoming the language of problem-solving .
So English mania is a turning point .
Thank you very much .
Hello , Doha . Hello . Salaam alaikum .
Yeah ? And then a Swedish guy showed me my room .
I said , &quot; Where are the Qataris ? &quot;
&quot; They know . &quot;
And then we sat there for two minutes .
I &apos;m working already . &quot;
Any Lebanese by applause ? Lebanese .
Yeah . The Middle East is going crazy .
Who would have thought ? Oh my gosh .
No . There &apos;s serious issues in the region .
Every country is different and it &apos;s confusing , okay ?
I was in Lebanon , I got used to three .
I &apos;m going to be all right . &quot;
Qataris , you guys do the nose to nose .
I need to rest . &quot;
There &apos;s so much , we laugh , right ?
Maybe like an evil -- like , &quot; Wuhahaha , wuhahaha .
We like to laugh . We like to celebrate life .
Never &quot; Hi , Jack . &quot;
&quot; &#91; Imitating Arabic &#93; -- rainbow ! &quot;
&quot; &#91; Imitating Arabic &#93; -- Tutti Frutti ! &quot;
Thank you very much . Have a good night .
Thank you , TED .
Handspring Puppet Co . : The genius puppetry behind War Horse
AK : The ancestor of the horse .
Okay , we &apos;ll do something with it .
Hahahaha .
So it needed a very articulate front paw .
But , like all puppets , it has other attributes .
AK : Haa haa haaa .
BJ : Breath is really important for us .
BJ : From an actor .
Puppets always have to try to be alive .
And in a way that &apos;s a metaphor for life .
BJ : Okay so .
BJ : His mother was a puppeteer .
I really thought they were so beneath me .
BJ : And here again , you see the same structure .
And he &apos;s controlling the ear movement .
AK : It seemed a lovely idea .
But they agreed to go along with it for a while .
So we began with a test .
So we made a model .
BJ : And the two manipulators are inside .
And we had a crate built for it .
It had to be shipped to London .
BJ : About 40 people .
AK : We were terrified .
It had by no means got the green light yet .
And so the show was given the green light .
Here is the plan .
The horses are completely handmade .
There is very little 20th century technology in them .
And now we would like to introduce you to Joey .
Joey boy , you there ?
Joey .
Joey .
Joey , come here .
No , no , I haven &apos;t got it .
He &apos;s got it ; it &apos;s in his pocket .
BJ : Joey .
AK : Joey , Joey , Joey , Joey .
Come here . Stand here where people can see you .
Move around . Come on .
Here , Craig is working the head .
But he also controls the head directly by using his hand .
Horses &apos; hearing is very important .
It &apos;s almost more important than their eyesight .
He &apos;s working the leg .
Horses are so unpredictable .
The hind legs have got the same action .
AK : You want to say something about the breathing ?
BJ : We had a big challenge with breathing .
AK : Other emotional stuff .
You see the skeletal structure of it .
Again , that was a practical consideration .
It &apos;s three heads making one character .
And plant .
Thank you .
AK : Mikey Brett from Leicestershire .
Thank you . Thank you .
Amy Webb : How I hacked online dating
I don &apos;t understand why this keeps happening .
So I asked everybody in my life what they thought .
You &apos;ve got to date around .
I am constantly swimming in numbers and formulas and charts .
So that wasn &apos;t going to work .
So again , I started doing some math .
Population of Philadelphia : It has 1.5 million people .
That &apos;s only 2.3 percent of the population .
Are the families going to get along ?
What &apos;s the rabbi going to say ?
Are they going to start having children right away ?
So I decided to sign on .
Now , there was one small catch .
But that actually wasn &apos;t the biggest problem .
So I just copied and pasted from my résumé .
I talked a lot about JavaScript .
There was this guy Steve , the I.T. guy .
And listen , I &apos;m a modern woman .
I am totally down with splitting the bill .
But then Steve the I.T. guy didn &apos;t come back .
And that was my entire month &apos;s rent .
And they say to me , &quot; Stop complaining . &quot;
&quot; You &apos;re just being too picky . &quot;
There were just bad for me .
Do you like horror films or romance films ?
I &apos;m not looking for a pen pal .
I &apos;m looking for a husband . Right ?
So there &apos;s a certain amount of superficiality in that data .
So I said fine , I &apos;ve got a new plan .
These things were also important to me but not necessarily deal-breakers .
Well , as it turns out , this worked pretty well .
So I go back online now .
And I thought , I &apos;ve done it !
I &apos;ve cracked the code .
Who are all of the other women on these dating sites ?
I found SmileyGirl1978 .
She listed her job as teacher .
She said she is &quot; silly , nice and friendly . &quot;
She likes to make people laugh &quot; alot . &quot;
So I created 10 fake male profiles .
I didn &apos;t carry on crazy Catfish-style relationships with anybody .
I really was just scraping their data .
But I didn &apos;t want everybody &apos;s data .
So I didn &apos;t reach out to any woman first .
And as it turns out , content matters a lot .
Also , optimistic language matters a lot .
And finally , there were the photos .
All of the women who were popular showed some skin .
I was the most popular person online .
How soon are you going out ? &quot;
He talked in detail about travel .
He made a lot of really interesting cultural references .
It was enough for a date .
In fact , it &apos;s something that you write yourself .
Now , your matzoh balls .
They should be fluffy , not hard . &quot;
And I &apos;ll take her advice on that .
Richard Seymour : How beauty feels
But I felt something .
And it was a physiological response .
Now you probably know the answer to this already .
Remember that ?
I remember it clearly .
I remember sitting there thinking , this is fantastic .
I thought , well what the hell &apos;s that about ?
So I started to ask myself questions about it .
I thought , well that &apos;s not good enough .
And so I did some experiments .
Do you know what it is ? Anyone ?
And this isn &apos;t a think , it &apos;s a feel .
And would you do me a favor ?
I felt a sense of relaxation tempered with anticipation .
I get a sense of anticipation &quot; ?
Now I &apos;m not a neuroscientist .
But it might be .
Everybody likes it , but some like it more than others .
They arrive first .
So how do we make that actually work ?
This is one of the most beautiful things I know .
It &apos;s a plastic bag .
Look at that . What are you feeling about it ?
Is it beautiful ? Is it exciting ?
I &apos;m watching your faces very carefully .
Maybe there &apos;s an innocence to it .
Look at that picture .
Look at the innocence . Look at the beauty in it .
Is it beautiful now ?
Stop . Stop . How do you feel ?
Where are you feeling this ?
I &apos;m feeling it here . I feel it here .
The lady over there is actually crying , by the way .
But what are you doing ?
I watch what people do .
I watch faces .
I watch reactions .
Because I have to know how people react to things .
It &apos;s not a &quot; this is wonderful ! &quot;
That &apos;s not the expression of joy .
There &apos;s something else in that .
There &apos;s something weird happening .
Poignancy is a word I love as a designer .
It isn &apos;t just about nice .
And that &apos;s packed in there as well .
So a lot of it tends to be extrinsic .
It &apos;s mediated by information before the comprehension .
Well it obviously isn &apos;t .
And they found that it was almost exact coincidence .
So it wasn &apos;t about symmetry .
But they &apos;re both different .
I &apos;m not getting it off the eyebrow .
And this is the F1 MV Agusta .
Ahhhh .
It &apos;s masses and masses of layers .
This is just the bit that protrudes into our physical dimension .
It &apos;s something much bigger .
Layer after layer of legend , sport , details that resonate .
So that &apos;s getting me excited .
And I feel that here .
Titanium lacquer on this .
I can &apos;t tell you how wonderful this is .
I &apos;m really getting into this now .
So it disappears .
Why would you do that ?
So it &apos;s more expensive , but it &apos;s wonderful .
Massimo Tamburini .
We have to deal with it .
And so look at her .
I &apos;ve had to make a bit of a compromise there .
No one &apos;s noticed , have they yet ?
Did you see what I did ?
I moved three things by a millimeter .
Pretty ? Yes .
Beautiful ? Maybe lesser .
So that &apos;s okay , isn &apos;t it ?
Another millimeter ?
No one &apos;s going to notice those split lines and changes .
And only a few people can do it .
And a focus group cannot do it .
And a team rarely can do it .
So all hail to that .
It &apos;s a fantastic example , a simple object .
So we &apos;re going to have a little experiment .
Are you ready ? Okay .
It &apos;s not .
Did you think it was modern ? Yes you did .
That blip , that information , shot into you before that .
So is that wrong ?
But you &apos;re a slave of that first flash .
It wins or loses at that point .
And finally , the layer that I love , of knowledge .
Yeah ?
It &apos;s fantastic , isn &apos;t it ?
Look at that . Do you want to see it again ?
That &apos;s how underpaid younger-aged people have to fold your T-shirt .
You didn &apos;t maybe know it .
But how do you feel about it ?
Form follows function ?
Only sometimes . Only sometimes .
Form is function . Form is function .
Thank you very much .
Tom Thum : The orchestra in my mouth
Wassup .
Thank you very much , TEDx .
Look at this , Mom ! I made it !
We start our journey in the central deserts .
India .
China .
Germany .
Party , party , yeah .
TEDx .
I got way too much time on my hands .
All right boys , take it away .
Thank you . Thank you very much .
Lesley Hazleton : On reading the Koran
Now I did have an advantage .
So I read slowly .
But all is not lost in translation .
Or take the infamous verse about killing the unbelievers .
Only God knows the true meaning .
Old-fashioned Orientalism comes into play here .
Not a swelling breast nor a high bosom in sight .
And that number 72 never appears .
There are no 72 virgins in the Koran .
Paradise is quite the opposite .
It &apos;s not virginity ; it &apos;s fecundity .
It &apos;s plenty .
It &apos;s gardens watered by running streams .
Thank you .
Eddi Reader : &quot; What You &apos;ve Got &quot;
Karen Tse : How to stop torture
He was not a political prisoner .
He was a 12-year-old boy who had stolen a bicycle .
And the third is commitment .
Could we do something for these 93 countries ?
But Cambodia is not alone .
I used to think , well is it Cambodia ?
Or is it other countries ?
But it is in so many countries .
It wasn &apos;t a baby , she was three .
A judge would let her out . &quot;
What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
I said , &quot; I &apos;m gonna copy this . &quot;
Prosecutors were perfectly trained .
Because it sounds big .
And there are many reasons why I believe it &apos;s possible .
We need to systematically implement early access to counsel .
Never going to happen . &quot;
But I &apos;m one . I can do something .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Kim Gorgens : Protecting the brain against concussion
Awwww .
I &apos;ll just say , July .
Zzzzzzip for safety .
Water wings -- an inch of water .
So you can get kind of a feel for this .
So my baby , Vander , is eight years old now .
He &apos;s interested in playing football .
He wants to learn how to ride a unicycle .
So why would I worry ?
It &apos;s what I study . It &apos;s what I treat .
And I know that kids get concussed every year .
Let &apos;s take a look .
So a car accident .
Forty miles an hour into a fixed barrier -- 35 Gs .
In case you missed it , we &apos;ll look again .
So look to the right-hand side of the screen .
What would you say ?
How many Gs ?
Close .
Seventy-two .
Would it be crazy to know , 103 Gs .
The average concussive impact is 95 Gs .
Because I know our brains are resilient .
They &apos;re designed to recover from an injury .
But kids are more vulnerable to brain injury .
So how do we guarantee the safety of our kids ?
How can we 100 percent guarantee the safety of our kids ?
Let me tell you what I &apos;ve come up with .
If only .
She &apos;s totally not kidding . &quot;
So in all seriousness , should my kid play football ?
Should your kid play football ? I don &apos;t know .
But I do know there are three things you can do .
The first : study up .
There are some great resources out there .
The CDC has a program , Heads Up .
It &apos;s at CDC.gov.
Heads Up is specific to concussion in kids .
The second is a resource I &apos;m personally really proud of .
It &apos;s a great place to start if you have questions .
The second thing is : speak up .
Speak up also with coaching staff .
Ask about what kind of protective equipment is available .
What &apos;s the budget for protective equipment ?
How old it is ?
Wear a helmet .
So , should Vander play football ?
Thank you .
Ellen &apos; t Hoen : Pool medical patents , save lives
They were not the only ones .
So there was a bit of a conflict there .
So what has this got to do with this ?
He was told that a cure did not exist .
AIDS had become a chronic disease .
In 2002 , they were facing a different battle .
Luckily , those patents did not exist everywhere .
Today , eight million people have access to antiretroviral drugs .
Thirty-four million are infected with HIV .
People who have access to these drugs stop dying .
And there &apos;s something else .
They also stop passing on the virus .
This is fairly recent science that has shown that .
So what &apos;s the problem ?
Well , things have changed .
First of all , the rules have changed .
So what India did is no longer possible .
Second , the practice of patent-holding companies have changed .
It isn &apos;t only the number of drugs that are patented .
There &apos;s something else that can really scare generic manufacturers away .
This shows you a patent landscape .
This is the landscape of one medicine .
Again , deliberate action is needed .
And we did .
In 2010 , UNITAID established the Medicines Patent Pool for HIV .
That can be generic manufacturers .
It can also be not-for-profit drug development agencies , for example .
There is one key difference with the airplane patent pool .
The Medicines Patent Pool is a voluntary mechanism .
They were forced to do so .
That is something that the Medicines Patent Pool cannot do .
Today , Nelson Otwoma is healthy .
He has access to antiretroviral drugs .
His son will soon be 14 years old .
And this is no longer fantasy .
Already , I &apos;ll give you an example .
This has never been done before .
This has never been seen before .
Thank you .
David Deutsch : Chemical scum that dream of distant quasars
Nowadays this idea has a dramatic name : Spaceship Earth .
But that doesn &apos;t prevent them from both being completely false .
And so what does that look like ? Typical .
What does a typical place in the universe look like ?
That &apos;s how big and how dark the universe is .
And that is how un-typical this place is .
So , the laws of physics have this special property .
Now , our environment is inundated with evidence .
Now actually , that &apos;s just another parochial misconception .
So we &apos;re not in a uniquely hospitable place .
And the controversy is global warming .
At the moment , these things are fringe research .
So take two stone tablets , and carve on them .
Thank you .
Cynthia Schneider : The surprising spread of Idol TV
Well , you probably recognize the first person .
It all begins with enjoyment .
We are late to watch &quot; Afghan Star . &quot;
We are running late .
We must go to watch &quot; Afghan Star . &quot;
Cynthia Schneider : These programs are reaching incredibly deeply into society .
People watch it all over the country also in public places .
Contestants also put themselves forward .
This has opened up the door , particularly for women .
And she &apos;s out there .
But actually , just the opposite is happening .
They don &apos;t sing pop songs , they sing Afghan music .
No small thing .
Thank you .
Bastian Schaefer : A 3D-printed jumbo jet ?
What do we know about the future ?
Difficult question , simple answer : nothing .
We cannot predict the future .
What are the main customers of the future ?
These are the future anthropometrics .
These people have different needs .
We want to be treated as individuals .
So we combined these needs with technology &apos;s themes .
How can we bring more natural light into the airplane ?
So this airplane has no windows anymore , for example .
This will be very different in the future .
It will communicate directly with the passenger in its environment .
So let &apos;s compare the old world with the new world .
So this is a bracket of an A380 crew rest compartment .
This here is an equal bracket for the same purpose .
It follows the design of bone .
The design process is completely different .
Push this idea a little bit forward .
So how does nature build its components and structures ?
And nature builds large skeletons out of it .
And the same approach can be applied to technology as well .
How this looks in particular , you can show it here .
And you &apos;ve got trillions of them .
So how might the airplane of the future look ?
See you in the future . Thank you .
Adam Garone : Healthier men , one moustache at a time
I think the beautiful Malin &#91; Akerman &#93; put it perfectly .
How did Movember start ?
Why hasn &apos;t that made a comeback ?
So my boss wouldn &apos;t let me go and see clients .
Parents would shuffle kids away from us .
We can &apos;t have anything to do with you . &quot;
So my lesson that year was persistence .
Essentially , I &apos;m a mustache farmer .
And my season is November .
Then in early 2007 , a really interesting thing happened .
Bring this campaign to these countries .
So we thought , why not ? Let &apos;s do it .
I &apos;ve heard this before . I know how it goes .
It wasn &apos;t as successful as we thought it would be .
And for us , we have redefined charity .
Our ribbon is a hairy ribbon .
We hand across our brand and our campaign to those people .
And I said , &quot; Okay , that &apos;s interesting . &quot;
Your mom would be so proud . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Thank you for doing Movember . &quot;
And I said , &quot; What &apos;s your Movember story ? &quot;
So now , that guy is getting screened for prostate cancer .
We fund prostate cancer foundations now in 13 countries .
And that &apos;s how we &apos;re redefining the research world .
My name is Adam Garone , and that &apos;s my story .
Thank you .
Simon Sinek : How great leaders inspire action
For example : Why is Apple so innovative ?
And yet , they &apos;re just a computer company .
They &apos;re just like everyone else .
Then why is it that they seem to have something different ?
Why him ?
There &apos;s something else at play here .
About three and a half years ago I made a discovery .
As it turns out , there &apos;s a pattern .
And it &apos;s the complete opposite to everyone else .
I call it the golden circle .
Why ? How ? What ?
Let me define the terms really quickly .
That &apos;s a result . It &apos;s always a result .
What &apos;s your cause ? What &apos;s your belief ?
Why does your organization exist ?
Why do you get out of bed in the morning ?
And why should anyone care ?
Let me give you an example .
They &apos;re beautifully designed , simple to use and user friendly .
Want to buy one ? &quot; &quot; Meh . &quot;
And that &apos;s how most of us communicate .
But it &apos;s uninspiring .
Here &apos;s how Apple actually communicates .
We believe in thinking differently .
We just happen to make great computers .
Want to buy one ? &quot;
All I did was reverse the order of the information .
In fact , they tried .
They &apos;re eminently qualified to make flat screen TVs .
They &apos;ve been making flat screen monitors for years .
Nobody bought one .
Why would you buy an MP3 player from a computer company ?
But we do it every day .
It &apos;s all grounded in the tenets of biology .
Not psychology , biology .
It just doesn &apos;t drive behavior .
This is where gut decisions come from .
Most people don &apos;t know about Samuel Pierpont Langley .
Everybody was trying it .
Money was no problem .
Then how come we &apos;ve never heard of Samuel Pierpont Langley ?
Samuel Pierpont Langley was different .
He was in pursuit of the result .
He was in pursuit of the riches .
And lo and behold , look what happened .
The others just worked for the paycheck .
We found out about it a few days later .
Well , you can trip over 10 percent of the customers .
That &apos;s how we describe them , right ?
It &apos;s because they wanted to be first .
First , the famous failure .
It &apos;s a commercial example .
Look at TiVo .
They were extremely well-funded .
Market conditions were fantastic .
I mean , we use TiVo as verb .
But TiVo &apos;s a commercial failure .
They &apos;ve never made money .
We don &apos;t need it . We don &apos;t like it .
You &apos;re scaring us . &quot;
How do you do that ?
In fact , some of his ideas were bad .
But he had a gift .
He went around and told people what he believed .
How many of them showed up for him ?
Zero .
They showed up for themselves .
We followed , not for him , but for ourselves .
Listen to politicians now , with their comprehensive 12-point plans .
They &apos;re not inspiring anybody .
Because there are leaders and there are those who lead .
Thank you very much .
Inge Missmahl : Bringing peace to the minds of Afghanistan
Jung in Afghanistan -- you get the picture .
War and malnutrition kills people together with hope .
Yet , there is hope .
So , doctors prescribe medication .
Military collect weapons , and depression stays intact .
Why ?
No one can survive alone .
And very often violence is a way to cope with it .
And partly this is already happening .
But let me repeat the words of the woman .
So the key here is empathy .
Somebody has to feel how you felt .
And somebody has to see you and listen to you .
And I started thinking about a counseling program .
But , of course , I needed help and funds .
At that time , it was the head of Caritas Germany .
Eleven thousand people came -- more than that .
And 70 percent regained their lives .
And they are working with me up to today .
We developed a culturally-sensitive psycho-social counseling approach .
This means , certainly , to retrain all health staff .
We wanted to know if what is being done is effective .
And all the symptoms stayed the same or even got worse .
And I would like to share one short vignette .
So I believe this kept me running .
I thank you for your attention .
Brenda Romero : Gaming for understanding
All these things happen to me .
This is one my partner and I worked on .
So this one here , this is the 1980 Olympics .
And so this was just an amazing experience .
So games , it means something more to us .
It absolutely means something more .
So now , just , this is an abrupt transition here .
And this is one of my favorite shots here .
And this is actually from his Degradation series .
Just imagine if that &apos;s a black guy .
Right ? Like , seriously , nobody would do this .
But every other medium does it .
Pause for about 10 seconds .
&quot; Can I play a game , Mommy ? &quot;
And so I happened to have all of these little pieces .
So she &apos;s painting her little families .
This was the boat . It was made quickly obviously .
Nobody wants to go on the Middle Passage . &quot;
&quot; So Daddy could be gone . &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot;
She got it because she spent time with these people .
And so it was just an incredibly powerful experience .
But when this happened , I saw the whole planet .
My history is Irish .
I made another game called Train .
And I also made a game about the Trail of Tears .
This is a game with 50,000 individual pieces .
It &apos;s the same thing .
I &apos;m hoping that I &apos;ll teach culture through these games .
And originally it was a math problem more or less .
Like , here &apos;s the economics of illegal immigration .
I &apos;ll look away from the picture .
Ann Cooper : What &apos;s wrong with school lunches
These are some of my kids with a salad bar .
Everyone says it couldn &apos;t be done .
How do we really change children &apos;s relationship to food ?
That &apos;s my premise .
We &apos;re seeing sick kids get sicker and sicker .
The way we got here is because of big agribusiness .
And then we talk about organic food .
We can &apos;t keep doing that .
You know , it doesn &apos;t work .
And the results of that are kids getting sick .
One of my big soapboxes right now is antibiotics .
Seventy percent -- it &apos;s unbelievable .
And the result of it is , we have diseases .
And that is what the USDA allows in our food supply .
And that has to change , you know .
We cannot believe that they have our best interests at heart .
The antithesis of this whole thing is sustainable food .
That &apos;s what I really try and get people to understand .
It really is just a new idea .
It &apos;s no wonder , you know , we have criminals .
And what &apos;s happening is , we &apos;re getting sick .
We &apos;re getting sick and our kids are getting sick .
It is about what we feed them .
What goes in is what we are .
We really are what we eat .
What &apos;s going to happen to our whole medical system ?
What &apos;s going to happen ?
And it &apos;s because of what we feed them .
You know , we are responsible for what kids eat .
But oops , maybe they &apos;re responsible for what kids eat .
20 billion dollars a year . 10,000 ads most kids see .
And why can they serve that much ?
Why can we have 29-cent Big Gulps and 99-cent double burgers ?
Which is why I say it &apos;s a social justice issue .
Well , this is the food I found 24 months ago .
This is not even food .
Everything came in plastic , in cardboard .
The only kitchen tools my staff had was a box cutter .
The USDA allows this .
The USDA allows all of this stuff .
But this is what most schools serve .
There &apos;s not a strawberry tree or a carrot bush .
Now , in Berkeley , we &apos;ve gone totally fresh .
We &apos;re cooking from scratch every day .
Those are my hands . I get up at 4 a.m.
They &apos;re not going to be smart .
You know what ? They &apos;re just going to be sick .
And these calendars really started to lay out my program .
So this is a typical menu .
This is what we &apos;re serving this week at the schools .
And you see these recipes on the side ?
They do tastings of these ingredients in the gardening classes .
The really tiny hamburger , the really big vegetables .
We have to start changing this .
What are kids learning ? Where is the family time ?
Where is socialization ? Where is discussion ?
Where is learning to talk ?
You know , we have to change it .
EATWISE -- Enlightened and Aware Teens Who Inspire Smart Eating .
We have recycling in all of our schools .
One of the things I do a lot is public-private partnerships .
Schools are underfunded .
That comes down to under five dollars an hour .
We really need to change it .
It &apos;s going to take more money .
It &apos;s sort of this &quot; duh &quot; thing .
We need to -- we need to educate .
We need to educate the kids .
We need to educate the staff .
I had 90 employees .
Two were supposed to be cooks -- none could .
But we really have to educate .
That is not lunchtime .
That number probably needs to double .
We spend 100 billion dollars a year on diet aids .
200 billion .
You know what ? We should be ashamed .
We , as a country , should be ashamed at that .
The richest country .
We can all make a difference .
Sit down and care .
Thank you .
Fabian Oefner : Psychedelic science
And yet , they do it in a very different way .
Let me demonstrate this based on three projects .
The first one has to do with making sound visible .
So I came up with the following setup .
Let me show you what this looks like .
Thank you very much .
I agree , it looks pretty amazing .
But I have to tell you a funny story .
Has anyone of you heard of ferrofluid ?
Ah , some of you have . Excellent .
Should I skip that part ?
Ferrofluid has a very strange behavior .
It &apos;s a liquid that is completely black .
It &apos;s got an oily consistency .
Those are just standard watercolors that you would paint with .
That &apos;s because the ferrofluid itself is hydrophobic .
That means it doesn &apos;t mix with the water .
So that was the second project .
Now you might ask yourself , how did he do that ?
And at the same time , alcohol is highly flammable .
Let me demonstrate this over here .
And what I have here is an empty glass vessel .
It &apos;s got nothing in it .
Add some more .
And now , let &apos;s set that on fire .
So that &apos;s all that happens .
It goes really fast , and it &apos;s not that impressive .
So that &apos;s how those images were made .
Thank you .
What &apos;s the idea behind it ?
Is it just a waste of whiskey ?
Is it just some strange materials ?
Thank you very much .
James Flynn : Why our IQ levels are higher than our grandparents&apos;
And our minds have altered , too .
Now this has raised all sorts of questions .
Were our immediate ancestors on the verge of mental retardation ?
Because 70 is normally the score for mental retardation .
Or are we on the verge of all being gifted ?
Because 130 is the cutting line for giftedness .
And initially , that archaeologist would be baffled .
How could these performances have escalated to this enormous degree ?
Well we now know , of course , the answer .
And the fellow said , &quot; Absolutely nothing .
A crow can peck at a fish .
A fish can &apos;t do anything to a crow . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Of course not .
One &apos;s a fish .
The other is a bird . &quot;
Hamburg is a city in Germany .
Are there camels in Hamburg ? &quot;
A third interview was conducted with someone about the North Pole .
Wherever there is always snow , the bears are white .
What color are the bears at the North Pole ? &quot;
They weren &apos;t willing to engage in this .
None of these problems are real .
How can we address them ? &quot;
And let me give you a few illustrations .
You can &apos;t do science without proposing hypotheses .
You can &apos;t do science without making it logically consistent .
And even down in grade school , things have changed .
They put it in Albany rather than New York .
They put it in Harrisburg rather than Philadelphia .
And so forth .
So the tenor of education has changed .
What about employment ?
Only three percent were lawyers or doctors or teachers .
A whole range of professions now make cognitive demands .
The professions have been upgraded .
They went far beyond that 1900 banker .
They had to look at computer projections for the housing market .
Or take a farmer today .
But I &apos;ve talked about education and employment .
I &apos;m primarily a moral philosopher .
But he did have a sense that black people were inferior .
they said that is the dumbest thing you &apos;ve ever said .
How would you feel about that ?
They &apos;re just inherited mores .
Would you deserve to be killed ?
That &apos;s not one of the principles I &apos;ve got .
Well you , today , universalize your principles .
You state them as abstractions and you use logic on them .
It must be that blacks are somehow tainted .
Now how did all of this arise out of I.Q. tests ?
That &apos;s what initially got me going on cognitive history .
And in 1900 , people could do simple analogies .
What are dogs like ?
They would say wolves .
They could say a semicircle .
Now , I should say one thing that &apos;s very disheartening .
We haven &apos;t made progress on all fronts .
They live in the bubble of the present .
But I don &apos;t want to end on a pessimistic note .
As if they were a reptile .
Dan Gilbert : Why we make bad decisions
This is what statisticians technically call a damn fine bet .
Now , let me talk about the first one first .
The reason is , this isn &apos;t how people do odds .
So , for example , here &apos;s a word puzzle .
It &apos;s because the mind recalls words by their first letter .
Compare these to the actual numbers .
It &apos;s not interesting because it &apos;s so common .
Drownings and asthma deaths don &apos;t get much coverage .
Why in the world would anybody ever play the lottery ?
There &apos;s 10 tickets in this lottery .
Nine of them have been sold to these individuals .
Well , Bernoulli tells us it is .
Leroy has nine tickets ; there &apos;s one left .
It &apos;s easy to see Leroy getting the check , right ?
I want to talk now about errors in value .
And this is a systematic error people make .
Imagine that you &apos;re going to the theater .
You &apos;re on your way to the theater .
You also have a 20-dollar bill .
Would you spend your remaining money on replacing it ?
Most people answer , no .
Now , let &apos;s just change one thing in this scenario .
When you arrive you discover you &apos;ve lost one of them .
Would you spend your remaining 20 dollars on a ticket ?
Along the way , you lost something .
In both cases , it was a piece of paper .
What the hell difference should it make ?
Suddenly , we &apos;re almost longing for him to return .
The comparison changes how we evaluate him .
So , they will opt for the item in the middle .
Let me just give you an example .
Of course , what happens when they eat the potato chips ?
Most people say they would .
This kind of thinking drives economists crazy , and it should .
It doesn &apos;t know what you saved it on .
You &apos;ve all had this experience .
This is what we call a one-item IQ test , OK ?
Well , by and large people are enormously impatient .
What do we find now ?
What makes this dynamic inconsistency happen ?
Comparison . Troubling comparison . Let me show you .
These guys can tell us .
However , the difference between them seems to be getting smaller .
Here are the results of what I just showed you .
And I want you to see that two things are true .
Watch what happens when we drop some out .
Suddenly we have the dynamic inconsistency that puzzled us .
I &apos;ll take the 50 dollars now .
Thank you .
That was remarkable .
Talk more about it .
It &apos;s out-sized . I mean , look .
If Australia disappears tomorrow , terror is probably the right response .
Is terror the right response ?
What is it ?
That &apos;s not my point at all .
I think in the case of terrorism , it isn &apos;t .
There are no guns going off .
That &apos;s a tough one .
There &apos;s no question .
People died ; so be it .
And so we evolved these responses .
Is that what happened ?
That &apos;s what you think it is . All right ?
It &apos;s not because she is stupid or he is stupid .
Last question .
For you or for them ?
AdG : In persuading them .
Ah , for you in persuading them .
But these are tricks around the margins .
Richard Wilkinson : How economic inequality harms societies
But first , see what a miserable lot we are .
I want to start though with a paradox .
And it makes no difference to their life expectancy at all .
There &apos;s no suggestion of a relationship there .
This , again , is life expectancy .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to show you .
I &apos;m not using any hypothetical data .
We put them all in one index .
They &apos;re all weighted equally .
It &apos;s an extraordinarily close correlation .
It has 40 different components put together by other people .
Everything goes into it .
Here it is in relation to that same measure of inequality .
Kids do worse in the more unequal societies .
Highly significant relationship .
Here , for instance , is trust .
It comes from the World Values Survey .
I may say , we did all this work twice .
Very similar scatter over a similar range of levels of trust .
Same thing is going on .
We &apos;re not just talking about a fluke .
This is mental illness .
And again , closely related to inequality .
This is violence .
But look at the scale of the differences .
It goes from 15 homicides per million up to 150 .
This is the proportion of the population in prison .
But it goes from about 40 to 400 people in prison .
That relationship is not mainly driven by more crime .
In some places , that &apos;s part of it .
Here we have children dropping out of high school .
Again , quite big differences .
This is social mobility .
It &apos;s actually a measure of mobility based on income .
There &apos;s more social mobility .
I &apos;ve shown you just a few things in italics here .
I could have shown a number of other problems .
Think of the expense , the human cost of that .
Japan is rather different though .
It starts off with much smaller differences in earnings before tax .
It has lower taxes .
It has a smaller welfare state .
This is just one example .
It &apos;s infant mortality .
The biggest differences are at the bottom of society .
It also leads to status insecurity .
The social-evaluative judgments increase , the fear of those social-evaluative judgments .
Now we have been criticized .
Otherwise that would introduce bias .
What about other countries ?
Why don &apos;t we control for other factors ?
What about causality ?
Correlation in itself doesn &apos;t prove causality .
We spend a good bit of time .
Thank you .
Andras Forgacs : Leather and meat without killing animals
What &apos;s crazy is what we do today .
But maintaining this herd takes a major toll on our planet .
Animals are not just raw materials .
And we should begin by reimagining leather .
I emphasize leather because it is so widely used .
It is also less polarizing for consumers and regulators .
Now how do we do it ?
This takes millions of cells and expands them into billions .
This collagen is the stuff between cells .
It &apos;s natural connective tissue .
This is real , genuine leather , without the animal sacrifice .
And this leather is 21 layers thick and quite opaque .
What could the future of animal products look like ?
Rather , it could be much more like this .
A brewery is essentially a bioreactor .
It is where cell culture takes place .
Perhaps biofabrication is a natural evolution of manufacturing for mankind .
It &apos;s environmentally responsible , efficient and humane .
It allows us to be creative .
Perhaps we are ready for something literally and figuratively more cultured .
Thank you .
Nick Sears : Demo : The Orb
We can use LEDs .
Most importantly for this , they &apos;re faster .
The equator &apos;s speed is actually about 60 miles per hour .
But this is really just the beginning .
It achieves this by rotating LEDs about two axes .
These blocks represent LEDs .
So , take a look .
But this piece is due out in May .
There are hundreds of student innovators with fantastic projects .
It &apos;s an honor to be here . Thanks very much .
Adam Ostrow : After your final status update
Here &apos;s what he wrote in starting that out .
Consider a few stats for a moment .
There are 200 million Tweets being posted every day .
Adam Ostrow : Hello .
Death : Adam ?
AO : Yeah .
AO : Who is this ?
Death : Go to ifidie.net before it &apos;s too late .
Adam Ostrow : Kind of creepy , right ?
Another service right now is called 1,000 Memories .
But what I think comes next is far more interesting .
Now we &apos;re already starting to see some experiments here .
Thank you very much .
Jehane Noujaim : My wish : A global day of film
And I know what you &apos;re thinking .
She &apos;s not . She &apos;s at the TED Prize .
Wow ! Some of you watched it .
That &apos;s great . That &apos;s great .
This is Donna .
This is Donna at the Statue of Liberty .
This is Donna eating ice cream .
So we &apos;re not forcing people to travel .
So I &apos;m the living product of two cultures coming together .
No pun intended .
And I began to start teaching there .
I taught English , and I met some incredible women there .
So I was 18 ; I was very excited .
And as I sat there , I got very depressed .
And I just saw the power of the image .
And it was incredible .
And so that &apos;s what really kind of started me off .
So I knew that I had to go there .
I just wanted to be in the center .
I had no plan . I had no funding .
I didn &apos;t even have a camera at the time .
I &apos;ve got to go see what this is all about .
Sameer Khader : Business as usual .
Iraq , and then Iraq , and then Iraq .
To change the Arab nightmare into the American dream .
I still have that dream .
Maybe I will never be able to do it .
But I have plans for my children .
I will pay for their study .
And they will stay there .
And it was revolting .
It was absolutely revolting .
It made me sick to my stomach .
That &apos;s bad . &quot;
And then going away , and probably eating dinner or something .
And it didn &apos;t affect me as much .
It makes me hate war .
We had no funding for it .
He kind of redefined us as an American population .
Al Jazeera offered him a job .
And I saw this with audiences .
How do we understand what the other person is thinking ? &quot;
That &apos;s no sacrifice , that &apos;s revenge !
The difference is that the Israeli military is still stronger .
Then let us be equal in death .
We still have Paradise .
There is no Paradise ! It only exists in your head !
God forbid !
May God forgive you .
If you were not Abu Azzam &apos;s daughter ...
In this life , we &apos;re dead anyway .
One only chooses bitterness when the alternative is even bitterer .
And what about us ? The ones who remain ?
Will we win that way ?
Don &apos;t you see what you &apos;re doing is destroying us ?
And that you give Israel an alibi to carry on ?
So with no alibi , Israel will stop ?
Perhaps . We have to turn it into a moral war .
How , if Israel has no morals ?
Be careful !
Ayelet : What do you know about the casualties ?
We &apos;re looking for three girls .
Tzvika : We have no information .
Are you sure she is dead ? &quot;
They said yes .
And my 12-year-old daughter Christine was killed in the shooting .
I am the headmaster for all parts .
George : But there is a teacher that is in charge ?
Tzvika : Yes , I have assistants .
I deal with children all the time .
George : There were many things that touched me .
I know where you guys are coming from .
Death unto apartheid ! &quot;
It &apos;s about the liberation struggle .
Yes . Yes !
Freedom !
And that &apos;s what this is about .
And that &apos;s an amazing thing .
There &apos;s Witness , that you heard from earlier .
And we started calling up everybody .
And we called that landmass Pangea .
And that &apos;s my wish .
That is an incredible wish .
Pangea Cinema -- the day the world comes together .
Ladies and gentlemen , Jehane Noujaim .
Daniel Libeskind : 17 words of architectural inspiration
You see how resistant it is to those very ideas .
We can think them out . We can create incredible things .
We applaud the well-mannered box .
And I think that &apos;s really what architecture is based on .
It &apos;s based on wonder .
But it is a story of effort and struggle against improbabilities .
So , anything that has been made can be unmade .
Anything that has been made can be made better .
These are the dimensions that I like to work with .
It &apos;s something very personal .
And I therefore believe that optimism is what drives architecture forward .
And it is that belief that I think drives society .
Think of the Empire State Building , the Rockefeller Center .
So again , I am a believer in the expressive .
I have never been a fan of the neutral .
I don &apos;t like neutrality in life , in anything .
I think expression .
That &apos;s what expression is .
And , of course , expressive spaces are not mute .
Expressive spaces may disturb us .
And I think that &apos;s also part of life .
So again , radical versus conservative .
It &apos;s not just a conservation in formaldehyde of dead forms .
So again I am a believer in the radical architecture .
You know the Soviet architecture of that building is the conservation .
It &apos;s like the old Las Vegas used to be .
Therefore I believe it should not be cool .
Life without emotion would really not be life .
Even the mind is emotional .
I think that is the progress of cities .
But architecture is not the language of words .
Hand versus the computer .
Of course , what would we be without computers ?
Our whole practice depends on computing .
It is complex . Space is complex .
And yet , our lives are complex .
Our emotions are complex .
Our intellectual desires are complex .
Of course that means that architecture is political .
The political is not an enemy of architecture .
Because architecture is also the asking of questions .
It &apos;s not only the giving of answers .
Therefore it is important that it be real .
You know we can simulate almost anything .
Unexpected versus habitual .
It &apos;s a self-induced poison .
So the unexpected is always unexpected .
And of course habits are enforced by architecture .
We think the world really looks like our buildings .
So again , the unexpected which is also the raw .
And I often think of the raw and the refined .
And of course buildings have their shapes .
Those shapes are difficult to change .
So that is indeed what is memory .
So I believe that my main interest is to memory .
Without memory we would be amnesiacs .
Without the memory there would be no story to tell .
There would be nowhere to turn .
It &apos;s an art of communication .
It can reach into sources that are not explicitly available .
And these are our dreams .
And of course risk . I think architecture should be risky .
World without risk would not be worth living .
It &apos;s about space . It &apos;s not about fashion .
It &apos;s not about decoration .
It &apos;s about carving out a space for trees .
And I think that is really the nature of architecture .
Now I am a believer in democracy .
I don &apos;t like beautiful buildings built for totalitarian regimes .
Where people cannot speak , cannot vote , cannot do anything .
And of course , at Ground Zero what else ?
It &apos;s such a complex project .
It &apos;s emotional . There is so many interests .
There are emotions of the victims .
I think nothing good will come out of that .
I think architecture is about consensus .
And that is where I end .
This is America . This is liberty .
I &apos;ve got a question .
Not just for New York , but for the world .
Thank you so much , Daniel Libeskind .
Ben Cameron : The true power of the performing arts
I have read the &quot; Twilight &quot; tetralogy .
Whatever we do together is pure invention .
How are they entitled to practice ?
Thank you , and godspeed .
Niels Diffrient : Rethinking the way we sit down
Now I &apos;m talking about the &apos; 30s .
And then mount his airplane , maybe for the last time .
But this was real romance to me .
It &apos;s the way I got a part of this romance .
The product was that airplane .
But it built a romance .
Even the parts of the airplane had French names .
Ze fuselage , ze empanage , ze nessal .
You know , from a romance language .
So that it was something that just got into your spirit .
It did mine .
I wanted to build airplanes .
So I built model airplanes .
You couldn &apos;t transfer those to the model itself .
You had to learn about aeronautics .
I &apos;d wile away my time drawing airplanes in the class .
You should be in the art department . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Why ? &quot;
So my romance was temporarily shifted .
And I went into art because they appreciated drawing .
Studied painting ; didn &apos;t do very well at that .
Went through design , some architecture .
Eventually hired myself out as a designer .
And it exists .
And I quit .
I wanted to get back where the romance was .
So I chose furniture .
And I chose chairs specifically because I knew something about them .
But not office chairs .
So I started doing that .
I conceived the kind of airplane .
I basically engineered it .
I built it .
And I flew it .
And that &apos;s the way I work now .
When I started this chair it was not a preconceived notion .
Now that may not mean a lot to some of you .
There are drawbacks to this .
One is : you can &apos;t accommodate everybody .
They begin to fall off the end of your chart .
They will sit in them forever .
He said she had one of the new , better chairs .
She said , &quot; Oh I love it . &quot;
She said , &quot; But it &apos;s too high . &quot;
He came over and looked at it .
And he showed her the lever .
I had one for a wristwatch once . 20 pages .
So I spent a long time .
I said I worked eight or nine years on it .
And they go up easily .
And stop where you want .
You can put them down , essentially out of the way .
No arms at all .
Or you can pull them up where you want them .
You feel that bone under there ?
Just your own .
There &apos;s two of them , one on either side .
And that &apos;s a lot of load .
And breathability is good .
As I recline , my head says more or less vertical .
So that &apos;s where a headrest comes in .
So here we are .
You cant hit your elbow on bottom .
Tom Chatfield : 7 ways games reward the brain
I love video games .
I &apos;m also slightly in awe of them .
That &apos;s about three times the recorded music industry .
And yet , many of these get built .
On the one hand , there &apos;s the wanting processes .
It &apos;s a really great image . It &apos;s pretty cool .
Because it &apos;s very powerful . It &apos;s pretty awesome .
It gives you great powers .
Your ambition is satisfied , but it &apos;s very beautiful .
It &apos;s a very great pleasure to fly around .
And so these combine to form a very intense emotional engagement .
But this isn &apos;t the really interesting stuff .
Because what you can measure in virtuality is everything .
And this allows something very special to happen in games .
It &apos;s something called the reward schedule .
Simple game quest .
I &apos;ve got to keep opening boxes .
Let &apos;s think about probability .
It keeps people engaged .
That would be very boring .
Fifteen is a pretty optimal number .
But we don &apos;t just have pies in the boxes .
There &apos;s 100 percent up here .
But we don &apos;t just do that either .
And each of these rewards is carefully calibrated to the item .
So all this is very powerful .
But we &apos;re in virtuality . These aren &apos;t real boxes .
So we can do some rather amazing things .
They &apos;re not rational about probability .
They think this game is unfair .
Our games don &apos;t always do this .
So what does all this mean in practice ?
So , you give people lots and lots of different tasks .
Third , you reward effort .
It all feeds in as minute reinforcement .
Fourth , feedback .
It &apos;s very hard to learn , to feel a lesson .
And fifth , the element of uncertainty .
The 25 percent . This lights the brain up .
We just want to go back and find out more .
It &apos;s associated with reward-seeking behavior .
And two things really flow from this .
This can all seem very sinister .
The word &quot; addiction &quot; is thrown around .
There are real concerns there .
But the biggest neurological turn-on for people is other people .
This is what really excites us .
They tracked these on a separate website .
And the success rate is at close to 100 percent .
Let &apos;s start with business .
We can break things down into highly calibrated small tasks .
We can use calculated randomness .
We can reward effort consistently as everything fields together .
Thank you very much .
Matthew Childs : 9 life lessons from rock climbing
Most of them are pretty basic .
Number two : hesitation is bad .
Friction climbing doesn &apos;t have any sort of hard positive edges .
You &apos;re climbing on little dimples and nubbins in the rock .
And then from that point on , you &apos;re basically falling .
So momentum is good . Don &apos;t stop .
Rule number three : have a plan .
This climber is on the last pitch of it .
He &apos;s actually right about where I fell .
There is about 1,000 feet of air below him .
And all the hard pitches are actually below him .
And then what happens ?
You get to the last pitch . It &apos;s easy .
And you &apos;re completely flamed out . Don &apos;t do it .
You have to plan ahead to get to the top .
So you &apos;ve got to focus .
You &apos;ve got to keep going .
Rule number five : know how to rest .
This is a climb in the Needles , again in California .
Rule number eight : strength doesn &apos;t always equal success .
And of course there is rule number nine .
So don &apos;t hang on till the bitter end .
Thank you very much .
Jim Fallon : Exploring the mind of a killer
So that &apos;s what I normally do .
And so this would be the typical talk I would give .
So I &apos;ve looked at about 70 of these .
And what came up was a number of pieces of data .
It &apos;s really a very precisely timed thing .
You get different kinds of psychopaths .
They had other sorts of brain damage .
Some of you have this . And it &apos;s sex-linked .
So this is how it &apos;s passed from mother to son .
And it does have some consequences .
Right ? That &apos;s how the mirror neuron system works .
Well what the problem is this tends to concentrate these genes .
And now the boys and the girls get them .
So that was the idea .
She then told me about our own family tree .
Okay , so that &apos;s the first case of matricide .
But it doesn &apos;t stop there .
Okay , now this gives one a little pause .
But more likely is this .
And they all seemed to be OK .
But our grandkids are going to be kind of concerned here .
They have the same brain , and the same EEG .
And now they are close as can be .
But there &apos;s gonna be bad news somewhere .
So that &apos;s my talk .
Robert Gordon : The death of innovation , the end of growth
That &apos;s how we traveled in the year 1900 .
That &apos;s an open buggy . It doesn &apos;t have heating .
It doesn &apos;t have air conditioning .
That &apos;s a Boeing 707 .
Some of the reasons for this are not really very controversial .
They &apos;re demographics , education , debt and inequality .
They &apos;re powerful enough to cut growth in half .
So we need a lot of innovation to offset this decline .
Now here &apos;s eight centuries of economic growth .
The white line is for the U.K. , and then the U.S.
Then growth gets better and better .
But you know what the actual facts are ?
Negative .
This led to a fantasy .
Well , it &apos;s a matter of arithmetic .
Two-percent growth quadruples your standard of living in 70 years .
That means we &apos;d go from 44,000 to 180,000 .
The first headwind is demographics .
But now it &apos;s turned around .
The next headwind is education .
We have a lot of debt .
All the rest went to the top one percent .
So that brings us down to 0.8 .
And that 0.8 is the big challenge .
Are we going to grow at 0.8 ?
So let &apos;s see what some of those inventions were .
By 1929 , electric light was everywhere .
We had the vertical city , the invention of the elevator .
Central Manhattan became possible .
Electricity was also very helpful in liberating women .
They did it on a scrub board .
Then they had to hang the clothes out to dry .
Then they had to bring them in .
The whole thing took two days out of the seven-day week .
And then we had the electric washing machine .
And by 1950 , they were everywhere .
The bedrooms were cold . They were unheated .
And I &apos;ll just give you a few examples .
Urban environments make people more productive than on the farm .
What about the electronic revolution ?
Here &apos;s an early computer .
It &apos;s amazing . The mainframe computer was invented in 1942 .
But I &apos;m now going to give you an experiment .
You have to choose either option A or option B.
So here we are back to the horse and buggy .
Your challenge is , can you match what we achieved ?
Thank you .
Derek Sivers : How to start a movement
But what he &apos;s doing is so easy to follow .
Now , notice that the leader embraces him as an equal .
Now , there he is calling to his friends .
It takes guts to stand out like that .
And here comes a second follower .
So a movement must be public .
Now we &apos;ve got momentum . This is the tipping point .
Now we &apos;ve got a movement .
And that &apos;s how you make a movement .
But let &apos;s recap some lessons from this .
Okay , but we might have missed the real lesson here .
And what a perfect place to do that , at TED .
Thanks .
Mark Pagel : How language transformed humanity
Languages are genes talking , getting things that they want .
Why not ? I mean , that &apos;s what we do .
Now this may sound arrogant , or even full of hubris .
How do we know this ?
You can follow it through the fossil record .
But by comparison , we can learn .
We can benefit from others &apos; ideas .
We can build on their wisdom .
And all of this because of cumulative cultural adaptation .
Social learning really is visual theft .
And small groups are more prone to accidents and bad luck .
Language evolved to solve the crisis of visual theft .
Now you pursue this guy , gesticulating .
We &apos;ll do that . &quot;
Now the job is done .
And this is exactly what the archeological record shows .
Language really is the most potent trait that has ever evolved .
Language really is the voice of our genes .
Now you might say , well , this is just natural .
As we diverge , our languages are naturally going to diverge .
And he said to me , &quot; Oh no .
They &apos;re far closer together than that . &quot;
And this is also true of some remote oceanic islands .
They slow the flow of technologies .
And they even slow the flow of genes .
This remarkable image is not a map of the world .
In fact , it &apos;s a map of Facebook friendship links .
And they impose a barrier to cooperation .
Now think of the absurdity of this situation .
The European Union employs a permanent staff of about 2,500 translators .
One of them always drives the other extinct .
And we see this in the inexorable march towards standardization .
Thank you .
Matt Ridley : Mark , one question .
Mark Pagel : This is a very good question .
But that doesn &apos;t tell us they necessarily had language .
MR : Thank you very much indeed .
Chris Jordan : Turning powerful stats into art
And that &apos;s what I look at with my photographic work .
They just don &apos;t do that in that industry .
That &apos;s 15 minutes of our cup consumption .
And there &apos;s an hour &apos;s worth of our cups .
And there &apos;s a day &apos;s worth of our cups .
You can still see the little people way down there .
And I wanted to show the number .
The number is 2.3 million Americans were incarcerated in 2005 .
And this particular one is about cigarette addiction .
And do you remember the response ?
It will be something that we talk about in 100 years .
And every single day since then , 1,100 Americans have died .
And today , 1,100 Americans are dying from cigarette smoking .
And we aren &apos;t talking about it -- we dismiss it .
The tobacco lobby , it &apos;s too strong .
We just dismiss it out of our consciousness .
And this is what the next piece is about .
A strange phenomenon .
Now , I want to emphasize that these are just examples .
I &apos;m not holding these out as being the biggest issues .
They &apos;re just examples .
There &apos;s this kind of anesthesia in America at the moment .
They &apos;ve gone missing ; these feelings have gone missing .
We can &apos;t make meaning out of these enormous statistics .
Thank you and good afternoon .
Seth Berkley : HIV and flu -- the vaccine strategy
Do you worry about what is going to kill you ?
Heart disease , cancer , a car accident ?
But what really threatens humanity ?
Are we safer today ?
We can do this .
So , I &apos;m here to trumpet vaccines for you .
Or polio ? How many of you remember the iron lung ?
We don &apos;t see scenes like this anymore because of vaccines .
Why is that ?
Well , here &apos;s the dirty little secret .
We knew they worked through old-fashioned trial and error .
So let &apos;s explore how vaccines work .
So that &apos;s really how vaccines work .
These memory cells immediately deploy the exact weapons needed .
The virus is defeated .
Seth Berkley : Really cool video , isn &apos;t it ?
So let &apos;s take a look at the flu virus .
Now let &apos;s take a look at HIV .
The vaccine effort though is really quite different .
Now , what does this mean ?
So what we &apos;ve got is a situation .
So think of it this way .
And that would create a universal HIV vaccine .
Let me give you another example .
Notice these other , smaller protuberances .
These are largely hidden from the immune system .
So I want you to think back a few months ago .
Vaccines were promised to developing countries .
So what happened ?
So today , we get our flu vaccines from ...
chicken eggs , hundreds of millions of chicken eggs .
Almost nothing has changed .
So , here &apos;s an alarming thought .
What if that wild bird flies by again ?
And the process still takes more than half a year .
So are we better prepared than we were in 1918 ?
With a range of new technologies , we could .
Now think of where this leads us .
New infectious diseases appear or reappear every few years .
Will we be quick enough to react before millions die ?
Luckily , this year &apos;s flu was relatively mild .
No longer does AIDS need to kill two million a year .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Thank you .
So , the science is changing .
So , the challenge is full speed ahead .
You also can use adjuvants , which are chemicals you mix .
And malaria &apos;s even further behind ?
The world needs people like you . Thank you .
SB : Thank you .
Graham Hawkes : A flight through the ocean
We still have one foot in the dark ages .
This is an ocean planet .
So I have one message .
And it &apos;s all a question of perspective .
Well , it &apos;s the relative importance .
It &apos;s a thin film , two-dimensional existence .
The ocean representation would have a depth to it .
That means that us terrestrials occupy a minority .
Because it &apos;s a problem we have .
Okay . Let me criticize this thing .
This is an acryclic sphere .
Also coming up later for criticism are these massive lights .
And this one actually carries two great manipulators .
You notice that Jim Cameron is sitting in a seat .
Now , go into the real atmosphere of this planet .
Most of life on earth is in that inner atmosphere .
Fish do not sit in seats .
They don &apos;t fall over . They don &apos;t fall .
It &apos;s truly a three-dimensional space .
And we &apos;re only just beginning to grasp it .
This is the way we should be going into the oceans .
This is a three-dimensional machine .
OK , this is good stuff .
This is man &apos;s first attempt at flying underwater .
She has twice the wingspan that I do .
There I &apos;m coming ; she sees me .
I put reverse thrust and I try and pull gently down .
I &apos;m trying to do everything very gently .
And this ballet is controlled by this lady here .
She gets about that close and then she pulls away .
This was a fly by wire . It has wings .
She just rolled right away from underneath .
It took 10 years to build .
I just had to go and build another machine .
This is an internal Sony camera . Thank you , Sony .
Now , there she goes , right overhead .
This is a wide-angle camera .
I come back up , not for air .
Okay , can we cut that ? Lights back up please .
It was the fact she was going so slow .
She wanted to dance .
You see the larger wing area here .
So we opened the world &apos;s first flight school .
&quot; I write these stinking license , &quot; which I do .
They &apos;re one of the first subsea aviators .
So we &apos;ve run two flight schools .
We &apos;ve decided we &apos;re just going to let that go .
The other thing is that we &apos;ve got much lower costs .
Thank you .
Sunitha Krishnan : The fight against sex slavery
I &apos;m talking to you about modern-day slavery .
Shaheen &apos;s background I don &apos;t even know .
They are sold in the name of adoption .
They are sold in the name of organ trade .
I work on the issue of commercial sexual exploitation .
And I tell you stories from there .
I was 15 when I was gang-raped by eight men .
I never felt like a victim , then or now .
And that &apos;s what we do to all traffic survivors .
Where does their journey begin ?
You have even the middle class sometimes getting trafficked .
These people are deceived , forced .
99.9 percent of them resist being inducted into prostitution .
Some pay the price for it .
They &apos;re killed ; we don &apos;t even hear about them .
They are voiceless , &#91; unclear &#93; , nameless people .
And we are silent about them .
We think it is easy money .
We think it is shortcut .
We think the person likes to do what she &apos;s doing .
And therefore she starts normalizing this exploitation .
And it &apos;s abnormal to live in a shelter .
It &apos;s abnormal to get rehabilitated .
It &apos;s in that context that I work .
It &apos;s in that context that I rescue children .
Because I had lots of them who were already HIV infected .
One third of the people I rescue are HIV positive .
And for me , I was my greatest experience .
You see a girl here who is trained as a welder .
She earns around 12,000 rupees .
Why welding and why not computers ?
What has been my challenge ?
My challenge has not been the traffickers who beat me up .
I can &apos;t hear from my right ear .
My biggest challenge is society .
It &apos;s you and me .
And there is a long pause .
But it is not nice to bring them to our homes .
There it ends .
That &apos;s my biggest challenge .
They need your compassion .
They need your empathy .
They need , much more than anything else , your acceptance .
Can you break your culture of silence ?
Can you speak to at least two persons about this story ?
Can you just encompass these people too ?
Because they are also a part of us .
They are also part of this world .
They died of AIDS last year .
Thank you .
Yasheng Huang : Does democracy stifle economic growth ?
My topic is economic growth in China and India .
One simple answer is China has Shanghai and India has Mumbai .
Look at the skyline of Shanghai .
This is the Pudong area .
You &apos;re being constrained by the public &apos;s opinion .
Even Prime Minister Manmohan Singh agrees with that view .
You cannot be constrained by the public &apos;s opinion .
Here &apos;s the key question .
Just how important are infrastructures for economic growth ?
This is a key issue .
Country 1 has a systematic advantage over Country 2 in infrastructures .
They must have done better , in terms of economic growth .
And Country 2 is possibly India . &quot;
That &apos;s not too good .
The picture there is Khrushchev .
Telephones , infrastructures do not guarantee you economic growth .
Country 2 , that has fewer telephones , is China .
And Country 2 is China .
This is a very little known fact about the two countries .
Yes , today China has a huge infrastructure advantage over India .
And this is clearly the story of the Chinese economic growth .
Let me look at this question more directly .
Is democracy bad for economic growth ?
Both countries are in Asia .
And which one is a democracy ? &quot;
And it &apos;s very common that we compare India with China .
But the more natural comparison is actually between India and Pakistan .
Those two countries are geographically similar .
They have a complicated , but shared common history .
So why do economists fall in love with authoritarian governments ?
One reason is the East Asian Model .
Korea succeeded , North Korea didn &apos;t .
Taiwan succeeded , China under Mao Zedong didn &apos;t .
Burma didn &apos;t succeed .
The Philippines didn &apos;t succeed .
So exactly why did China grow so much faster ?
China was during the Cultural Revolution .
So that &apos;s when China was mad .
The whole country went mad .
And this is the earliest data that I can find .
I haven &apos;t told you about the definition of literacy .
So you have to always think carefully about these decisions .
This is an extremely strange fact .
So India is reverting to the normal .
In China , it &apos;s all women .
Then the issue is , what about the Chinese political system ?
What about the political system ?
Actually , the answer is more nuanced and subtle than that .
They have increased the security of proprietors .
And they have increased the security with long-term land leases .
There are also financial reforms in rural China .
There is also a rural entrepreneurial revolution in China .
You can apply exactly the same dynamic perspective on India .
Indira Gandhi declared emergency rule in 1975 .
The Indian government owned and operated all the TV stations .
One reason is they are always comparing India with China .
But China is a superstar in terms of economic growth .
Comparing with a superstar is the wrong benchmark .
This is a very impressive record indeed .
Which country has the growth momentum ?
But I believe that India has the momentum .
It has the improving fundamentals .
Thank you very much .
Yoav Medan : Ultrasound surgery -- healing without cuts
And this is what I &apos;ll tell you about .
So let &apos;s first talk about focused ultrasound .
And I hold in my hand a tissue-mimicking phantom .
It is made out of silicon .
It is transparent , made just for you .
So you see , it &apos;s all intact , completely transparent .
I &apos;ll take you now to the acoustic lab .
You see the phantom within the aquarium .
This is a setup I put in a physics lab .
On the right-hand side , you see an ultrasonic transducer .
Okay , so everything around it is whole and intact .
It &apos;s just a lesion formed inside .
So think about , this is in your brain .
We need to reach a target inside the brain .
We can do it without harming any tissue .
You know all about imaging , right , ultrasound imaging .
And you know also about lithotripsy -- breaking kidney stones .
He failed , so he then invented the gammaknife .
And it makes you ponder why those pioneers failed .
And there was something fundamental that they were missing .
They were missing the vision .
This is an MR suite with a focused ultrasound system .
And I will give you several examples .
So the first one is in the brain .
So I &apos;d like you to meet John .
John is a retired professor of history from Virginia .
So he suffered from essential tremor for many years .
And medication didn &apos;t help him anymore .
And this is his handwriting .
So we put the patient on the MR table .
And the physician will then take a regular MR scan .
And the objective of that ?
This is the sort of general area of the treatment .
It &apos;s a safety boundary around the target .
It &apos;s a target in the thalamus .
The only handwork the physician does here is moving a mouse .
This is the only device he needs in this treatment .
You see the transducer , the light blue .
There &apos;s water in between the skull and the transducer .
And it does this burst of energy .
It elevates the temperature .
We first need to verify that we are on target .
So the first sonication is at lower energy .
This is really a unique capability of the MR.
It is not being used in regular diagnostic imaging .
And you can see the points there on the graph .
The temperature was raised to 43 degrees C temporarily .
This doesn &apos;t cause any damage .
But the point is we are right on target .
This is an immediate relief .
Thank you .
And this is a quote from John after he wrote it .
He said , &quot; Miraculous . &quot;
And you wonder why .
I mean , those people lose their independence .
They are dependent on others .
And John today is fully independent .
He returned to a normal life routine .
Okay , so you can see here the spot .
It &apos;s like three millimeters in the middle of the brain .
There &apos;s no damage outside .
He suffers from no neurodeficit .
There &apos;s no recovery needed , no nothing .
He &apos;s back to his normal life .
Let &apos;s move now to a more painful subject .
Pain is something that can make your life miserable .
And I would like to tell you about PJ .
He had to forgo all the farm activities .
Many patients like that favor radiation therapy .
And his wife actually took him .
They drove like three hours from their farm to the hospital .
So again , this is an immediate relief .
He returned again to his daily routine on the farm .
He rides his tractor .
He rides his horse to their mountain cabin regularly .
And he has been very happy .
Show us some primary cancer .
What can be done there ?
So I have good news and bad news .
And it has been shown actually outside of the U.S.
And doing that in the U.S.
is very painful .
So the first two applications are breast cancer and prostate cancer .
They were the first to be treated by focused ultrasound .
And we have better-than-surgery results in breasts .
But I have a message for the men here .
And this will take time .
This will take two years .
But I have now a message to the ladies .
Women suffer from that disease .
This is Frances .
She was diagnosed with a grapefruit-sized fibroid .
This is a big fibroid .
So she elected to undergo a focused ultrasound procedure in 2008 .
So new life was born .
He can stop the surgery at any moment .
Kirk Citron : And now , the real news
We are drowning in news .
That &apos;s just one source .
That &apos;s the idea behind The Long News .
Or this ?
Or this ?
Really ?
Is this going to matter in 50 or 100 years ?
Okay , that was kind of cool .
Well , let &apos;s take science .
Someday , little robots will go through our bloodstreams fixing things .
That someday is already here if you &apos;re a mouse .
We &apos;re having trouble feeding six billion today .
Britain will starve without genetically modified crops .
What about global politics ?
Makes it a lot easier to put a colony up there .
Tim Jackson : An economic reality check
And hope actually is at the heart of this .
So we &apos;re caught in a kind of trap .
It &apos;s a dilemma , a dilemma of growth .
Now I haven &apos;t got anything against efficiency .
And I think we are a clever species sometimes .
How clever would we have to be ?
It &apos;s around about 770 grams of carbon .
It &apos;s a bit complex , and I apologize for that .
So it looks a little bit like this .
That &apos;s called the circular flow of the economy .
It looks harmless enough .
And what it does essentially is to stimulate further consumption growth .
Joseph Schumpeter called this &quot; the process of creative destruction . &quot;
Status-driven , conspicuous consumption thrives from the language of novelty .
And in the mean time , personal savings absolutely plummeted .
Is this really how people are ?
Is this really how economies behave ? &quot;
The first one is in the crisis itself .
They want to spend less and save more .
&quot; Here they are , the giraffes . &quot;
You can hear the five-year-old mind working .
Goodness knows what they make of the Lake District weather .
What is the objective ?
&quot; What is the objective of the consumer ? &quot;
So who are we ?
Who are these people ?
Are we these novelty-seeking , hedonistic , selfish individuals ?
What we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve created economies .
It isn &apos;t , in fact , about curtailing possibilities .
It is about opening up .
What does all this mean for economics ?
Ecosia is an Internet search engine .
And Ecosia works in pretty much the same way .
And we &apos;re going to do it .
We &apos;re just going to click on Naturejobs.uk.
It &apos;s a different kind of enterprise for a new economy .
Investment has to be a different beast .
It has to be about transition .
It has to be investing in low-carbon technologies and infrastructures .
And of course , this task has material dimensions .
But it &apos;s also clear that prosperity goes beyond this .
And we need that relationship to reflect , to reclaim hope .
What can we offer those people ?
So this is not just a Western post-materialist fantasy .
Ubuntu says , &quot; I am because we are . &quot;
Prosperity is a shared endeavor .
So this is not about standing in the way of development .
It &apos;s not about overthrowing capitalism .
It &apos;s not about trying to change human nature .
Thank you very much .
Can you picture the politicians ever buying into this ?
You &apos;re not making news out of things falling down .
Can I picture politicians doing it ?
Actually , I already am seeing a little bit of it .
But it has to have political leadership .
Kiran Bedi : A police chief with a difference
Now I &apos;m going to give you a story .
Let me begin with my parents .
I &apos;m a product of this visionary mother and father .
They belonged to boys .
We were four girls and no boys .
And my parents were part of a landed property family .
Children don &apos;t choose a school .
They just get the school which parents choose for them .
So this is the foundation time which I got .
I &apos;m the only one who &apos;s left in India .
One , they said , &quot; Life is on an incline .
You either go up , or you come down . &quot;
Out of 100 , 90 are your creation .
They &apos;re good . They &apos;re your creation . Enjoy it .
Ten are nature-sent over which you can &apos;t do a thing .
You can &apos;t do a thing about it .
You &apos;ve got to just respond to the situation .
But that response comes out of those 90 points .
I thought I must tell you this .
Why I said this , is the background .
This is what comes next .
And I redefined policing concepts in India .
I had other options , but I didn &apos;t choose them .
So I &apos;m going to move on .
This is about tough policing , equal policing .
I now went to a prison assignment as a police officer .
Normally police officers don &apos;t want to do prison .
Let &apos;s lock her up . &quot;
Here I got a prison assignment .
Obviously , it was .
And then how did I deal with them ?
I said , &quot; Do you pray ? &quot;
And they didn &apos;t say anything .
I prayed for them , and things started to change .
This is a visual of education inside the prison .
I started this with community support .
Government had no budget .
This was initiated in Delhi prison .
You see one sample of a prisoner teaching a class .
These are hundreds of classes .
I think that &apos;s the bigger change .
It was the beginning of a change .
Teachers were prisoners . Teachers were volunteers .
Books came from donated schoolbooks .
Stationery was donated .
That &apos;s the second landmark .
One , the numbers you &apos;ll never get to see .
Secondly , this concept .
One thousand prisoners who sat in meditation .
And this is what transformed .
You will hear about it , and you will love it .
Let me show you the next slide .
Because crime is a product of a distorted mind .
This worked .
This is a feedback box called a petition box .
This was a magic box .
This was a sensitive box .
Let me wrap it up .
Secondly is about the anti-corruption movement in India .
Friends , you will hear a lot about it .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you very much . Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
Paul Conneally : Digital humanitarianism
The humanitarian model has barely changed since the early 20th century .
Its origins are firmly rooted in the analog age .
And there is a major shift coming on the horizon .
Haiti was a game changer .
Government institutions were completely decapitated , including the presidential palace .
Haiti was something we hadn &apos;t seen before .
But Haiti provided us with something else unprecedented .
Outside Haiti also , things were looking different .
We had basically three requirements .
We wanted to communicate in a two-way form of communication .
We wanted to be able to target specific geographic communities .
And we wanted it to be easy to use .
It has been used to help communities prepare for disasters .
But does it work ?
Some 74 percent of people received the data .
96 percent of them found it useful .
And 73 percent of them shared it .
Technology is transformational .
One illustration of the transformational power of technology is in Kibera .
Kibera is one of Africa &apos;s largest slums .
They have collated crowd-sourced data and rendered the invisible visible .
You can find out about the latest impromptu music session .
You can find out about the latest security incident .
You can find out about places of worship .
You can find out about the health centers .
You can feel the dynamism of this living , breathing community .
And they are giving a voice to themselves .
They are telling their own story , bypassing the official narrative .
SMS is even used to hold herder summits from remote participation .
We need technology as a core organizational principle .
and convert it to humanitarian good .
We now have the tools . We now have the possibilities .
There are no more reasons not to do it .
Thank you very much .
Eric Berlow and Sean Gourley : Mapping ideas worth spreading
And we call that the meme-ome .
So that &apos;s theory , that &apos;s great .
Let &apos;s see how it works in actual practice .
Cameron Russell talking about image and beauty connected over into Europe .
And they &apos;re looking at energy technology and nuclear fusion .
And a few rise to the surface .
There &apos;s a talk about gratitude .
There &apos;s another one about personal health and nutrition .
What &apos;s trending now ? What &apos;s the popular talk now ?
So this is great . It simplifies things .
It &apos;s literally defining a new field .
These are talks that are linking many talks within their discipline .
We used a measure of ecological diversity to get this .
And apparently it smells like bacon .
I wouldn &apos;t know .
SG : So that &apos;s exactly right .
Thank you .
Alison Jackson : An unusual glimpse at celebrity
Momentum was being built .
So people were wondering : was she going to marry Dodi ?
Was she in love with him ?
Was she pregnant ? Did she want his baby ?
Was she pregnant when she died ?
watch her horses . .
And then I was sort of making imagery .
So I &apos;m trying to penetrate that .
Well , here is the image .
Then suddenly , it started to get on front pages .
I was being asked and paid to do front covers .
But then this changed suddenly .
I then started to work for magazines and newspapers .
This was another newspaper image .
They thought it was real .
I explored with actually dressing up as the celebrities myself .
And me as the Queen .
So , all this work is getting shown in art galleries .
Then I made a book .
Stills from the TV series went into this book .
And what is going to happen to the monarchy ?
I &apos;m not really interested in the celebrity themselves .
I &apos;m interested in the perception of the celebrity .
It &apos;s highly commercial .
And Margaret Thatcher visiting Jeffery Archer in jail .
It &apos;s an extremely fast way of getting information .
Thank you .
James Watson : How we discovered DNA
But it slightly bores me .
So early on , I heard of Charles Darwin .
I guess , you know , he was the big hero .
It wasn &apos;t a baseball player ; it was Linus Pauling .
And so I applied to Caltech and they turned me down .
So I had a really quite happy life at Indiana .
You can read it in about two hours .
And -- but then I went to a meeting in Italy .
Most people believed it was proteins .
So there was something universal about the DNA molecule .
And there I met Francis Crick .
So Wilkins said he thought it was the helix .
X-ray diagram , he thought was comparable with the helix .
So we built a three-stranded model .
The people from London came up .
They said it was lousy , and it was .
And basically , I did nothing . And -- except read .
If DNA is that important , Linus will know it .
But there was ones in the literature .
Actually , Linus didn &apos;t look at them that carefully .
I have nothing to do , no qualifications for anything .
And so Bragg said , &quot; Build models . &quot;
Well , of course , I wanted to build models .
She was a crystallographer .
We weren &apos;t the best chemists in the room .
I just put them down like they were in the books .
He said they were wrong .
And we knew we were right .
From nothing to thing .
So we saw how genetic information is carried .
It &apos;s the order of the four bases .
And you copy it by going from strand-separating .
But that &apos;s not the way most scientists think .
Most scientists are really rather dull .
I was decidedly unhappy ; a girl didn &apos;t marry me .
This was taken in Cambridge in September of 1955 .
RNA provides the information for protein .
Well , at that time -- I should go back .
And we use their technique .
So the first disease he looked at is autism .
I mean , big piece at the molecular level .
So this same technique should probably look at all .
It &apos;s a wonderful way to find genes .
And yet , in the controls there were three .
So what &apos;s the meaning of the controls ?
Were they crazy also , and we didn &apos;t know it ?
So it &apos;s , to me , an extraordinarily exciting time .
I thank you .
Conrad Wolfram : Teaching kids real math with computers
We &apos;ve got a real problem with math education right now .
Basically , no one &apos;s very happy .
Those learning it think it &apos;s disconnected , uninteresting and hard .
Those trying to employ them think they don &apos;t know enough .
And teachers are also frustrated .
It &apos;s actually very popular .
You wouldn &apos;t have expected that a few years back .
What &apos;s the point of teaching people math ?
So let &apos;s ask another question .
What is math ?
That &apos;s stage two .
Turn it from that into some answer in a mathematical form .
And of course , math is very powerful at doing that .
And then finally , turn it back to the real world .
Did it answer the question ?
And also verify it -- crucial step .
Now here &apos;s the crazy thing right now .
Math is a much broader subject than calculating .
But in the last few decades that has totally changed .
But that math liberation didn &apos;t get into education yet .
It &apos;s the chore .
That &apos;s an amazing amount of human endeavor .
And I think there are some cases .
For example : mental arithmetic .
I still do a lot of that , mainly for estimating .
People say , &quot; Is such and such true ? &quot;
It &apos;s still quicker to do that and more practical .
It &apos;s a major subject .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s warranted .
So what are the issues people bring up with this ?
Basics of what ?
Are the basics of writing learning how to sharpen a quill ?
I don &apos;t think so .
So there &apos;s another thing that comes up with basics .
My daughter gave me a rather nice anecdote on this .
She enjoys making what she calls &quot; paper laptops . &quot;
Why do you think that was ? &quot;
This one kind of annoys me , I must say .
I don &apos;t think so .
This is just nuts .
All backwards .
Same principles applied -- calculations , harder .
They &apos;ve got hair all over them .
And think of the outside world .
I don &apos;t think so -- quite the opposite .
It &apos;s called programming .
And we open up so many more possibilities .
You can do so many more problems .
We want people who can feel the math instinctively .
That &apos;s what computers allow us to do .
Another thing it allows us to do is reorder the curriculum .
So calculus has traditionally been taught very late .
Why is this ?
This was an example I built for my daughter .
And very , very simple .
And of course , it turns into a circle .
Very simple example .
And you see , this isn &apos;t some dumbed-down model here .
How many years of protection do I need ?
This isn &apos;t some optional extra .
Thanks .
Jay Bradner : Open-source cancer research
The bar is called the Miracle of Science .
The billboards say &quot; Lab Space Available . &quot;
This information is also pretty staggering .
Yet comparatively , we have about a dozen targeted medications .
We didn &apos;t fly him to Boston .
We didn &apos;t sequence his genome .
It &apos;s been known for decades what causes this malignancy .
It &apos;s three proteins -- Ras , Myc and P53 .
There &apos;s no Ras , no Myc , no P53 drug .
And you might fairly ask : why is that ?
It &apos;s a horrible term of trade .
And this is the 21st century .
Now BRD4 is an interesting protein .
It remembers that it &apos;s cancer .
And so we started to work on this problem .
We just started mailing it to our friends .
I have a small lab .
Now this is a very rare cancer , this BRD4-addicted cancer .
They were changing shape .
This got us very excited .
The next step would be to put this molecule into mice .
And every nursing shift we would throw this material out .
And he obliged us .
And every time , we see the same thing .
And so we did just the opposite .
We told people exactly how to make it .
And this was , unfortunately , successful .
You might know that fat has memory .
Nice to be able to demonstrate that for you .
So what next ?
It &apos;s not orally available .
For us , a major and exciting milestone .
I want to leave you with just two ideas .
Yet this information is largely a secret .
Now the business model involves all of you .
This research is funded by the public .
It &apos;s funded by foundations .
Alison Gopnik : What do babies think ?
What is going on in this baby &apos;s mind ?
Let me give you just one example of this .
Now the question is : How could we ask them ?
So how do we actually ask them the question ?
Well it turns out that the secret was broccoli .
I tasted the broccoli . Mmmmm . &quot;
I tasted the crackers . Eww , yuck . &quot;
We did this with 15 and 18 month-old babies .
So there are two really remarkable things about this .
On one side is a New Caledonian crow .
They &apos;re as smart as chimpanzees in some respects .
Whereas the chickens are actually mature within a couple of months .
Well what kind of explanation could we have for this ?
My son is 23 .
All right , why would we see this correlation ?
But real computers are actually getting to be a lot better .
They go out and test it against the evidence .
The evidence makes them change that hypothesis .
This is Reverend Bayes &apos;s notebook .
How could it be that children are doing statistics ?
So the unlikely hypothesis actually has stronger evidence .
Now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
They &apos;re just learning how to count .
Here &apos;s one from Cristine Legare &apos;s lab .
What Cristine did was use our Blicket Detectors .
Boy : How about this ?
Same as the other side .
Boy : This one lighted up , and this one nothing .
AG : Okay , he &apos;s got his experimental notebook out .
Boy : What &apos;s making this light up .
I don &apos;t know .
AG : Every scientist will recognize that expression of despair .
AG : Okay , hypothesis two .
Boy : That &apos;s why .
Oh .
AG : Now this is his next idea .
Not working either .
AG : Okay , that &apos;s a fourth hypothesis .
Boy : It &apos;s lighting up .
So when you put four .
AG : Okay , there &apos;s his fifth hypothesis .
This is actually pretty typical of four year-olds .
And I think just the opposite is true .
Now here &apos;s what we know about how adult consciousness works .
So we have a very focused , purpose-driven kind of attention .
So what &apos;s it like to be a baby ?
Now it &apos;s good to be a grownup .
It &apos;s good to be a grownup .
Eames Demetrios : The design genius of Charles + Ray Eames
And they were a lot of fun .
Is it because Charles and Ray made this film ?
This is the land .
It has many contrasts .
It is rough and it is flat .
In places it is cold .
In some it is hot .
But people live on this land .
Here is something of the way they live .
It was on seven screens and it was 200 feet across .
And it was at the height of the Cold War .
And yet , how did it start ?
So that was just a little snip .
They were always trying things out .
I &apos;m no exception .
But it &apos;s not about them becoming Bono or Tracy Chapman .
And Charles just checking it out there .
This is an unusual installation of airport seating .
And you know some of them would probably be terrible chairs .
And I &apos;m really here to talk about design .
But you know the object is just a pivot .
It &apos;s a pivot between a process and a system .
The design process for Charles and Ray never ended in manufacturing .
It &apos;s not enough to create one .
So I &apos;ve always liked this prototype picture .
You try things out .
This is a relatively famous chair .
Charles and Ray liked this one because it was better .
This is something called a splint .
And they &apos;d been working on furniture before .
This is a house that Charles and Ray designed .
My sister is chasing someone else . It &apos;s not me .
Now look at that plastic chair .
The house is 1949 .
The chair is done in 1949 .
They focused on the need .
They tried to solve the design problem .
It &apos;s kind of a brutal quote .
This is the earlier design of that house .
Here &apos;s a film we &apos;ve been hearing things about .
The &quot; Powers of Ten &quot; is a film they made .
The familiar one on the lower right .
The Eames &apos; film Tops , lower left .
And a lamp that Charles designed for a church .
Which in turn belongs to a local group of galaxies .
Everybody here is coming at it from a different way .
I want to give you one example .
So here is the tiny creature .
Design was not something other .
It was part of the business of life in general .
It was part of the quality of life .
And here is some family pictures .
So we &apos;re going to watch another film .
This is a film , the one called Toys .
Upper left is a film they did on toy trains .
Lower right is a solar do-nothing toy .
Lower left is Day-of-the-Dead toys .
They are often the precursor to bigger things .
And now I &apos;m going to test you .
So can you read it ?
Lucia angel , okay , eye .
Audience : Saw many trains .
Also , what is he doing ? Row , rowed .
Dawn , very good .
Also rode on one . I ...
Citizen Kane , rose -- Audience : Rosebud .
ED : Okay , good .
So you guys did pretty good , cool .
It &apos;s sort of an alternative universe .
It &apos;s kind of a reinterpretation of the landscape .
Those plaques are plaques we &apos;ve been installing around North America .
We &apos;re about to do six in the U.K. next week .
And so we had spelling bees in Paris , Illinois .
Your word is N. Carolina .
Girl : Y-I-N-D-I-A-N-A .
And the town has really embraced it .
We had the spelling bee in conjunction with the Gwomeus Club .
And we could have been born 100,000 years ago .
They have trading cards and all sorts of cool things .
And you &apos;re kind of trapped in the texture of Kymaerica .
The Tahatchabe , the great road building culture .
A guy named Nobu Naga , the so-called Japanese Columbus .
So let &apos;s watch that . Nobody &apos;s ever seen it .
And he made it for the 1939 faculty exhibition .
Silent . We don &apos;t have a track for it yet .
And you try something out .
But here is what &apos;s really great .
Now we &apos;re going to do some movies . &quot;
So we &apos;re going to do the last clip .
So this is Charles &apos; voice .
And then things get to be a little questionable .
There are things like silver-plated thalis .
And there is solid silver thalis .
But you can go beyond that .
And I also want to share this one .
And I really think that &apos;s where we are .
That &apos;s what we all need to do .
I really thank you for your time .
Bill Doyle : Treating cancer with electric fields
And they use low-intensity electric fields to fight cancer .
Let me first address a few popular misconceptions .
And electric fields are not magnetism .
What electric fields are are a field of forces .
Gravity is also a field of forces that act on masses .
We can all picture astronauts in space .
They begin to be attracted towards Earth .
That &apos;s why you &apos;re all in your chairs .
And we can observe this .
This is cultures , identical cultures , of cervical cancer cells .
And we can see them dividing throughout .
The one within the circle manages .
The one up there can &apos;t divide at all .
GBM affects about 10,000 people in the U.S. each year .
It &apos;s a death sentence .
The expected five year survival is less than five percent .
We divided the patients into two groups .
And then the second group received only Tumor Treating Field therapy .
They had no pain , suffered none of the infections .
Robert Dill-Bundi is a famous Swiss cycling champion .
And five years ago , Robert was diagnosed with GBM .
He received the standard treatments .
He received surgery .
He received high dose radiation to the head .
And he received first-line chemotherapy .
He entered our trial .
And here we can see him getting the therapy .
First of all , these electrodes are noninvasive .
There &apos;s none of the tiredness .
There &apos;s no sensation .
It doesn &apos;t interfere with computers or electrical equipment .
This is a therapy that takes time to work .
It &apos;s still there .
I am the happiest , the happiest person in the world .
And every single morning I appreciate life .
Lydia &apos;s a 66 year-old farmer in Switzerland .
She was diagnosed with lung cancer five years ago .
Her cancer continued to grow .
Three years ago , she entered the Novocure lung cancer trial .
She is managing her farm .
She &apos;s interacting with her kids and her grand kids .
Now she can run all of the activities of her farm .
It &apos;s only the beginning .
Thank you .
Yves Rossy : Fly with the Jetman
Yves uses his body to steer the wing .
He &apos;s acting as a human fuselage , so to say .
And that &apos;s quite unique .
When he arches his back , he gains altitude .
There is Yves Rossy .
So our first critical moment , it &apos;s open .
He is down . Is he flying ?
Commentator Two : It looks like he &apos;s stabilized .
He &apos;s starting to make his climb .
He &apos;s out over the channel .
There is Yves Rossy .
There is no turning back now .
He is over the English Channel and underway .
Ladies and gentlemen , an historic flight has begun .
Commentator : There he is .
Yves Rossy has landed in England .
And now he &apos;s in Edinburgh . Yves Rossy .
And his equipment as well .
Yves , welcome . It is quite amazing .
And there were many , many others .
So it &apos;s possible to fly almost like a bird .
What is it &#91; like &#93; to be up there ?
Yves Rossy : It &apos;s fun . It &apos;s fun .
I don &apos;t have feathers .
But I feel like a bird sometimes .
How did you start to become Jetman ?
When you go out of an airplane you are almost naked .
You take a position like that .
And that &apos;s the nearest thing to the dream .
You have no machine around you .
You are just in the element .
It &apos;s very short and only in one direction .
YR : It &apos;s about 300 km per hour before looping .
That means about 190 miles per hour .
And what &apos;s the weight of the equipment you &apos;re carrying ?
I have 55 kilos on my back .
And you &apos;re not piloting ?
There is no handle , no steering nothing ?
And I wanted to keep this freedom of movement .
And it &apos;s really like the kid playing the airplane .
I want to go down like that .
And up I climb , I turn .
It &apos;s really pure flying .
It &apos;s not steering , it &apos;s flight .
YR : Actually , I try to stay just fit .
I don &apos;t do special physical training .
Just , I try to keep my mobility through new activities .
So you have to adapt .
But for example , bikers , they have the same speed .
Describe for me the equipment since you have it here .
So Breitling &apos;s four engines .
YR : Yeah , two-meter span .
Ultrastable profile .
Harness , parachute .
My only instruments are &#91; an &#93; altimeter and time .
I know I have about eight minutes fuel .
So just check before it &apos;s finished .
And yeah , that &apos;s all .
Two parachutes .
And this is my life .
That &apos;s the real important thing about safety .
I thought , okay , I will go out .
But most probably I did something like that .
Something that is not very safe in image .
So the next thing I saw was just blue .
It was the sea .
I have also an audible altimeter .
And then I did open my chute .
I see . Maybe come back here .
This is risky stuff indeed .
People have died trying to do this kind of thing .
I assume you have standards .
YR : Yeah . I have no checklist for that .
Let &apos;s not tell you employer .
YR : No , that &apos;s really two worlds .
Civil aviation is something that we know very well .
We have a hundred years of experience .
And you can adapt really precisely .
With that , I have to adapt to something new .
That means improvise .
So it &apos;s really a play between these two approaches .
So plan B , always a plan B.
In a fighter , you have an ejection seat .
That &apos;s my ejection seat .
It &apos;s well said . It &apos;s well said .
What happens if one of the engines stops ?
YR : I do a roll .
Did you land on the rim , down at the bottom ?
YR : It was down on the bottom .
But it was too stoney and full of cactus on top .
That &apos;s exactly why I asked the question .
YR : And also the currents are quite funny there .
There is big thermal activity , big difference in altitude also .
YR : I have a standard answer .
Have you ever seen tandem birds ?
Perfect answer .
Yves , one last question .
What &apos;s next for you ? What &apos;s next for Jetman ?
YR : First , to instruct a younger guy .
I want to share it , to do formation flights .
So instead of jumping off a plane , yes ?
Really , I go step by step .
It seems a little bit crazy , but it &apos;s not .
And I hope it will be for everybody .
Yves , thank you very much . Yves Rossy .
James B. Glattfelder : Who controls the world ?
But this is different .
This is coming from the heart of finance .
It gets worse .
What &apos;s happening here ? How can this be possible ?
Unfortunately , the answer is yes .
I ended up in physics by accident .
In a nutshell , you can think of physics as follows .
You encode it into equations .
Then predictions can be made and tested .
Despite the success , physics has its limits .
This paradox is what got me interested in complex systems .
These are just a few examples .
So what do we know about complex systems ?
As a result , networks are ideal representations of complex systems .
Where are economic networks ?
This is a surprising and prominent gap in the literature .
Similar data has been around for quite some time .
What we looked at in detail was ownership networks .
So ownership networks reveal the patterns of shareholding relations .
How are they organized ? Are they isolated ?
Are they interconnected ?
And what is the overall distribution of control ?
In other words , who controls the world ?
I think this is an interesting question .
And it has implications for systemic risk .
This is a measure of how vulnerable a system is overall .
This is the TNC network which we analyzed .
And it turns out to be structured as follows .
And we already see signs of organization going on here .
Well , ownership gives voting rights to shareholders .
This is the normal notion of control .
And the network really matters .
You get the idea .
It &apos;s actually not that hard to understand .
Let me explain by giving you this analogy .
So what did we find after computing all this network control ?
They &apos;re mostly financial institutions in the U.S. and the U.K.
And it gets even more extreme .
What should you take home from all of this ?
This means that its structure is probably the result of self-organization .
Our study &quot; is an impression of the moon &apos;s surface .
It &apos;s not a street map . &quot;
And this is slowly starting .
Now there is still a big problem , in my opinion .
But this is just my own personal ideology .
Thank you .
Zainab Salbi : Women , wartime and the dream of peace
It was deep at night .
I do not remember what time it was .
And I kept on staring at it until it disappeared .
This is my story .
I was that girl .
I am another image and vision of another survivor of war .
I am that refugee , and I am that girl .
We only talk about one side of it .
It is actually about silence , the silence of humanity . &quot;
That &apos;s what my mother in Iraq used to tell me .
It &apos;s like dying from inside-out .
We have been only seeing one side of war .
This is the language of sterility .
How casually we treat casualties in the context of this topic .
This is where we conceive of rape and casualties as inevitabilities .
Ninety percent of modern war casualties are civilians .
Seventy-five percent of them are women and children .
How interesting .
How interesting .
These just become numbers that we refer to .
It is a chess game .
Checkmate .
We are missing a completely other side of wars .
That was her fight .
That was her resistance .
And the ones who are keeping that life are women .
There are two sides of war .
We must have a full picture of what that means .
We need to understand peace from a toenail &apos;s perspective .
Not one , but 50 percent .
She got into Women for Women International &apos;s program .
She got a support network .
She learned about her rights .
She was earning 450 dollars . She was doing okay .
She was sending them to school . Have a new home .
I will meet you there .
Let us make this field a much bigger place .
Let us all meet in that field .
Thank you .
Jessica Green : Are we filtering the wrong microbes ?
What determines the types and distributions of microbes indoors ?
And they are brought inside by humans and other creatures .
And we looked at three different types of rooms .
And we also sampled the outdoor air .
But being less diverse is not necessarily good for our health .
And this is because we &apos;re all constantly shedding microbes .
Why does this matter ?
Thank you .
Bill Gates : Teachers need real feedback
Everyone needs a coach .
Sorry , Sharon . Here you go .
We all need people who will give us feedback .
That &apos;s how we improve .
I &apos;m talking about teachers .
How would I know who was the best ?
How would I know what I was doing differently ?
Our teachers deserve better .
The system we have today isn &apos;t fair to them .
Let &apos;s start by asking who &apos;s doing well .
Consider the rankings for reading proficiency .
The U.S. isn &apos;t number one .
We &apos;re not even in the top 10 .
We &apos;re tied for 15th with Iceland and Poland .
Eleven out of 14 .
Some teachers are far more effective than others .
What would that system look like ?
For example , did they ask their students challenging questions ?
Did they find multiple ways to explain an idea ?
&quot; Do you learn to correct your mistakes ? &quot;
And what we found is very exciting .
So it tells us we &apos;re asking the right questions .
Sarah Brown Wessling : Good morning everybody .
Let &apos;s talk about what &apos;s going on today .
My name is Sarah Brown Wessling .
Turn to somebody next to you .
It doesn &apos;t catch every little thing that &apos;s going on .
And I &apos;m able to learn a lot from it .
Alrighty , everybody , have a great weekend .
I &apos;ll see you later .
But we still have more work to do .
Building this system will also require a considerable investment .
The impact for teachers would be phenomenal .
This wouldn &apos;t just make us a more successful country .
I hope you are too .
Thank you .
Pico Iyer : Where is home ?
Where do you come from ?
And if &quot; Where do you come from ? &quot;
means &quot; Where were you born and raised and educated ? &quot;
And if &quot; Where do you come from ? &quot;
means &quot; Where do you pay your taxes ?
Where do you see your doctor and your dentist ? &quot;
I do actually feel more alien the longer I live there .
And if &quot; Where do you come from ? &quot;
Home for them is really a work in progress .
I literally couldn &apos;t point to any physical construction .
Already , we represent the fifth-largest nation on Earth .
You can &apos;t take anything for granted .
Suddenly you &apos;re alert to the secret patterns of the world .
So they become friends . They fall in love .
They move to New York City .
Or Edinburgh .
It &apos;s the place where you become yourself .
This was the wrong answer .
Several lifetimes , actually .
He found himself .
All around me were 800 acres of wild dry brush .
I didn &apos;t consult the monks for guidance .
That &apos;s not the point .
It &apos;s the place where you stand .
Thank you .
Mena Trott : Meet the founder of the blog revolution
But then I started thinking about my family .
So , who am I ?
Chris kind of mentioned I started a company with my husband .
We have about 125 people internationally .
Bloggers exposed this , or they worked hard to expose this .
And then you have something like this , which is Interplast .
I am not that caring .
You can laugh , this is OK .
This is me .
This is what happened to me .
And then I wrote a post about a banjo .
And those people who know me understood my joke .
How much money does he spend on beer in a year ?
You could take that money and buy your banjo .
Why don &apos;t you open a separate account ? &quot;
And then I got people saying , &quot; Leave him . &quot;
And why are they reading this ? &quot;
I don &apos;t want to write for this public audience .
And I started to kill my blog slowly .
But anyways .
His father was a blogger .
And he never expected this .
And this is a one-pound baby .
So Odin was documented every single day .
Pictures were taken every day : day one , day two ...
But then it gets better . Day 96 he goes home .
And you see this post .
So , blogs .
So what ? You &apos;ve probably heard these things before .
It &apos;s this record of who you are , your persona .
Millions and hundreds of millions and billions of people .
And so , that &apos;s an amazing thing to consider .
And just these little things .
So , that has always influenced me .
I wish that I would have this of my family .
That was an amazing thing .
And that &apos;s a huge thing .
So , thank you .
James Geary : Metaphorically speaking
Metaphor lives a secret life all around us .
We utter about six metaphors a minute .
Lips are not lips , but volcanoes .
She is not she , but a buttercup .
And love is not love , but being all shook up .
This is the mathematics of metaphor .
And fortunately it &apos;s very simple .
X equals Y.
This formula works wherever metaphor is present .
So , how do we make and understand metaphors ?
This might look familiar .
The first step is pattern recognition .
Look at this image . What do you see ?
Three wayward Pac-Men , and three pointy brackets are actually present .
What we see , however , are two overlapping triangles .
Second step , conceptual synesthesia .
We all have synesthetic abilities .
This is the Bouba / Kiki test .
Can we do a quick show of hands ?
Does that correspond ?
Okay , I think 99.9 would about cover it .
Why do we do that ?
And many of the metaphors we use everyday are synesthetic .
Silence is sweet .
Neckties are loud .
Sexually attractive people are hot .
Sexually unattractive people leave us cold .
Third step is cognitive dissonance .
This is the Stroop test .
You can take the test now .
Stroop tests have been done with metaphor as well .
Sadly , it &apos;s metaphorically true .
Metaphor matters because it creates expectations .
Pay careful attention the next time you read the financial news .
That &apos;s a hypothetical example of course .
But this is how metaphor misleads .
Metaphor also matters because it influences decisions by activating analogies .
And they had to make a decision .
What should they do ?
Intervene , appeal to the U.N. , or do nothing ?
Metaphor matters because it opens the door to discovery .
Einstein described his scientific method as combinatory play .
Now metaphor is ubiquitous , yet it &apos;s hidden .
Ralph Waldo Emerson described language as &quot; fossil poetry . &quot;
But before it was fossil poetry language was fossil metaphor .
And these fossils still breathe .
But there is a better translation .
Thank you very much .
Chris Abani : On humanity
In South Africa , they have a phrase called Ubuntu .
It &apos;s really very simple , but really very complicated .
So , I thought I should start with some stories .
And she was dark , too .
My mother was English .
She was five foot two , very feisty and very English .
It &apos;s totally rad . &quot;
I said , &quot; English , mum . &quot;
But her Igbo wasn &apos;t too good .
So she took me along to translate .
I was seven .
And , &quot; Do you notice any discharges ? &quot;
And , &quot; How swollen is your vulva ? &quot;
My mother said , &quot; Someone has to . &quot;
It was my mother with five little children .
And she told this woman .
Dirges so melancholic that they would scorch you .
But today , women are rebuilding Rwanda .
Their humanity never seems to matter very much to us .
And I was supposed to do this alone .
So , this guy comes with me .
I was a wimp .
I cried for a very long time .
And afterwards , he didn &apos;t say a word .
He just sat there watching me cry for an hour .
So , I was born two days after Christmas .
Take anything you want out of the suitcase .
It &apos;s your birthday present . &quot;
So , here was this 14-year-old kid on death row .
And not everybody on death row was a political prisoner .
There were some really bad people there .
He was obsessed .
It &apos;s incredible .
I was really worried .
He didn &apos;t know what death row meant .
Then I &apos;d say , &quot; How do you know ? &quot;
They killed him .
All around us , everywhere , there are people like this .
The Igbo used to say that they built their own gods .
This is how they came to reclaim their humanity .
It doesn &apos;t require a tremendous thing .
&quot; Libation , North Carolina , 1999 .
I offer to this ground , this gin .
I call a name that could be his .
This is for you , old man .
This gin , this salty earth . &quot;
Thank you .
Alexis Ohanian : How to make a splash in social media
That &apos;s what you &apos;d call a social news website .
But this isn &apos;t even about Reddit itself .
It &apos;s actually about humpback whales .
These humpback whales were getting killed .
I believe this is a Farsi word for &quot; immortal . &quot;
And then there was this : Mister Splashy Pants .
And , you know , Redditors responded and all agreed .
Well , that got us a little angry .
So , we changed it to Fightin &apos; Splashy .
Facebook groups were getting created . Facebook applications were getting created .
And this was the final vote . When all was cleared ...
the next highest name pulled in three . Okay ?
So , there was a clear lesson here .
And that was that the Internet loves Mister Splashy Pants .
Which is obvious . It &apos;s a great name .
And I think that &apos;s what helped drive this .
They sell Mister Splashy Pants shirts and pins .
And this is kind of how the Internet works .
Thank you .
Temple Grandin : The world needs all kinds of minds
You wouldn &apos;t have any ...
It &apos;s a continuum of traits .
You have to get away from verbal language .
I think in pictures , I don &apos;t think in language .
And the thing is , the normal brain ignores the details .
People are getting away from doing hands-on stuff .
Rapid movement , contrast .
My drawings got to star in the movie too .
My mind works like Google for images .
I thought everybody thought in pictures .
I see only specific pictures .
OK , how about famous ones ?
Just really quickly , like Google for pictures .
I &apos;m not going to go into any gucky slaughter slides .
That was like just so super cool .
This is tensor imaging .
Now , another kind of mind is the pattern thinker .
More abstract . These are your engineers , your computer programmers .
And there in the background is the pattern for folding it .
Some of these oftentimes have problems with reading .
You &apos;ll see these different kinds of minds .
Now , another thing is the sensory issues .
You know , it &apos;s going to be variable .
He knows who &apos;s been there , when they were there .
There &apos;s a ton of information on that fire hydrant .
Cattle are the same way .
You see , it &apos;s a different picture .
Or do I have something wrong with the equipment ? &quot;
In other words , categorize equipment problem from a people problem .
I find a lot of people have difficulty doing that .
Or is the whole design of the system wrong ?
People have a hard time figuring that out .
Yeah , I &apos;m a million-mile flier .
It would be their airplane tails .
It &apos;s tails , pure and simple .
It &apos;s specific . See , my thinking &apos;s bottom-up .
He &apos;d been abused by somebody with a black cowboy hat .
White cowboy hats , that was absolutely fine .
And this brings up the whole thing of my science teacher .
My science teacher is shown absolutely beautifully in the movie .
He was now Dr. Carlock in the movie .
And they &apos;re not going down the right path .
It &apos;s kind of a trade-off between thinking and social .
This is the work of Dr. Bruce Miller .
We &apos;ve got to show these kids interesting stuff .
I mean art was my best subject in school .
And let &apos;s talk about jobs .
But you know what ? I was getting work experience .
I was taught that when I was eight years old .
I was taught that when I was very , very young .
They &apos;ve got to learn how to do something else .
Let &apos;s say the kid is fixated on Legos .
Let &apos;s get him working on building different things .
It just drives me crazy .
What can visual thinkers do when they grow up ?
And we need to be working with these students .
And this brings up mentors .
You know , my science teacher was not an accredited teacher .
He was a NASA space scientist .
We need to be doing that .
You &apos;re getting that kid turned on .
Mentors are just essential .
I cannot emphasize enough what my science teacher did for me .
And we &apos;ve got to mentor them , hire them .
And it can only use so much memory . &quot;
That &apos;s the kind of specificity you need .
Well , that &apos;s the end of my talk .
And I just want to thank everybody for coming .
It was great to be here .
Oh , you &apos;ve got a question for me ? OK .
Thank you so much for that .
I got social interaction through shared interest .
That was like , we considered that super cool .
What are you most passionate about ?
How many cattle got poked with the prodder ?
How many cattle are mooing their heads off ?
And it &apos;s very , very simple .
You directly observe a few simple things .
It &apos;s libraries .
And this is before the Internet got really big .
TG : Well thank you so much . Thank you .
Wael Ghonim : Inside the Egyptian revolution
This is Revolution 2.0 .
No one was a hero . No one was a hero .
Because everyone was a hero .
Everyone has done something .
We all use Wikipedia .
Everything was going bad .
Everything was going wrong .
Those were the achievements of our great regime .
Yet , nothing was happening .
In fact , people were extremely frustrated .
Everyone was scared .
But in fact , the majority were scared .
Everyone did not want really to get in trouble .
A dictator cannot live without the force .
They want to make people live in fear .
It &apos;s helping all of us to connect .
There are a lot of people who are frustrated . &quot;
There are lots of people who are frustrated .
There are lots of people who actually share the same dream .
There are lots of people who care about their freedom .
They probably have the best life in the world .
They are happy . They don &apos;t have problems .
But they are still feeling the pain of the Egyptian .
It was an educational campaign .
Khaled Saeed was killed in June 2010 .
I still remember the photo .
I still remember every single detail of that photo .
The photo was horrible .
He was tortured , brutally tortured to death .
But then what was the answer of the regime ?
He &apos;s someone who escaped from all these bad things . &quot;
But people did not relate to this .
People did not believe this .
He was a middle-class guy .
His photo was remembered by all of us .
A page was created .
Get those who killed this guy .
To just bring them to justice . &quot;
But of course , they don &apos;t listen .
Everyone was an owner in this page .
People started contributing ideas .
And next time it &apos;s going to be vibration . &quot;
People were making fun of the idea .
And they were doing this thing .
But did the regime learn anything ? Not really .
They were actually attacking them .
And things had developed until the Tunisian revolution .
This whole page was , again , managed by the people .
There was no leader .
The leader was everyone on that page .
Yes we can . We can do it .
The revolution is happening .
I was detained on the 27th night .
Thank God I announced the locations and everything .
But they detained me .
I was detained for 12 days , blindfolded , handcuffed .
I was not allowed to speak with anyone .
And I went out .
The next day I was in Tahrir .
The fear is no longer fear .
It &apos;s actually strength -- it &apos;s power .
People were so empowered .
Completely opposite .
Extremism became tolerance .
I said that , &quot; We are going to win .
We are going to win because we don &apos;t understand politics .
We &apos;re going to win because we have dreams .
And that &apos;s actually what happened . We won .
For me that &apos;s winning , regardless of all the details .
Thanks a lot .
Dean Ornish : Healing through diet
To me , that &apos;s the real natural wonder .
And it &apos;s not a diet .
We used quantitative arteriography , showing the narrowing .
Huge differences can occur without drugs , without surgery .
You just never know .
It &apos;s important , but not enough .
Well , because it helps them get through the day .
The most effective anti-smoking ad was this one .
Your sexual function improves .
You feel kind of sleepy afterwards .
Mississippi , more than 25 percent of people are overweight .
but it doesn &apos;t last , which is the problem .
The other way is to change the type of food .
But insulin accelerates the conversion of calories into fat .
So , and you get all the disease-protective substances .
And these are predominantly what are called the Omega-3 fatty acids .
You find these , for example , in fish oil .
He says , &quot; I &apos;ve got some good news .
They just met once a week for a year .
It was a randomized control study published in The Lancet .
Other studies have shown this as well .
Thank you .
R.A. Mashelkar : Breakthrough designs for ultra-low-cost products
The big residual is always value for money .
All the time we are trying to get value for money .
But if you don &apos;t have money , what happens ?
Well , poor do not remain poor ; they become lower-middle-class .
They believe that things can be done .
But great leaders like Ratan have compassion .
Let me confirm what she said .
Yes , I went barefoot until I was 12 .
I struggled to &#91; unclear &#93; day was a huge issue .
That &apos;s how I &apos;m standing before you .
So that is the House of Tata .
Innovation , compassion and passion .
They combine all that .
And you can see the cartoon here .
And incredible car .
We &apos;ll manufacture a car in the Nano Segment . &quot;
How did this great story unfold , the making of Nano ?
Let me tell you a bit about it .
And he told them , &quot; Question the unquestionable .
Stretch the envelope . &quot;
Can you believe it ?
Until midnight , he &apos;d be thinking .
Early morning he &apos;ll be coming back with sort of solutions .
But who was the team leader ?
And the Nano team average age was just 27 years .
And they did innovation in design and beyond .
Broke many norms of the standard conventions for the first time .
Adhesives were replacing the rivets .
All ideas on board were welcome .
I mean , it was incredible innovation .
Seeking solutions for non-auto sectors .
The fuel lines and lamps were as in two-wheelers .
All the time , you have been given an envelope .
And therefore , each component had to have a dual functionality .
The length is smaller by eight percent by the way .
Volkswagon was 11,333 .
And British Motor was around 11,000 .
And Nano was , bang , 2,000 dollars .
And those dreams are getting fulfilled .
The driver &apos;s name is Naran .
He has bought his own Nano .
And that &apos;s why I call it a transformational innovation .
What is its price ? 20,000 dollars .
Unfortunately , that &apos;s not the case in India .
And they climb up for their work .
You have to design an artificial foot for such conditions .
A challenge , of course .
You just don &apos;t have it .
And therefore , you ought to look at alternatives .
And that is how Jaipur Foot was created in India .
... above the limb , yes , it would be difficult ...
&quot; Did it hurt ? &quot;
&quot; No ... not at all . &quot;
So that &apos;s what it is all about .
And therefore Time took notice of this 28-dollar foot , basically .
An incredible story .
Let &apos;s move on to something else .
I &apos;ve been talking about getting more from less for more .
Let &apos;s move to health .
What &apos;s happening in the area of health ?
You know , you have new diseases that require new drugs .
Today it costs 1.5 billion dollars .
No , I &apos;m sorry .
Let us just take an example .
Psoriasis is very dreadful disease of the skin .
The cost of treatment , 20,000 dollars .
Can we do it &#91; for &#93; 100 dollars ?
Time for development , not 10 years .
We are in a hurry . Five years .
Cost of development -- 300 million dollars .
Sorry . I can &apos;t spend more than 10 million dollars .
Looks absolutely audacious .
Looks absolutely ridiculous .
You know something ? This has been achieved in India .
These targets have been achieved in India .
And how they have been achieved ...
And that is how this difference has come .
You can see before treatment and after treatment .
Let me just remind you of what Mahatma Gandhi had said .
It &apos;s not about low cost .
It &apos;s about ultra-low cost .
You &apos;re not talking exclusive innovation .
You &apos;re talking about inclusive innovation .
You know , incubators for infants , for example .
They &apos;re not available in Africa .
They &apos;re not available in Indian villages .
And infants die .
And incubator costs 2,000 dollars .
And by whom ?
Their heart is in the right place , like Ratan Tata .
That &apos;s the new world that we want to create .
And that is why the message is that of Gandhian engineering .
Ladies and gentlemen , I &apos;d like to end before time .
I was also afraid of those 18 minutes .
I &apos;ve still one and a half to go .
What was that ?
And that can come only from Gandhian engineering .
Lakshmi Pratury : Thank you , Dr. Mashelkar .
LP : A quick question for you .
What do you think that drove you ?
It was &#91; unclear &#93; high school .
But it was a poor school with rich teachers , honestly .
And there was a bright spot up there .
But then he held it for a little while , Lakshmi .
And then the paper burned .
But more importantly , focus and you can achieve .
What does that focal length do ?
It has parallel lines , which are sun rays .
And the property of parallel lines is that they never meet .
What does that convex lens do ?
It makes them meet .
This is convex lens leadership .
You know what today &apos;s leadership is doing ? Concave length .
They divide them farther .
So I learned the lesson of convex lens leadership from that .
And when I was at National Chemical Laboratory &#91; unclear &#93; .
That was the lesson . That was the inspirational moment .
LP : Thank you very much .
Steven Pinker : What our language habits reveal
The problem is , which verbs go in which constructions ?
The verb is the chassis of the sentence .
It &apos;s the framework onto which the other parts are bolted .
For example , the dative construction in English .
Hundreds of verbs can go both ways .
This would be an example of how to do that .
Unfortunately , there appear to be idiosyncratic exceptions .
How are these construals reflected in language ?
Only humans can possess things .
So why should anyone care ?
&quot; The messenger went from Paris to Istanbul . &quot;
This kind of indirect speech is rampant in language .
I think most people understand the intent behind that .
No one &apos;s fooled .
So what &apos;s going on ?
Now , relationship types can be negotiated .
Well , what does this have to do with language ?
The simplest example of this is in the polite request .
On the other hand , you want the damn guacamole .
if language -- where it could only be used literally .
Nothing ventured , nothing gained .
In that case , the consequences are rather severe .
So this is a rather fraught situation .
So you get the best of both worlds .
Thank you very much .
Charles Leadbeater : The era of open innovation
That &apos;s 58 billion dollars .
That &apos;s the idea of creativity .
More special people , more special places .
Expand the pipeline down to the consumers .
Well this view , I think , is increasingly wrong .
Why is that ?
The payoffs to innovation are greatest where the uncertainty is highest .
So , you &apos;re in a big corporation .
You &apos;re obviously keen to go up the corporate ladder .
Big corporations have an in-built tendency to reinforce past success .
.
So what happens ? Rap music is created by the users .
They work at their leisure , if you like .
This has huge organizational implications for very large areas of life .
Take astronomy as an example , which Yochai has already mentioned .
And it was huge -- it was absolutely enormous .
The users can be producers .
What does this mean , then , for our organizational landscape ?
This is open ; this is closed .
This is new ; this is traditional .
Let me just give you two examples .
There &apos;ll be huge professional arguments as well .
They &apos;re not reading my brilliant article ! &quot;
Those were the two places .
They want to be part of that flow of information .
So , there &apos;s going to be a tremendous struggle .
The first is : can we really survive on volunteers ?
What should be the role of public policy ?
And I was having dinner with this guy called Timothy Chan .
Timothy Chan set up an Internet business in 2000 .
Nine thousand servers all over China , has 250 million subscribers .
How many people does he employ to service that population ?
500 people .
Because basically , he doesn &apos;t service them .
You &apos;ve got two options .
That costs about 100 dollars .
Thank you very much .
Richard Sears : Planning for the end of oil
And one of the reasons is this is remarkable stuff .
It &apos;s great stuff .
A bigger one for you to look at .
Geologists have a pretty good idea of where the oil is .
But there &apos;s actually more to the story than that .
Now , it &apos;s about 35 percent .
So oil is playing a less significant role every year .
And what goes on in the future ?
What is the future of truly sustainable , carbon-free energy ?
Here &apos;s a piece of limestone .
I picked it up outside of Marble Falls , Texas .
It &apos;s about 400 million years old .
And it &apos;s just limestone , nothing really special about it .
Now , here &apos;s a piece of chalk .
What &apos;s different is how the molecules are put together .
Now , millions of abalone every year make this shell .
But it &apos;s not the same stuff ; it &apos;s different .
This is pretty incredible stuff .
All the same , what &apos;s different ?
How the molecules are put together .
Now , what does this have to do with energy ?
Here &apos;s a piece of coal .
And so that is my story .
The oil will never run out .
It &apos;s not because we have a lot of it .
Thank you very much .
Kamal Meattle : How to grow fresh air
The botanical names are in front of you .
And we need six to eight waist-high plants per person .
And this particular plant removes formaldehydes and other volatile chemicals .
And it has close to 1,200 such plants for 300 occupants .
Why is this important ?
And thank you for listening .
Maz Jobrani : Did you hear the one about the Iranian-American ?
Then there was Aron Kader , who was the Palestinian-American .
And then there was me , the Iranian-American of the group .
Those two countries aren &apos;t getting along these days .
These are dilemmas I have every day .
So I remember getting my American passport .
&quot; I &apos;m trying to go places . &quot;
&quot; Ah ha ! American , great . &quot;
And he started asking me questions .
He said , &quot; What is your father &apos;s name ? &quot;
He goes , &quot; What is your grandfather &apos;s name ? &quot;
I said , &quot; He passed away a long time ago .
His name was Jabbar . &quot;
You owe us two billion dollars . &quot;
Like I think you &apos;re missing the point here .
&quot; Why would I do that ?
Right .
&quot; Well , then blow yourself up .
Just do it outside , please . &quot;
But the fact is , there &apos;s good people everywhere .
All it takes in one person to mess it up .
&quot; We just wanted to say we tried . &quot;
&quot; And furthermore , it is the thought that counts . &quot;
&quot; And in conclusion , win some , lose some . &quot;
Don &apos;t be Hassan . Don &apos;t be Hussein . &quot;
That &apos;s not one of us . &quot;
&quot; Damn it ! Why Jack ? Why ? &quot;
I just did a seven-country solo tour .
I was in Oman , and I was in Saudi Arabia .
I was in Dubai .
And it &apos;s great , there &apos;s good people everywhere .
And you learn great things about these places .
I encourage people always to go visit these places .
For example , Dubai -- cool place .
They have a mall there , the Dubai Mall .
It is so big , they have taxis in the mall .
I was walking . I heard &quot; Beep , beep . &quot;
I &apos;m like , &quot; What are you doing here ? &quot;
It &apos;s like a drug deal .
&quot; You want some frozen yogurt ?
Come here . Come here . Come here .
Not in the Middle East .
And I &apos;ve been guilty of stereotyping as well .
And they don &apos;t get paid that well .
He goes , &quot; I thought you were my driver . &quot;
&quot; My name is Bond , Jamal Bond . &quot;
Have a good day . Thank you .
Stefana Broadbent : How the Internet enables intimacy
And what do I mean by that ?
And somebody brought a boyfriend , somebody a father .
One young woman brought her grandfather .
Now , lets take some data . Facebook .
A lot of sociologists actually are quite disappointed .
There are three stories that I think are quite good examples .
The first gentleman , he &apos;s a baker .
And I &apos;ve heard this story a number of times .
Then there is another couple , there is a Brazilian couple .
They &apos;ve lived in Italy for a number of years .
They Skype with their families a few times a week .
And now , obviously , they have it open .
Whenever they have a moment they chat to each other .
So , none of these cases are unique .
I mean , I could tell you hundreds of them .
But what is really exceptional is the setting .
Maybe you had a direct line .
And it had nothing to do with technical capability .
That was where the focus had to be .
And then the school enacts perfectly well .
They were living on top of the land they were laboring .
And they are doing it massively .
I really think that the number is conservative .
100 percent are using text .
But there are many institutions that are actually blocking this access .
Companies blocking access to IM or to Facebook .
Terry Moore : How to tie your shoes
And I think that &apos;s true .
Now I know that seems ludicrous .
I know that seems ludicrous .
But not so -- let me demonstrate .
Now as it turns out -- thank you .
Wait , there &apos;s more .
And here &apos;s how to tell .
That &apos;s the weak form of the knot .
But not to worry .
We &apos;re going to do this one more time .
Start as usual , go the other way around the loop .
Pull the knot .
There it is : the strong form of the shoe knot .
Live long and prosper .
Roger Ebert : Remaking my voice
It was like breathing .
I used to be able to talk like that .
I will start with my wife , Chaz .
The first surgery was a great success .
I saw myself in the mirror and I looked pretty good .
Two weeks later , I was ready to return home .
Suddenly , I had an episode of catastrophic bleeding .
My carotid artery had ruptured .
So thank you , Leonard Cohen , for saving my life .
&quot; It was the clearest I could find .
How does that affect who you are as a person ?
How did I feel not being able to speak ?
I &apos;ve become uncomfortable when I &apos;m separated from my laptop .
At first I was against it .
But I decided then to just give it a try .
They &apos;d never made one from previously-recorded materials .
But they were willing to give it a try .
And it sounded like me , it really did .
There was a reason for that ; it was me .
But it wasn &apos;t that simple .
I &apos;ll let you hear a sample of that voice .
And here &apos;s the voice we call Roger Jr .
or Roger 2.0 .
This is the first version of my computer voice .
When I read something , it will read in my voice .
The voice was created by a company in Scotland named CereProc .
This is the first voice they &apos;ve created for an individual .
The flow isn &apos;t natural .
A very large sample is needed .
John Hunter : All my life I was a motormouth .
In cosmological terms , that was about 10 minutes ago .
That has mostly happened in my lifetime .
It was about 1960 .
The initials stood for Programmed Logic for Automated Teaching Operations .
The programmers said it could assist students in their learning .
But that &apos;s not the point .
But I &apos;m not here from the Chamber of Commerce .
I &apos;m here as a man who wants to communicate .
All of this has happened in my lifetime .
Does anybody remember that ? &quot;
It is unimaginable what will happen next .
For billions of years , the universe evolved completely without notice .
We are born into a box of time and space .
I cannot speak ; I can only type so fast .
They give me a way to speak .
Not everybody has the patience of my wife , Chaz .
But online , everybody speaks at the same speed .
This whole adventure has been a learning experience .
Now I have no jaw left at all .
But no you don &apos;t .
People -- People talk loudly -- I &apos;m so sorry .
Excuse me .
People talk loudly and slowly to me .
Sometimes they assume I am deaf .
There are people who don &apos;t want to make eye contact .
You should never let your wife read something like this .
It is human nature to look away from illness .
We don &apos;t enjoy a reminder of our own fragile mortality .
My ability to think and write have not been affected .
And on the Web , my real voice finds expression .
One of my Twitter friends can type only with his toes .
Google him and he will make you laugh .
So I have not come here to complain .
I have much to make me happy and relieved .
I seem , for the time being , to be cancer-free .
I am writing as well as ever .
I am productive .
I would be trapped inside my head .
RE : Wait . I have one more thing to add .
A guy goes into a psychiatrist .
The psychiatrist says , &quot; You &apos;re crazy . &quot;
The guy says , &quot; I want a second opinion . &quot;
James Burchfield : Playing invisible turntables
Let &apos;s just get started here .
Okay , just a moment .
All right .
Oh , sorry .
Thank you .
Steven Cowley : Fusion is energy &apos;s future
I &apos;ve always been very worried about resource .
And as a child you &apos;re always worried about resource .
Big events in my life , a strange child .
Energy , at the moment , is dominated by resource .
And those resources are going away .
Fission .
China is building nuclear power stations . Everybody is .
Fusion is very hard to do .
We &apos;ve been trying for 50 years .
Okay . What is fusion ? Here comes the nuclear physics .
I was a strange child .
Nuclear energy comes for a simple reason .
It &apos;s a medium-sized nucleus .
And you can get energy out this way .
And indeed that &apos;s exactly what stars do .
And you push them together and they repel .
So , most of the time they repel .
And that energy is what powers fusion .
And it &apos;s this reaction that we want to do .
There is one trickiness about this reaction .
You have to make it from something else .
And that &apos;s the way you make your tritium .
Now , why the hell would we bother to do this ?
This is basically why we would bother to do it .
And the yellow line is the most optimistic estimate .
And then we get to uranium .
To go any further you would have to have breeder technology .
Is it cost-competitive ?
And we get within about the same price as current electricity .
So , how would we make it ?
We have to hold something at 150 million degrees .
And , in fact , we &apos;ve done this .
We hold it with a magnetic field .
It boils away in the middle at 150 million degrees .
And in fact we can make fusion happen .
And just down the road , this is JET .
This is the device we &apos;re building now .
It gets very expensive to do this research .
Seven nations are involved in building this .
But that &apos;s not electricity yet .
We have to get to this .
We have to get to a power plant .
I wish this were different . We really need it now .
So 2030 looks like an infinity away .
Camille Seaman : Photos from a storm chaser
Everything is interconnected .
As a Shinnecock Indian , I was raised to know this .
There were no clouds in the sky .
And after a while I began to perspire .
That &apos;s part of you up there .
Storm chasing is a very tactile experience .
I &apos;ve learned to respect the lightning .
My hair used to be straight .
I &apos;m just kidding .
They become lovely monsters .
All my relations . Thank you .
Tony Robbins : Why we do what we do
What is your motive for action ?
All of us here have great minds .
And with our minds we can rationalize anything .
But we all know that that &apos;s bullshit at times .
But I really want to know what &apos;s driving you .
What makes the difference in their performance ? &quot;
Because that &apos;s what I got hired to do .
I &apos;ve got to produce the result now .
How do you make a change ?
Because science is easy , right ?
But when it comes to fulfillment -- that &apos;s an art .
Audience : Aye .
Thanks for the interaction on a high level there .
Supreme Court .
And you correct me if I &apos;m wrong .
The defining factor is never resources ; it &apos;s resourcefulness .
Audience : Aye .
Audience : Yes .
The story people tell us is a bunch of different stories .
But I appreciated the energy , I &apos;ll tell you that .
Honestly , better or worse ? Say , &quot; Aye . &quot;
Audience : Aye .
How would their lives be different ? Their impact ?
The history of our world is these decisions .
But what was his decision of what to focus on ?
Different than most people . What did it mean ?
We all have had time .
Say , &quot; Aye . &quot;
Audience : Aye .
Your model of the world is what shapes you long term .
That &apos;s what makes people make decisions .
And it &apos;s made up of three parts , I believe .
First , what &apos;s your target ? What are you after ?
Which , I believe -- it &apos;s not your desires .
How many have been there ? Say , &quot; Aye . &quot;
Audience : Aye .
We need variety . We need surprise .
Audience : Aye .
Bullshit . You like the surprises you want .
You can do it by being more spiritual .
And you &apos;re going to get hurt again .
Aren &apos;t you glad you came to this positive visit ?
Because the sixth need is to contribute beyond ourselves .
You can feel the difference in him and it &apos;s beautiful .
It &apos;s been fantastic .
Thank you .
The last thing is emotion .
How may know somebody like this ? Come on .
And she played the recording for us in the room .
10 seconds .
Thank you . I hope this was of service .
Vik Muniz : Art with wire , sugar , chocolate and string
I was asked to come here and speak about creation .
Creativity is how we cope with creation .
See , for instance , in this picture .
I just did things .
You didn &apos;t trust information very much .
Somebody was hitting somebody else with brass knuckles .
The first works were actually objects .
And I called them relics .
They were displayed first at Stux Gallery in 1983 .
This is the clown skull .
They lived in Brazil , long time ago .
This is the Ashanti joystick .
The rocking podium .
This is the pre-Columbian coffeemaker .
The Bonsai table .
So I decided to do work with clouds .
Because clouds can mean anything you want .
&quot; The Snail . &quot;
&quot; The Teapot . &quot;
And he did something that was very tricky .
He put together two different media from different periods of time .
And it &apos;s totally overkill .
And your eye doesn &apos;t know which level to read .
And you become trapped into this kind of representation .
&quot; Relaxation . &quot;
&quot; Fiat Lux . &quot;
And I wanted to deal with other subjects .
So this is a lighthouse .
I got some photographs from them .
&quot; Valicia . &quot;
&quot; Jacynthe . &quot;
But another layer of representation was still introduced .
So they &apos;re called &quot; Pictures of Chocolate . &quot;
And Jackson Pollock also .
&quot; Paparazzi . &quot;
And I picked minimalist pieces because they &apos;re about specificity .
This is Richard Serra .
This is a pipe .
A hanger .
So they &apos;re like perfect actors .
Well , I think that &apos;s it .
My time is nearly up .
Thank you very much .
Greg Stone : Saving the ocean one island at a time
Brian Skerry took this shot . Thanks , Brian .
And I &apos;ve dived in deep-sea submersibles around the world .
I needed to put it into a context .
I needed to head towards conservation goals .
I led three diving expeditions to Antarctica .
And therefore we &apos;re way behind on protection .
So where are the Phoenix Islands ?
They &apos;ve never been dived . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Yeah .
But I was in for the adventure .
It &apos;s a very deep-water part of our planet .
The average depths are about 12,000 ft .
Seamounts are important for biodiversity .
It &apos;s an interesting fact .
And the Phoenix Islands is very rich in those seamounts .
Both my personal and my professional life changed .
Phoenix Islands is a major tuna location .
And we finished our trip .
And that &apos;s the area again .
And what &apos;s the context of the Phoenix Islands ?
Where do these exist ?
In the west we have the Gilbert Islands .
And then over to the east we have the Line Islands .
It &apos;s the largest atoll nation in the world .
And they have about 110,000 people spread out over 33 islands .
Because that &apos;s where all the ocean is . &quot;
They &apos;re also a country that is in dire danger .
The Islands rise only one to two meters above the surface .
Some of the islands have already gone under water .
And these nations are faced with a real problem .
We as a world are faced with a problem .
So it &apos;s something we need to focus on .
Just get whatever anybody wants . &quot;
They &apos;d never had any information from the Phoenix Islands .
And are you free for dinner ? &quot;
He coined the term &quot; reverse fishing license . &quot;
And Conservation International had struck some of those deals .
Many , many steps were taken to pull this off .
And that &apos;s the story with climate-change heating .
And it certainly was .
So the conditions for success here are listed .
You can read them yourselves .
How do we realize Sylvia &apos;s dream ?
Where eventually do we take this ?
Thank you very much .
Jake Barton : The museum of you
This is Charley Williams .
He was 94 when this photograph was taken .
The idea is very , very simple .
You can see it in Pedro .
Where &apos;s the right finger ?
DB : Yes . Of course . I love you .
My grandfather was a cab driver for 40 years .
He used to pick people up here every day .
So it seems right .
This is a shot from the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel .
Voice 10 : Trying to frantically get to a radio .
My business partner told me to turn on the television .
Voice 15 : So I switched on the television .
This is the so-called slurry wall .
&quot; How could 9 / 11 have happened ? &quot;
You can see the relationships between the different names themselves .
Thank you very much .
Stacey Kramer : The best gift I ever survived
Imagine , if you will -- a gift .
I &apos;d like for you to picture it in your mind .
So envision what it looks like all wrapped up .
It will bring all of your family together .
Adoration and admiration will overwhelm you .
It will recalibrate what &apos;s most important in your life .
It will redefine your sense of spirituality and faith .
You &apos;ll have a new understanding and trust in your body .
You &apos;ll have unsurpassed vitality and energy .
You &apos;ll eat countless gourmet meals .
Flowers will arrive by the truckload .
And you &apos;ll have a lifetime supply of good drugs .
You &apos;ll be challenged , inspired , motivated and humbled .
Your life will have new meaning .
Peace , health , serenity , happiness , nirvana .
The price ?
$ 55,000 , and that &apos;s an incredible deal .
Does Amazon carry it ?
Does it have the Apple logo on it ?
Is there a waiting list ?
Not likely .
This gift came to me about five months ago .
And this , and then this .
I &apos;m not sure you &apos;d want it .
But I wouldn &apos;t change my experience .
Rory Stewart : Time to end the war in Afghanistan
The question today is not : Why did we invade Afghanistan ?
Why are we spending $ 135 billion ?
Why have we got 130,000 troops on the ground ?
How has this happened ?
So the question is : What are we doing ?
Why are we still stuck in Afghanistan ?
All of this is wrong .
Every one of those statements is wrong .
Afghanistan does not pose an existential threat to global security .
They simply don &apos;t have a conventional military option .
Because this isn &apos;t the 1990s anymore .
Today , there are 14 health clinics in that area alone .
There was amazing improvements .
And we had progress in the free media .
And the same is true for the troops .
This is Commandant Haji Malem Mohsin Khan of Kamenj .
Commandant Haji Malem Mohsin Khan of Kamenj was a great host .
Today , he could never do that .
Now is this a new idea ?
And yet , nobody listened to them .
Instead , there was a litany of astonishing optimism .
Well guess what ? It didn &apos;t .
How do we allow any of this to happen ?
You feel deep , deep guilt .
What is the solution to this ?
We need to somehow get their message to the policymakers .
And this is very difficult to do because of our structures .
Diplomats are locked in embassy compounds .
And there was not a single Pashto speaker .
So we need to change that institutional culture .
And thirdly , we need to have some humility .
It isn &apos;t .
Bosnia and Kosovo were signal successes , great successes .
A million properties have been returned .
The national army has shrunk .
But you need to look at context .
And this is what we &apos;ve lost in Afghanistan and Iraq .
We criticized them for being quite slow to return refugees .
We &apos;re not matching our resources to our priorities .
Why mountain rescue ?
This is the wrong way of looking at it .
It &apos;s about context .
It makes failure invisible , inconceivable and inevitable .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you .
Rory , you mentioned Libya at the end .
And we are always being tempted up to our neck .
We could have done that .
Rory , thank you very much .
RS : Thank you .
Geoff Mulgan : A short intro to the Studio School
What I want to talk about today is one idea .
You work by learning , and you learn by working .
And the design we came up with had the following characteristics .
We started with two schools .
That &apos;s grown this year to about 10 .
Interestingly , it &apos;s happened almost entirely without media coverage .
It &apos;s happened almost entirely without big money behind it .
And this one is focused on creative and media industries .
We think we &apos;re onto something .
It doesn &apos;t animate them .
Thank you very much .
Jack Horner : Where are the baby dinosaurs ?
None , huh ?
All right .
I &apos;m going to talk about dinosaurs .
Do you remember dinosaurs when you were that age ?
Dinosaurs are kind of funny , you know .
I hope you all realize that .
That &apos;s it .
What &apos;s the fascination ?
They &apos;re all gone .
Now I assume that we remember dinosaurs .
And there &apos;s lots of different shapes .
Lots of different kinds .
They went out and gathered them up .
And this is an interesting story .
And that happened for all museums .
And this was in the early 1900s .
Look at these dinosaurs .
They &apos;re all big .
Where are all the little ones ? &quot;
You &apos;d have a big dinosaur and a littler dinosaur .
But all they had were big dinosaurs .
And it comes down to a couple of things .
They like to name anything .
Everybody likes to have their own animal that they named .
In 1975 , a light went on in somebody &apos;s head .
And in fact , he used the cassowary as an example .
Now think about that .
So allometric cranial ontogeny is relative skull growth .
So this was interesting .
So this is where people went astray again .
But scientists have egos ; they like to name things .
And so they went on naming dinosaurs because they were different .
And that &apos;s by actually cutting into their bones .
They put them in foam , little containers .
They &apos;re very well taken care of .
So they don &apos;t normally let you do that .
So that &apos;s what I do .
You can tell it &apos;s mature bone .
So it &apos;s real easy to tell them apart .
So what I want to do is show you these .
And so we will evaluate them .
And that &apos;s sort of what I &apos;ve been doing .
they say , &quot; Go away . &quot;
So here are 12 dinosaurs .
And we want to look at these three first .
So these are dinosaurs that are called Pachycephalosaurs .
And everybody knows that these three animals are related .
You can only determine relatedness by looking for similarities .
Guess where that came from ? Dragon .
Nobody noticed the gnarly stuff sort of looked alike .
And the other one is more primitive than the other .
And one would think , that should give me a clue .
But it didn &apos;t give them a clue .
Because , well we know why .
Scientists like to name things .
So it is going to get bigger .
The dome , that little dome , is growing really fast .
It &apos;s inflating very fast .
Which of course means that Stygimoloch and Dracorex are extinct .
Okay .
And we know why , right ?
Because everybody wants to have a big one .
So everyone had a big one .
They &apos;re everywhere . They &apos;re all over the place .
So we have a whole bunch of them at our museum .
And everybody says it &apos;s because I have a little museum .
When you have a little museum , you have little dinosaurs .
And then as they grow older , the horns grow forward .
And that &apos;s pretty cool .
And the little one is really spongy .
And the middle size one is really spongy .
But what was interesting was the adult Triceratops was also spongy .
And this is a skull that is two meters long .
It &apos;s a big skull .
But it &apos;s got these big holes in its shield .
&quot; And it has holes in its frill . &quot;
So now we know that Torosaurus is actually a grownup Triceratops .
So Torosaurus is extinct .
I mean , here &apos;s Edmontosaurus and Anatotitan .
Anatotitan : giant duck .
It &apos;s a giant duck-bill dinosaur .
Here &apos;s another one .
So we look at the bone histology .
And we get rid of Anatotitan .
So we can just keep doing this .
And the last one is T. Rex .
So there &apos;s these two dinosaurs , T. Rex and Nanotyrannus .
Again , makes you wonder .
But they had a good question .
So it must be true -- they must be different . &quot;
So we cut into them .
It looks like it could still get bigger .
And of course , Nano has 17 .
And that &apos;s a good number .
That &apos;s a good number to go extinct , I think .
Fourth-graders love their dinosaurs , they memorize them .
And they &apos;re not happy with this .
Thank you very much .

Jared Diamond : Why do societies collapse ?
What about ourselves ?
The fourth item on my checklist is relations with hostile societies .
What about a society today ?
But scratch the surface , and Montana suffers from serious problems .
Going through the same checklist : human environmental impacts ?
Are there any general conclusions that arise ?
How could the Easter Islanders have deforested their environment ?
I &apos;ll just mention two generalizations in this area .
What &apos;s going to be the outcome today ?
Morley : &quot; Women of Hope &quot;
Malcolm Gladwell : The unheard story of David and Goliath
Still same is true of Israel today .
And 3,000 years ago , that &apos;s exactly what happens .
They &apos;re originally from Crete . They &apos;re a seafaring people .
This was a tradition in ancient warfare called single combat .
He &apos;s 6 foot 9 .
You &apos;re this kid . This is this mighty warrior . &quot;
So he says , &quot; All right . &quot;
He says , &quot; I can &apos;t wear this stuff . &quot;
That &apos;s all he &apos;s carrying .
Now why do we call David an underdog ?
In ancient warfare , there are three kinds of warriors .
There &apos;s cavalry , men on horseback and with chariots .
It &apos;s in fact an incredibly devastating weapon .
This is an incredibly devastating weapon .
They were incredibly accurate .
Saul has the same expectation .
But David has absolutely no expectation .
That &apos;s where his strength lies .
There &apos;s a second piece of this that &apos;s important .
It &apos;s also that we profoundly misunderstand Goliath .
Goliath is not what he seems to be .
Now that is weird , right ?
Here is this mighty warrior challenging the Israelites to one-on-one combat .
He &apos;s not even carrying a sword .
Why does Goliath not react to that ?
Sticks ? David only has one stick .
There have been many articles written .
He had acromegaly .
Do you remember the wrestler André the Giant ?
Famous . He had acromegaly .
There &apos;s even speculation that Abraham Lincoln had acromegaly .
Because he can &apos;t make his way on his own .
Because he can &apos;t see him .
Come to me because I can &apos;t see you .
He sees two sticks when David has only one .
Giants are not as strong and powerful as they seem .
And sometimes the shepherd boy has a sling in his pocket .
Thank you .
Bernie Krause : The voice of the natural world
But they do .
The soundscape is made up of three basic sources .
The second of these is the biophony .
They were just there , but they had no significance .
This is Lincoln Meadow .
This is an example of a spectrogram .
There were a lot of them .
And here &apos;s Lincoln Meadow before selective logging .
This is after selective logging .
Coming up is the sound of a woodpecker .
However , our ears tell us a very different story .
But I can tell you that they do express themselves .
Whether or not we understand it is a different story .
And they do that for two reasons .
I want to end with a story told by a beaver .
Yeah . Well .
Thank you for listening .
Aparna Rao : High-tech art
So my uncle is only dealing with a mechanical interface .
And at the slightest sound , they hide back again .
So we had these panels on three walls of a room .
So this is how it works .
This is a video prototype .
And they hear like humans do , or real creatures do .
So they get immune to sounds that scare them after awhile .
And they don &apos;t react to background sounds .
So this is a very early prototype .
Of course , it got much better after that .
This is a video installation called &quot; The Missing Person . &quot;
How would it be possible to experience a sense of invisibility ?
Soren enters the room . Pop ! He goes invisible .
So this is a work called &quot; The Sun Shadow . &quot;
So this work is a caricature of an upside-down man .
And it &apos;s kind of constrained by that circle .
And there &apos;s no wires .
That &apos;s my colleague . He &apos;s let it go .
And it &apos;s at the scale of the night sky .
Thank you .
Charles Robertson : Africa &apos;s next boom
Africa is booming .
It &apos;s that quick .
And malaria nets actually are playing a role in that .
This shouldn &apos;t surprise us , because actually , everybody grows .
And the West is engaging with that .
Politics gets weaker when debt is high .
The private sector as well .
That &apos;s an awful lot of debt .
Does anyone recognize this ? In fact , they do .
And this investment is actually Western-led .
Ten percent &apos;s come from India .
And they &apos;re investing in energy .
Africa produces 10 million barrels a day of oil now .
It &apos;s the same as Saudi Arabia or Russia .
And they &apos;re investing in telecoms , shopping malls .
And it &apos;s not just about African demographics .
Now , that &apos;s completely changed now .
So where do you set up your new factory ?
You look at South Asia , and people are .
A bit dangerous , sometimes .
Would you set up a factory in sub-Sahara in the mid-1970s ?
Nobody else did .
So what &apos;s Africa looking like today ?
This is how I look at Africa .
It &apos;s a bit odd , because I &apos;m an economist .
South Africa is playing a role .
And I &apos;m showing you something else with these maps .
I &apos;m showing you democracy versus autocracy .
Fragile democracies is the beige color .
Strong democracies are the orange color .
Why does that matter ?
He won by a margin .
So democracy is encouraging governments to invest in education .
It &apos;s a positive , virtuous circle .
How can you invest in Africa when there &apos;s corruption ? &quot;
When you &apos;re poor , corruption is not your biggest priority .
Three out of 10 . That &apos;s not good .
Every poor country is corrupt .
Every rich country is relatively uncorrupt .
You see the middle class grow .
Economists aren &apos;t great at forecasting .
Because the question really is , what happens next ?
People got poorer in Africa in the 1990s .
No offense .
India is one of those examples .
This is Indian growth from 1960 to 2010 .
Ignore the scale on the bottom for a second .
And then something happened in 1980 .
Boom ! India began to explode .
Life expectancy is going to go up by 13 years .
&quot; Charlie , why are you so pessimistic ? &quot;
And you know what ?
Actually , I think they &apos;ve got a point .
And I think here we can play a role .
Because technology does let you help .
No , not right now , just 30 seconds .
You can go and buy some of the great tunes .
My iPod &apos;s full of them .
Buy African products .
Invest .
Thank you very much .
Jimmy Wales : The birth of Wikipedia
And everything about Wikipedia is managed by virtually an all-volunteer staff .
So we &apos;ve got over 600,000 articles in English .
So this is where we get to Yochai &apos;s discussion .
It &apos;s a very unusual and chaotic thing .
We &apos;ve got over 90 servers now in three locations .
These are managed by volunteer system administrators who are online .
You could never afford to do this in a company .
And everything is managed by the volunteers .
And that &apos;s essentially our main cost .
The media has covered this somewhat extensively .
It started out with an article in Red Herring .
So how do we do this ?
How do we manage the quality control ?
How does it work ?
So real-time peer review .
And then users can set up their own personal watch list .
And we have over 40 IRC channels , 40 mailing lists .
All of that stuff is just on Wiki pages .
There &apos;s no reason to have a big argument about it .
And it also matters who the people are who are voting .
Like I say , it &apos;s a tight knit community .
So how &apos;s all this governed ?
There &apos;s a certain amount of aristocracy .
It just isn &apos;t appropriate .
Well , they managed to get 18 people to show up .
That &apos;s neo-Nazi math for you .
Thank you .
Ben Saunders : Yeah , hi , Ben Saunders .
It builds on the storyline of bloggers versus newspapers .
But I think there &apos;s going to be huge impacts .
But freely licensed textbooks are the next big thing in education .
Andrew McAfee : What will future jobs look like ?
This is the best economic news on the planet these days .
Not that there &apos;s a lot of competition , right ?
And there &apos;s actually a huge amount of truth here .
We are seeing an amazing flourishing taking place .
This is just a plain statement of the facts .
We are in the middle of an astonishing period .
Right ? Great , hang up , flourish , go home .
So this is clearly bad news for Reuther .
But the middle class is clearly under huge threat right now .
We &apos;re going to call him &quot; Ted . &quot;
He &apos;s at the top of the American middle class .
We &apos;re going to call that guy &quot; Bill . &quot;
Over time , Ted &apos;s marriage has stayed quite happy .
Bill &apos;s hasn &apos;t .
Other ways that Bill is dropping out of society ?
So the economic playbook is actually pretty straightforward .
The societal one is a lot more challenging .
I do know that education is a huge part of it .
I witnessed this firsthand .
We have to do better than this .
We cannot keep turning out Bills .
So we see some green shoots that things are getting better .
So the green shoots are out there .
We &apos;re facing very tough challenges .
We could send Congress on an autonomous car road trip .
Abraham Lincoln realized there was one other ingredient .
The great point is to give them the plain facts . &quot;
Thank you very much .
David Brooks : The social animal
But what they do have is incredible social skills .
But they have those social skills .
And he &apos;s going into a diner .
And then he describes the home he owned in their village .
And the fact is , people learn from people they love .
But that reality is expunged from our policy-making process .
It would be a big seller .
You see them on the mountains up there .
And this leads to oddities .
Now I &apos;m a middle-aged guy .
I &apos;m not exactly comfortable with emotions .
One of my favorite brain stories described these middle-aged guys .
And the brain scans were identical in both activities .
It was just sheer terror .
It tells us what to imprint .
The brain is the record of the feelings of a life .
We &apos;re social animals , not rational animals .
We are now children of the French Enlightenment .
We believe that reason is the highest of the faculties .
Babies come with this ability .
He wagged his tongue at the baby .
The baby wagged her tongue back .
Twenty percent of kids do not have those relationships .
They are what we call avoidantly attached .
They have trouble relating to other people .
So for example , we are overconfidence machines .
Ninety-five percent of our professors report that they are above-average teachers .
Ninety-six percent of college students say they have above-average social skills .
This is a gender-linked trait , by the way .
They have epistemological modesty .
They are open-minded in the face of ambiguity .
They are curious .
And these traits are often unrelated and uncorrelated with IQ .
Then you could talk about a trait like blending .
It seems so elementary .
But this is the source of innovation .
The conscious mind hungers for success and prestige .
That is what the unconscious mind hungers for .
The Greeks say we suffer our way to wisdom .
Through his suffering , Hofstadter understood how deeply interpenetrated we are .
Thank you .
Barry Schwartz : Our loss of wisdom
But what did he appeal to ?
Invest , invest , invest . &quot;
And he appealed to virtue .
Virtue is an old-fashioned word .
Let me begin with an example .
And all of the items on it are unremarkable .
Not one .
Now , not all janitors are like this , of course .
To serve other people , not to manipulate other people .
Wisdom depends on experience , and not just any experience .
And you need to be mentored by wise teachers .
At TED , brilliance is rampant .
It &apos;s scary .
Now , I hope that we all know this .
It &apos;s a story about lemonade .
So he brought it back .
And they were ready to let the kid go .
But not so fast .
The Wayne County Child Welfare Protection Agency said no .
At that point , can the child go home ?
How do things like this happen ?
Fair enough .
One tool we reach for is rules .
Better ones , more of them .
The second tool we reach for is incentives .
Better ones , more of them .
What else , after all , is there ?
Regulate , regulate , regulate .
Fix the incentives , fix the incentives , fix the incentives ...
And would you pay them a bonus for being empathic ?
It &apos;s preposterous on its face .
The lemonade story is one .
Here &apos;s an example from Chicago kindergarten .
We know why these scripts are there .
Scripts like these are insurance policies against disaster .
And they prevent disaster .
But what they assure in its place is mediocrity .
Don &apos;t get me wrong . We need rules !
We need more rules for the bankers , God knows .
But too many rules prevent accomplished jazz musicians from improvising .
Now , how about incentives ?
They seem cleverer .
Right ?
Well , not always .
I &apos;ll just give you one example because time is racing .
There was going to be a national referendum .
Astonishingly , 50 percent of the citizens said yes .
They knew it was dangerous .
They thought it would reduce their property values .
The psychologists asked other people a slightly different question .
Instead of 50 percent saying yes , 25 percent said yes .
all we ask is , &quot; What serves my interests ? &quot;
Get smarter incentives .
Any incentive system can be subverted by bad will .
We need incentives . People have to make a living .
We see this in medicine .
And we certainly see it in the world of business .
So what can we do ?
One way not to do it : teach more ethics courses .
What to do instead ?
One : Celebrate moral exemplars .
No 10-year-old goes to law school to do mergers and acquisitions .
People are inspired by moral heroes .
Well , acknowledge them .
Be proud that you have them .
Celebrate them .
That &apos;s one thing we can do .
Just at this TED we heard talks from several moral heroes .
Two were particularly inspiring to me .
Why ? Because it was the right thing to do .
His employees are inspired by the effort .
Yesterday we heard Willie Smits talk about re-foresting in Indonesia .
In many ways this is the perfect example .
Because it took the will to do the right thing .
God knows it took a huge amount of technical skill .
And you don &apos;t have to be a mega-hero .
There are ordinary heroes .
Ordinary heroes like the janitors who are worth celebrating too .
And any moral work depends upon practical wisdom .
One is that we are always teaching .
Someone is always watching .
The camera is always on .
They need to learn to respect themselves .
They need to learn to respect their schoolmates .
They need to learn to respect their teachers .
That &apos;s the principle objective .
Obama appealed to virtue .
And I think he was right .
He also appealed to hope .
Right again .
I think there is reason for hope .
I think people want to be allowed to be virtuous .
In many ways , it &apos;s what TED is all about .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
You have to go and stand out here a sec .
Barry Schwartz : Thank you very much .
Hans Rosling : Insights on HIV , in stunning data visuals
AIDS was discovered 1981 ; the virus , 1983 .
There were quite many people infected in the United States .
And , up there , you see Uganda .
And they were probably the most infected country in the world .
Now , what has happened ?
But first , I have a new invention here .
I have solidified the beam of the laser pointer .
So , ready , steady , go !
First , we have the fast rise in Uganda and Zimbabwe .
They went upwards like this .
And almost the same happens here .
25 years it took .
Now , let me make a fast replay of Botswana .
So there &apos;s some problem with these metrics now .
But focus now is back on prevention .
I would say , HIV is very different in Africa .
We have to stop that .
So , why is it so high ? Is it war ?
No , it &apos;s not . Look here .
And this is peaceful Zambia , neighboring country -- 15 percent .
So , is it poverty ?
So , this is the difference within Tanzania .
And , I can &apos;t avoid showing Kenya .
Look here at Kenya .
I &apos;ve split Kenya in its provinces .
Here it goes .
So , what is it then ?
Why do we see this extremely high levels in some countries ?
But where are they situated ?
I will swap the bubbles to a map .
HIV exists all over the world .
Look , you have bubbles all over the world here .
Brazil has many HIV-infected .
Arab countries not so much , but Iran is quite high .
They have heroin addiction and also prostitution in Iran .
India has many because they are many .
Southeast Asia , and so on .
It could be concurrency .
It could be some virus types .
But what we think is that it could be concurrency .
And what is concurrency ?
In Sweden , we have no concurrency .
We have serial monogamy .
Vodka , Midsummer &apos;s Eve -- new partner for the fall .
Vodka -- and it goes on like this , you know ?
And you collect a big number of exes .
Probably , it &apos;s a combination of this .
You can get this chart , free .
We have uploaded UNAIDS data on the Gapminder site .
Thank you very much .
Bob Mankoff : Anatomy of a New Yorker cartoon
Nobody is ever satisfied 100 percent with humor except this woman .
Bob Mankoff : That &apos;s my first wife .
That part of the relationship went fine .
Now let &apos;s look at this cartoon .
But like I said , you cannot satisfy everyone .
You couldn &apos;t satisfy this guy .
Here I &apos;m one person talking to you .
Let &apos;s look at this cartoon .
&quot; Discouraging data on the antidepressant . &quot;
Indeed , it is discouraging .
Right ? You thought it was funny .
Generally , about 85 percent of the people liked it .
But look at the individual responses .
This person rated it a two .
Other people thought it was funny .
Humor is a type of entertainment .
That &apos;s a bad zoo .
But this is a worse one .
Where is the danger going to exist ?
How are you going to manage it ?
My job is to look at 1,000 cartoons a week .
Of course , many , many cartoons must be rejected .
Cartoonists come in through the magazine every week .
But they mostly are going to be rejected .
That &apos;s the nature of any creative activity .
Many of them fade away . Some of them stay .
Matt Diffee is one of them .
Here &apos;s one of his cartoons .
Drew Dernavich . &quot; Accounting night at the improv . &quot;
And of course , that is not New Yorker humor .
What is New Yorker humor ?
This is What Lemmings Believe .
No . It &apos;s about us .
And this is my most well-known cartoon .
It &apos;s been reprinted thousands of times , totally ripped off .
In each instance , our expectations are defied .
In each instance , the narrative gets switched .
There &apos;s an incongruity and a contrast .
He is both being polite and rude .
Basically , that &apos;s the way humor works .
So I &apos;m a humor analyst , you would say .
Nobody is much interested , and the frog dies .
This guy . Who is he ? He &apos;s the critic .
Bob Mankoff : &quot; Oooh , no .
Ehhh .
Oooh . Hmm . Too funny .
Normally I would but I &apos;m in a pissy mood .
I &apos;ll enjoy it on my own . Perhaps .
No . Nah . No .
Overdrawn . Underdrawn .
Drawn just right , still not funny enough .
No . No .
For God &apos;s sake no , a thousand times no .
Office worker : Smoked turkey with bacon ? BM : No .
Eh , no .
Office worker : Grilled cheese ? BM : No .
Office worker : BLT ? BM : No .
Office worker : Green bean salad ? BM : No .
No . No .
That &apos;s sort of an exaggeration of what I do .
So I &apos;ll give you some examples of rejection collection humor .
&quot; I &apos;m thinking about having a child . &quot;
&quot; Ass-head . Please help . &quot;
I &apos;m going to explain why .
Within that context , we feel it &apos;s okay .
Within the context of The New Yorker magazine ...
So there the violation is malign . It doesn &apos;t work .
There is no such thing as funny in and of itself .
Everything will be within the context and our expectations .
One way to look at it is this .
When we &apos;re in a playful mood , we want excitement .
We want high arousal . We feel excited then .
&quot; The Rejection Collection &quot; is absolutely in this field .
You want to be stimulated . You want to be aroused .
You want to be transgressed .
It &apos;s like this , like an amusement park .
Voice : Here we go .
This is another cartoon from &quot; The Rejection Collection . &quot;
&quot; Too snug ? &quot;
That &apos;s a cartoon about terrorism .
The New Yorker occupies a very different space .
How would The New Yorker attack it ?
Better left undrawn .
The first week we did no cartoons .
That was a black hole for humor , and correctly so .
It &apos;s not always appropriate every time .
But the next week , this was the first cartoon .
We were going to exist . Here &apos;s another one .
These cartoons are not about them . They &apos;re about us .
The humor reflects back on us .
It &apos;s called dispositional humor .
Here &apos;s another cartoon .
Humor does need a target .
The target is the readership and the people who do it .
The humor is self-reflective and makes us think about our assumptions .
That is a deeply profound cartoon .
Different frames of reference .
&quot; You slept with her , didn &apos;t you ? &quot;
&quot; Lassie ! Get help ! ! &quot;
It &apos;s called French Army Knife .
Now there are some cartoons that are puzzling .
Like , this cartoon would puzzle many people .
How many people know what this cartoon means ?
The dog is signaling he wants to go for a walk .
This is the signal for a catcher to walk the dog .
It &apos;s sort of a smorgasbord that &apos;s made all interesting .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Robert Full : Learning from the gecko &apos;s tail
Let me share with you today an original discovery .
These are gecko toes .
And the individual has 2 billion of these nano-size split ends .
They don &apos;t stick by Velcro or suction or glue .
And here is its first test .
More recently , this happened .
This the first time someone has actually climbed with it .
How do you know ?
Lynn Verinsky : Because of liability insurance .
Robert Full : That &apos;s what she did on rough surfaces .
Here is the actual robot .
And here is what it does .
There it is .
So what they did was they asked us an important question .
Even though we put a passive bar there .
We said , &quot; Well , what do tails do ? &quot;
Well we know that tails store fat , for example .
We know that you can grab onto things with them .
It can also act as a counterbalance .
So watch this kangaroo .
See that tail ? That &apos;s incredible !
Marc Raibert built a Uniroo hopping robot .
And it was unstable without its tail .
But of course , this is a passive tail .
And you can also have active tails .
Myhrvold thinks tail-cracking dinosaurs were interested in love , not war .
It can also be used in defense .
Pretty powerful .
So we then went back and looked at the animal .
And we ran it up a surface .
So here is normal speed .
This is incredible .
The engineers had a really good idea .
They &apos;re climbing up a wall , or a tree .
And we did that experiment , that you see here .
And this is what we discovered .
Now that &apos;s real time . You can &apos;t see anything .
But there it is slowed down .
What we discovered was the world &apos;s fastest air-righting response .
But geckos do it better .
And they do it with their tail .
If we could have the lights on it .
Okay , there it goes .
And show the video .
There it is .
And it works just like it does in the animal .
So we did . And here is what it does .
It does an equilibrium glide . Highly controlled .
So we can maneuver this way .
It oscillates its tail up and down like a dolphin .
It can actually swim through the air .
What does that mean for the origin of flapping flight ?
Stay tuned for that .
And it certainly looks like it .
You can see it even better from down on top .
Watch the animal .
Definitely moving towards the landing target .
It &apos;s unbelievable .
We wondered , &quot; Do they actually glide in nature ? &quot;
Well we went to the forests of Singapore and Southeast Asia .
Look at the end to see the animal .
You see it there ? There ? Watch it come down .
Naomi Klein : Addicted to risk
I just did something I &apos;ve never done before .
I spent a week at sea on a research vessel .
This is the boat we were on , by the way .
It &apos;s still working its way up the food chain .
Now this shouldn &apos;t come as a surprise to us .
Thus the title &quot; Silent Spring . &quot;
Better to err on the side of caution .
Another explanation that you often hear for recklessness is hubris .
And you actually don &apos;t have a lot of options .
Don &apos;t feel ashamed .
Here &apos;s what I &apos;m talking about .
Let &apos;s hear from Tony Hayward again .
&quot; The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean .
A new bubble will replace the old one .
Now the problem is that the story was always a lie .
The Earth always did have limits .
They were just beyond our sights .
And now we are hitting those limits on multiple fronts .
How else to explain the cultural space occupied by Sarah Palin ?
The twin message is as comforting as it is mad .
Ignore those creeping fears that we have finally hit the wall .
There are still no limits .
There will always be another frontier .
So stop worrying and keep shopping .
This assessment , unfortunately , is far too optimistic .
And most controversially , it means the tar sands .
The oil is not liquid .
You can &apos;t just drill a hole and pump it out .
That &apos;s a person down there by the wheel .
My point is that this is not oil drilling .
It &apos;s not even mining .
It is terrestrial skinning .
Vast , vivid landscapes are being gutted , left monochromatic gray .
But , of course , our secular religion is technology .
So , solving the problem of pollution with more pollution .
Think of it as the ultimate junk shot .
An escape hatch has been reached .
A new frontier has been found .
We badly need some new stories .
That this is our only home .
There is no escape hatch .
Thank you .
Christoph Adami : Finding life we can &apos;t imagine
So I have a strange career .
No , no , I wasn &apos;t 14 years old .
But I &apos;m going to tell you about something else today .
And I was actually a rocket scientist .
But it was an exciting experience .
Yet , I had a very good answer .
I said , &quot; I have no idea . &quot;
And I said , &quot; What is that ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Really ?
Because isn &apos;t that easy ?
I mean , we have life .
But here &apos;s something . &quot;
And then you see something like that .
Anyone know ?
It &apos;s actually not life , it &apos;s a crystal .
Except that nowadays , it &apos;s heavily disputed .
So can life be defined ?
Well how would you go about it ?
And then you might get something .
And then you might come up with something like this .
And it says something complicated with lots and lots of concepts .
Why ? Because these things don &apos;t evolve by themselves .
In fact , they have hackers writing them .
And this was Steen Rasmussen .
But what is this system like ?
There &apos;s about 10,000 programs sitting here .
And all different strains are colored in different colors .
And this process goes on and on and on .
Can we measure this type of life ?
It &apos;s a robust signature , and it &apos;s very stable .
And here &apos;s the result .
So this also turns out to be extremely robust .
And it is detectable not just in amino acids .
Now you could ask : well , what about these Avidians ?
They have about 28 of these instructions .
Each of these instructions appears with roughly the equal frequency .
In this case , the frequency is lower .
So let &apos;s see what that looks like .
So first , nothing , nothing , nothing .
Too hot , too hot .
And of course , it reaches the viability threshold .
You hit the viability threshold .
The distribution changes to &quot; alive ! &quot;
And then that signature is lost .
What do we learn from that ?
And if you can do that , then you have life .
And I &apos;m going to leave you with that .
And thank you very much .
Jonas Gahr Støre : In defense of dialogue
And I can tell you , our agenda is full .
We loosely call them &quot; groups . &quot;
And we struggle with how to deal with them .
The red is modern conflict , conflicts within states .
So in a way , it is everybody &apos;s business .
They need political solutions .
And we have among states a reluctance in dealing with them .
It was black or white .
And groups are very often immediately label terrorists .
And who would talk to terrorists ?
Now I &apos;m not naive .
You cannot talk to everybody all the time .
And there are times you should walk .
And sometimes military intervention is necessary .
Let us turn to Afghanistan .
The situation , to be honest , is very serious .
We just have to persevere . &quot;
We can only solve this through a political solution .
Everybody seems to agree with that .
Now everybody agrees .
Because we didn &apos;t talk .
We didn &apos;t grasp what was going on .
And you can always walk .
It &apos;s hard , but it is necessary .
Let me go one step further .
This is Tahrir Square .
There &apos;s a revolution going on .
It will last for a long , long time .
And who knows what it will be called in the end .
That &apos;s not the point .
Social groups are taking to the streets .
Because we never talk to the people in these countries .
Should we talk to Hamas ?
If we talk to them , we may legitimize them . &quot;
I think that is wrong .
Because they may turn out to be a majority .
How will we ever be interlocutors ?
Now my diplomats are instructed to talk to all these groups .
But talking can be done in different ways .
Now talking can be accompanied with aid or not with aid .
Talking can be accompanied with inclusion or not inclusion .
It &apos;s their right to fight . &quot;
Now as you know , Mandela didn &apos;t do that .
Now South African friends will know that was very painful .
So what can we learn from all of this ?
We have to connect with these profound changes .
And what is dialogue really about ?
Sometimes you have to .
But that strategy seldom takes you very far .
The alternative is a strategy of engagement and principled dialogue .
We are seeing some new signs .
And they brought their knowledge .
This is perhaps a first element of a change .
We as diplomats need to know the social capital of communities .
The good thing is that we are not powerless .
Thank you for your attention .
Arianna Huffington : How to succeed ? Get more sleep
And my little idea that will do that is sleep .
This is a room of type-A women .
This is a room of sleep-deprived women .
And I learned the hard way , the value of sleep .
Two-and-a-half years ago , I fainted from exhaustion .
And I began the journey of rediscovering the value of sleep .
There is now a kind of sleep deprivation one-upmanship .
So a high I.Q.
And we &apos;ve had far too many icebergs hitting our Titanics .
Thank you .
Ahn Trio : A modern take on piano , violin , cello
Angella Ahn : Thank you .
Thank you so much .
What an exciting and inspiring event .
What you just heard is &quot; Skylife &quot; by David Balakrishnan .
We want to play you one more selection .
It &apos;s by Astor Piazzolla , an Argentine composer .
It was more atonal and twelve-tone .
And he insisted on beautiful music .
So this is &quot; Oblivion &quot; by Astor Piazzolla .
Thank you .
Arthur Benjamin : The magic of Fibonacci numbers
So why do we learn mathematics ?
Yeah ! I already have Fibonacci fans here .
That &apos;s great .
Now these numbers can be appreciated in many different ways .
Let me show you one of my favorites .
That &apos;s how they &apos;re created .
But check this out .
In fact , here &apos;s another one .
Let &apos;s see what we get there .
So one plus one plus four is six .
Add nine to that , we get 15 .
Add 25 , we get 40 .
Add 64 , we get 104 .
Now look at those numbers .
Do you see it ? I &apos;ll show it to you .
Fibonacci ! Of course .
Let &apos;s look at that last equation .
I &apos;ll show you by drawing a simple picture .
Together , they form a one-by-two rectangle .
Just as we created it .
That &apos;s the area .
So the area is also eight times 13 .
Now check this out .
If you divide 13 by eight , you get 1.625 .
Thank you very much .
Don Tapscott : Four principles for the open world
Openness . It &apos;s a word that denotes opportunity and possibilities .
Why is this happening ?
The technology revolution is opening the world .
Yesterday &apos;s Internet was a platform for the presentation of content .
The Internet of today is a platform for computation .
Collaboration can occur on an astronomical basis .
Now a new generation is opening up the world as well .
I call them the Net Generation .
I said , these kids are different .
It &apos;s like the air .
I &apos;m a digital immigrant .
I had to learn the language .
The global economic crisis is opening up the world as well .
I mean , think about Wall Street .
Now , what is openness ?
The first is collaboration .
His name is Rob McEwen .
I &apos;ve read some of your books . &quot;
I said , &quot; Great . What do you do ? &quot;
And he tells me this amazing story .
So he does a &quot; radical &quot; thing .
He gets submissions from all around the world .
You know , conventional wisdom says talent is inside , right ?
Your most precious asset goes out the elevator every night .
He viewed talent differently .
He wondered , who are their peers ?
They came from computer scientists , engineers .
He helped us understand that social media &apos;s becoming social production .
It &apos;s not about hooking up online .
This is a new means of production in the making .
Openness is about collaboration .
Now secondly , openness is about transparency .
And everywhere , our institutions are becoming naked .
I mean , one is , fitness is no longer optional .
You say you have good products .
They &apos;d better be good .
But you also need to have values .
So this is good . It &apos;s not bad .
Sunlight is the best disinfectant .
And we need a lot of sunlight in this troubled world .
Now this is different than transparency .
Transparency is about the communication of information .
Sharing is about giving up assets , intellectual property .
And there are all kinds of famous stories about this .
So we need to think differently about intellectual property .
I &apos;ll give you an example .
The pharmaceutical industry is in deep trouble .
Do you know about this ?
We need to reinvent the whole model of scientific research .
And I &apos;m not talking about the motherhood sense here .
The open world is bringing freedom .
Now , take the Arab Spring .
You know , one word : Tunisia .
You think that social media is about hooking up online ?
It was a tool of self-defense .
So this is a time of great change .
Now , it &apos;s not without its problems .
You can see this playing out today in Egypt .
But that doesn &apos;t matter , because this is moving forward .
The toothpaste is out of the tube .
I mean , we &apos;re not putting this one back .
The open world is bringing empowerment and freedom .
People didn &apos;t know about things .
There was no concept of progress .
You were born , you lived your life and you died .
So we saw the Protestant Reformation .
But it came with a cost .
The printing press gave us access to the written word .
The Internet enables each of us to be a producer .
The printing press gave us access to recorded knowledge .
Now , this thing has a function .
It protects the birds .
And there &apos;s leadership , but there &apos;s no one leader .
This is a huge collaboration .
Could we go beyond just sharing information and knowledge ?
Could we start to share our intelligence ?
Let &apos;s do this . Thank you .
Julian Treasure : The 4 ways sound affects us
First is physiological .
It &apos;s not just unpleasant sounds like that that do it .
This is surf .
It has the frequency of roughly 12 cycles per minute .
There is a deep resonance with being at rest .
We also associate it with being stress-free and on holiday .
The second way in which sound affects you is psychological .
Natural sound can do that too .
It &apos;s when they stop you need to be worried .
The third way in which sound affects you is cognitively .
Try and listen to the other one .
The fourth way in which sound affects us is behaviorally .
And that &apos;s not the only thing that bad sound damages .
At last we &apos;ve got some science we can apply .
And we &apos;re in the business of designing soundscapes .
I &apos;ll give you two examples .
Most of you recognize that immediately .
The younger , maybe not .
And most of you associate that with something !
Now , those are one-second samples of music .
There are eight expressions of a brand in sound .
I &apos;m glad to say that is starting to happen now .
1.8 billion times a day , that tune is played .
And it cost Nokia absolutely nothing .
That increases impact by over 1,100 percent .
That &apos;s an order of magnitude , up or down .
This is important .
Secondly , make it appropriate to the situation .
Don &apos;t just bombard them with stuff .
And , finally , test and test it again .
Sound is complex . There are many countervailing influences .
So I hope this talk has raised sound in your consciousness .
Thank you for lending me your ears today .
Christopher McDougall : Are we born to run ?
That &apos;s her competition .
She &apos;s under the underdogs .
Now this is when something really bizarre happens .
Derartu Tulu ruins the script .
So Paula Radcliffe , unfortunately , does it .
But then she falls back again .
Now the Tarahumara are remarkable for three things .
The Tarahumara had a different strategy .
They are free from all of these modern ailments .
So what &apos;s the connection ?
They &apos;re trying to solve those same kinds of mysteries .
Australopithecus had a tiny little pea brain .
We &apos;re not fast .
For some reason you guys are just really slow .
Her uterus would be torn .
Yes . You would have torn reproductive organs .
I &apos;ll give you an example .
They give you 48 hours to finish this race .
So you have these three mysteries .
Maybe we evolved as a hunting pack animal .
We &apos;re really good at being sweaty and smelly .
So what if we evolved as hunting pack animals ?
That &apos;s all we could do .
We could run really far on a hot day .
You need a pack to pull together .
The herd explodes and it gathers back again .
Those expert trackers have got to be part of the pack .
They can &apos;t be 10 miles behind .
They need to be part of the pack .
The pack stays together .
But maybe it &apos;s something different .
We try to cash in on it .
I didn &apos;t do yoga . I &apos;m not ready . &quot;
Humans ran and ran all the time .
We are here today . We have our digital technology .
So how do we get back to that again ?
Get rid of all the stinking running shoes .
So what &apos;s the benefit ? So what ?
So you burn off the Haagen-Dazs from the night before ?
But maybe there &apos;s another benefit there as well .
I &apos;ve experienced it personally myself .
So hopefully it &apos;s something we can all benefit from .
Jessa Gamble : Our natural sleep cycle
Let &apos;s start with day and night .
So , we have this ability as well .
So , what would our natural rhythm look like ?
They go to bed around 8 : 00 p.m.
So , cut to the modern day .
Thank you .
Maajid Nawaz : A global culture to fight extremism
or &quot; How could we have better prepared for that ? &quot;
In medieval societies there were defined allegiances .
An identity was defined primarily by religion .
In the age of globalization , we moved on .
And that &apos;s something which I &apos;d like to elaborate on .
We felt they were from the age of yesteryear .
We felt that they were out of date .
I learned how to effectively communicate across borders without being detected .
Eventually I was detected , of course , in Egypt .
And it &apos;s not just Islamist extremists that did this .
In certain countries , mosque minarets are being banned .
In others , headscarves are being banned .
Now that never would have been possible before .
Where does that leave democracy aspirants ?
Well I believe they &apos;re getting left far behind .
And I &apos;ll give you an example here at this stage .
So why are they succeeding ?
And why are democracy aspirants falling behind ?
It &apos;s comprised of ideas and narratives and symbols and leaders .
One of their leaders was killed in Pakistan recently .
So these symbols and these leaders come to your mind immediately .
And that &apos;s the power of social movements .
So that begs the next question .
And I believe that &apos;s for four reasons .
I believe , number one , it &apos;s complacency .
The second , I believe , is political correctness .
Let &apos;s bring the military back again . &quot;
Is it just about grievances ?
Is it just about a lack of education ?
And this is where I believe neoconservatism had it upside-down .
Now to conclude , how does that happen ?
Well , Egypt is a good starting point .
The Arab uprisings have demonstrated that this is already beginning .
We need to move one step beyond that now .
And it &apos;s with that thought that I &apos;ll end .
Susan Lim : Transplant cells , not organs
in the following year .
Next , raising the money to fund the procedure .
The transplant community has actively campaigned in organ donation .
Where and how can we draw the line ?
I was also pregnant at the time .
And in transplantation , concepts shifted from whole organs to cells .
I witnessed the technical difficulty .
Fat-derived stem cells are adult stem cells .
But adult stem cells are not embryonic stem cells .
In May 2006 , something horrible happened to me .
What lies ahead ?
Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide .
1.1 million Americans suffer heart attacks yearly .
4.8 million suffer cardiac failure .
Powerful new technologies always present enigmas .
Each one has his story .
Thank you .
Arvind Gupta : Turning trash into toys for learning
My name is Arvind Gupta , and I &apos;m a toymaker .
I &apos;ve been making toys for the last 30 years .
The early &apos; 70s , I was in college .
It was a very revolutionary time .
The National Movement of India was testimony to that .
So he designed and went and started a village science program .
Many people were inspired by this .
Live with them ; love them .
This was kind of the defining slogan .
Well I took one year .
And it was a turning point .
And one thing which I found was this black rubber .
This is called a cycle valve tube .
It &apos;s like its own little coupling .
And they have some wonderful properties .
You can just pull this out , this becomes a rectangle .
You give it a push , this becomes a parallelogram .
But this is very shaky .
Push it and it becomes house shaped .
This becomes an isosceles triangle -- again , very shaky .
This square might look very square and prim .
Give it a little push -- this becomes a rhombus .
It becomes kite-shaped .
Why use triangles ?
Because triangles are the only rigid structures .
They always make a triangular roof .
Now this is people science .
So you make all these 3D shapes .
You make a tetrahedron like this .
And once you make these , you make a little house .
Put this on top .
You just need a ton .
You can play around with it .
This makes an igloo .
Now this is in 1978 .
I was a 24-year-old young engineer .
And I thought this was so much better than making trucks .
I see hope . I see happiness in their faces .
Children want to make things . Children want to do things .
Now this , we make lots and lots of pumps .
And this is how you make a valve .
You put a little sticky tape .
This is one-way traffic .
Well we make lots and lots of pumps .
And this is the pump .
It &apos;s like a centrifuge .
If you spin something , it tends to fly out .
Many of our folk toys have great science principles .
If you spin-top something , it tends to fly out .
Right .
There are four pictures .
But this is great fun for children .
They all study about the food chain .
In three minutes , you just fold this up .
With a bigger one , you make a bigger one .
Now this is a pencil with a few slots over here .
And you put a little fan here .
And this is a hundred-year-old toy .
There have been six major research papers on this .
There &apos;s some grooves over here , you can see .
Six major research papers on this .
He wrote a paper on this .
This is a straw .
This is a kind of a blowing straw .
I just put this inside this .
There &apos;s a hole here , and I shut this .
What we do is make a very simple electric motor .
Now this is the simplest motor on Earth .
The most expensive thing is the battery inside this .
This is a permanent magnet .
Whenever current flows through the coil , this becomes an electromagnet .
We made 30,000 .
When teachers make it , children make it .
You can see a gleam in their eye .
They get a thrill of what science is all about .
And this science is not a rich man &apos;s game .
Over 100,000 children learn science this way .
And we &apos;re just trying to see possibilities .
They are fused together , so you can &apos;t separate them .
You put this in your mouth , and you blow .
And something very , very nice happens .
This is a touching slate meant for blind children .
And this is wool over here .
If I crank the handle , all the wool goes inside .
Wool sticks on Velcro .
And this has come as a great boon to them .
But this has come as a great boon for them .
There are no patents . Anyone can make it .
This is very , very simple .
These are two magnets .
Small pulley and two strong magnets .
And this fiber turns a wire attached to an LED .
There will be a spinning magnetic field .
And you can see , this LED is going to glow .
So this is a small crank generator .
And they &apos;d be absolutely joyous playing with this .
we use a lot of old newspapers to make caps .
This is worthy of Sachin Tendulkar .
It &apos;s a great cricket cap .
And you can see , this is a little fantail bird .
This is called &quot; The Captain &apos;s Hat Story . &quot;
The captain was a captain of a sea-going ship .
It goes very slowly .
It &apos;s been catapulted to international glory .
So that &apos;s a ship .
They were singing and dancing .
Suddenly there was a storm and huge waves .
And there &apos;s a third one over here .
This swallows the bridge and knocks it down .
Thank you so much .
Why are we so bad at detecting pancreatic cancer ?
That &apos;s older than my dad .
That &apos;s next to impossible .
I got everything for my homework from those two sources .
They &apos;re kind of like the superheroes of material science .
However , there &apos;s a catch .
So that &apos;s why I chose to use paper .
I can &apos;t really do cancer research on my kitchen countertop .
My mom wouldn &apos;t really like that .
So instead , I decided to go for a lab .
You &apos;re going to save us all ! &quot;
However , there was a silver lining .
So I went in that direction .
As you can never say no to a kid .
How unlikely is that ? I mean , pshhh .
But it wouldn &apos;t stop there .
It &apos;s just your ideas that count .
You could be changing the world .
Thank you .
Shereen El Feki : Pop culture in the Arab world
Yes . That &apos;s right . This is Barbie .
They have different interests . They have divergent values .
And should they ever come in contact ...
I want to show you two examples .
The first is 4Shbab .
: Video clips from across the globe .
The USA .
And they look something like this .
But it &apos;s not about fire and brimstone either .
Now , my second example is for a slightly younger crowd .
And it &apos;s called &quot; The 99 . &quot;
Now , these are the world &apos;s first Islamic superheroes .
They were created by a Kuwaiti psychologist called Naif Al Mutawa .
So , for example , there is the character of Noora .
Another character called Jami has the ability to create fantastic inventions .
It &apos;s now a theme park .
There is an animated series in the works .
We &apos;re not talking here about a clash of civilizations .
Nor is it some sort of indistinguishable mash .
Adam Grosser : A mobile fridge for vaccines
This is a problem .
Time for some thermodynamics .
And the story of the Intermittent Absorption Refrigerator .
It &apos;s one of those things that stuck in my head .
There &apos;s two spheres and they &apos;re separated in distance .
You heat up one side , the hot side .
The ammonia evaporates and it re-condenses in the other side .
But it was kind of an interesting thought .
We proved that most of the ammonia refrigeration tables are wrong .
So , this is the way it works .
You put it on a cooking fire .
Thank you .
David Cameron : The next age of government
And someone asked , &quot; Why ? &quot;
We have vast budget deficits .
That &apos;s the argument I want to make tonight .
So , starting with the political philosophy .
Of course we don &apos;t .
Local power , central power , now , people power .
So this was the pre-bureaucratic age .
Suddenly , you have the big , strong , central state .
It had sucked all that power up from the localities .
It was able to do that itself .
So , how could this happen ?
So , complete transparency will make a huge difference .
And the third of these big changes : accountability .
This , I think , is a huge change .
We &apos;re working with some of these people .
We want to get people to be more energy efficient .
How do you do it ?
I don &apos;t think they lasted very long .
Other examples are recycling .
We all know we need to recycle more .
How do we make it happen ?
So what does all this add up to ?
Thank you .
Charles Hazlewood : Trusting the ensemble
My job depends upon it .
That &apos;s all I have at the point of sale .
It &apos;s silent gesture .
I can hardly bark out instructions while we &apos;re playing .
Ladies and gentlemen , the Scottish Ensemble .
You overcompensate .
And in my game , that means you overgesticulate .
You end up like some kind of rabid windmill .
Bugger me , they wouldn &apos;t give it to me .
If you hold it too tightly , you crush it .
If you hold it too loosely , it flies away . &quot;
Let &apos;s be under no illusions .
So how do we recover from that , ladies and gentlemen ?
Simply through singing .
One of them was &quot; Carmen . &quot;
South Africans just make music really freely .
They don &apos;t read music .
They trust their ears .
Why is this ?
Did you know that TED is a tune ?
Now hang on a minute .
T , see it &apos;s the same as F in music .
So T is F.
Have a listen .
Do you hear it ?
Or do I smell some doubt in the room ?
If you &apos;ll pardon the expression .
I think we should make this even more explicit .
Ladies and gentlemen , it &apos;s nearly time for tea .
I think we need to sing for our tea .
Will you have a go for me ?
Audience : T , E , D.
Shall we try that one again ?
T , E , D.
Audience : T , E , D.
CH : Once more with vim .
There I am like a bloody windmill again , you see .
One more time , with feeling , ladies and gentlemen .
You won &apos;t make the key otherwise .
Well done , ladies and gentlemen .
So I decided to create a platform for that potential .
It &apos;s called Paraorchestra .
It was a really extraordinary moment .
Just me and four astonishingly gifted disabled musicians .
No one &apos;s listening . No one &apos;s trusting .
No one &apos;s responding to each other .
Nicholas : : My name &apos;s Nicholas McCarthy .
I &apos;m 22 , and I &apos;m a left-handed pianist .
And I was born without my left hand -- right hand .
Can I do that one again ?
I become alive .
It &apos;s removed some of my paralysis .
Paraorchestra is the name of that project .
You can imagine , the musicians were disconsolate .
Haydn remonstrated with the prince , but to no avail .
Courtney Martin : This isn &apos;t her mother &apos;s feminism
Thank you . Thank you for hip-hop -- and Anita Hill .
My parents were radicals -- who became , well , grown-ups .
I was raised with a very heavy sense of unfinished legacy .
Feminism was the water I grew up in .
You can see how this had an influence .
But she was not the only feminist in the house .
He &apos;s actually here today .
They were the co-authors of a book called &quot; Manifesta . &quot;
Fishnet stockings .
Jennifer Baumgardner was wearing them .
I thought they were really hot .
I decided , okay , I can claim the feminist label .
Anyone heard of these two guys as an example ?
My mom says , &quot; patriarchy . &quot;
I say , &quot; intersectionality . &quot;
Pay equity ? Yes . Absolutely a feminist issue .
But for me , so is immigration .
Thank you .
My mom says , &quot; Protest march . &quot;
I say , &quot; Online organizing . &quot;
Feminist blogging is basically the 21st century version of consciousness raising .
But we also have a straightforward political impact .
I realized feminism wasn &apos;t about man-hating and Birkenstocks . &quot;
My mom says , &quot; Gloria Steinem . &quot;
We don &apos;t want one hero .
We don &apos;t want one icon .
We don &apos;t want one face .
Thank you .
These are three words many of us were raised with .
It &apos;s enough to make you feel very overwhelmed .
Which brings me to my third paradox .
I wrote the book I needed to read .
Instead , what she really wanted to do was make films .
Cornel West says , &quot; Of course it &apos;s a failure .
But how good a failure is it ? &quot;
It &apos;s to say we operate on two levels .
It &apos;s about embracing the paradox .
It &apos;s about acting in the face of overwhelm .
And it &apos;s about loving people really well .
Thank you .
Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy : Inside a school for suicide bombers
In 2009 , there were 500 bomb blasts across Pakistan .
The Taliban now run their own schools .
We &apos;ve obtained a propaganda video made by the Taliban .
Hazrat Ali is from a poor farming family in Swat .
He joined the Taliban a year ago when he was 13 .
They ask us to use them only against the infidels .
Then they teach us to do a suicide attack .
SOC : Would you like to carry out a suicide attack ?
H If God gives me strength .
Effectively , this is the brainwashing process that has begun .
Now these children are primed to become suicide bombers .
I want you to watch another excerpt from the film .
This boy is called Zenola .
He blew himself up , killing six .
This boy is called Sadik .
He killed 22 .
This boy is called Messoud .
He killed 28 .
Do you want to carry out a suicide attack ?
Boy : I would love to .
But only if I get permission from my dad .
I have laid down my life fighting the infidels . &quot;
Then God will look at my intention .
Thank you .
So it is a one-company town .
And Electrolux was going to go to Mexico .
In fact , they did implode the factory .
I went from high school to factory .
My father worked at this factory , &quot; he said .
&quot; My grandfather worked at this factory .
All I know is how to make refrigerators . &quot;
Who is ever going to hire me ? &quot;
We got a problem , folks .
So it got me thinking , what is it ?
As we know , only half the states have opted in .
Because they see our passivity as their opportunity .
It &apos;s a rounding error on the federal side .
Why not ask all of the states to do that instead ?
In fact , every region of the country could do this .
Because Republican and Democratic governors love to cut ribbons .
We want to bring jobs . I &apos;m just saying .
Congress putting four and a half billion dollars on the table ?
They can &apos;t agree to anything . &quot;
Or , you renegades , we could go around Congress .
Go around Congress .
What if we created a private sector challenge to the governors ?
What if it all started here at TED ?
And we can get in the game or not .
Thank you all so much .
Alex Steffen : The route to a sustainable future
Fill in the blanks .
So , you know , sustainability , small planet .
Right ? Picture a little Earth , circling around the sun .
One of them is that every society has an ecological footprint .
We &apos;re using up about five planets .
Clearly we don &apos;t have 10 planets .
We don &apos;t have that . So that &apos;s one problem .
And people simply do not have enough to survive .
A third of the people on this planet are kids .
And they may not want to live exactly like us .
Everybody in this room has heard the worst-case scenarios .
I don &apos;t need to go into that .
But I will ask the question , what &apos;s the alternative ?
We don &apos;t know how to do this yet .
So what &apos;s Worldchanging ?
Talk about the kinds of things we &apos;re scoping out .
Give you a little peek into our editorial notebook .
So you have density . You also have growth management .
You leave aside what is natural to be natural .
This is in Portland . That is an actual development .
That land there will remain pasture in perpetuity .
They &apos;ve bounded the city with a line .
Nature , city . Nothing changes .
You can also start to change what you build .
You can start to know where things are .
When you share them , you end up using less .
We could just re-label things .
How we build things can change as well .
This is a bio-morphic building .
It takes its inspiration in form from life .
We &apos;re starting to cover this more and more .
So this , for example , is hydrogen-generating algae .
They live in the emerging megacities of the developing world .
It &apos;s every seven days .
Most of those cites are growing incredibly quickly .
So I rather like this picture here .
And those things lead to things like this .
This is a Telecentro in Sao Paulo .
I particularly like the little Linux penguin in the back .
It &apos;s doing something new . There &apos;s new things happening .
Another world is possible .
We tweak that a lot .
How many people knew of Lula before today ?
I would keep your eye on this fellow .
You get -- this is a building in Hyderabad , India .
It &apos;s the greenest building in the world .
You get access to distance medicine .
You get new tools for people in the developing world .
Here &apos;s a design for distilling water using sunlight .
Here &apos;s a way of transporting water .
I mean , that &apos;s a great design .
This is a fabulous invention , LifeStraw .
This is one of my favorite Worldchanging kinds of things ever .
How do we help people like that ?
New models for pedagogy for the displaced .
And we have new tools .
This is one of my absolute favorite things anywhere .
Does anyone know what this is ?
Audience : It detects landmines .
Alex Steffen : Exactly , this is a landmine-detecting flower .
You know , that it &apos;s not just enough to survive .
And I think that we will .
I hope that that turns out to be true .
Thank you very much .
Rives : A story of mixed emoticons
This means , &quot; I &apos;m smiling . &quot;
So does that .
This means &quot; mouse . &quot;
&quot; Cat . &quot;
Here we have a story .
Here &apos;s where it happens .
These are when .
She wears it every day .
Look at her posture ; it &apos;s remarkable .
That &apos;s because she dances .
And he could say , &quot; Oh my God ! &quot;
or &quot; I heart you ! &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m laughing out loud . &quot;
&quot; I want to give you a hug . &quot;
But he comes up with that , you know .
Put a crab inside it .
Add some water .
Seven different salts .
And the girl goes , &quot; Wha &apos; ? &quot;
I think my heartbeat might be the Morse code for inappropriate .
At least , that &apos;s how it seems .
I &apos;m a monkey -- -- blowing kisses at a butterfly .
But I &apos;m still suggesting you and I should meet .
First , soon , and then a lot .
Hell , ponytail alone .
I don &apos;t know what else to tell you .
I got a pencil you can borrow .
You can put it in your phone . &quot;
She just says , &quot; No thank you . &quot;
You know ?
Pamela Meyer : How to spot a liar
Also , the person to your left is a liar .
Also the person sitting in your very seats is a liar .
We &apos;re all liars .
I can &apos;t even get a coffee date at Starbucks .
My husband &apos;s like , &quot; Honey , deception ?
Your eyebrow twitched . You flared your nostril .
Its power emerges when someone else agrees to believe the lie .
Truth number one about lying : Lying &apos;s a cooperative act .
Now not all lies are harmful .
We say , &quot; Nice song . &quot;
So sorry . &quot;
But there are times when we are unwilling participants in deception .
And that can have dramatic costs for us .
That &apos;s an eyelash under a trillion dollars .
That &apos;s seven percent of revenues .
Deception can cost billions .
Think Enron , Madoff , the mortgage crisis .
Deception is actually serious business .
He was interviewed once , and he said the following .
And that &apos;s the crux of it .
And we all kind of hate to admit it .
Now granted , many of those are white lies .
Now when we first hear this data , we recoil .
We can &apos;t believe how prevalent lying is .
We &apos;re essentially against lying .
But if you look more closely , the plot actually thickens .
We lie more to strangers than we lie to coworkers .
Extroverts lie more than introverts .
Women lie more to protect other people .
Now you may think that &apos;s bad .
If you &apos;re unmarried , that number drops to three .
Lying &apos;s complex .
We &apos;re deeply ambivalent about the truth .
That &apos;s truth number two about lying .
It &apos;s as old as breathing .
Lying has evolutionary value to us as a species .
Now you might remember Koko .
Does anybody remember Koko the gorilla who was taught sign language ?
Koko was taught to communicate via sign language .
Here &apos;s Koko with her kitten .
It &apos;s her cute little , fluffy pet kitten .
We &apos;re hardwired to become leaders of the pack .
It &apos;s starts really , really early .
How early ?
One-year-olds learn concealment .
Two-year-olds bluff .
Five-year-olds lie outright .
They manipulate via flattery .
Nine-year-olds , masters of the cover up .
It &apos;s been very confusing for a long time now .
What do you do ?
Trained liespotters get to the truth 90 percent of the time .
The rest of us , we &apos;re only 54 percent accurate .
Why is it so easy to learn ?
We &apos;re going to start with speech .
Bill Clinton : I want you to listen to me .
I &apos;m going to say this again .
And these allegations are false .
Thank you .
Pamela Meyer : Okay , what were the telltale signs ?
Well first we heard what &apos;s known as a non-contracted denial .
We also heard distancing language : &quot; that woman . &quot;
Freud had it right .
And we all do it no matter how powerful you are .
We all chatter with our fingertips .
Let the science temper your knowledge a little bit .
Because we think liars fidget all the time .
We think liars won &apos;t look you in the eyes .
We think warmth and smiles convey honesty , sincerity .
Can you all spot the fake smile here ?
You can consciously contract the muscles in your cheeks .
Now we &apos;re going to look at the hot spots .
Can you tell what &apos;s happening in a conversation ?
An honest person is going to be cooperative .
They &apos;re going to show they &apos;re on your side .
They &apos;re going to be enthusiastic .
We rehearse our words , but we rarely rehearse our gestures .
We tell very convincing stories , we slightly shrug our shoulders .
John Edwards : I &apos;d be happy to participate in one .
So I know it &apos;s not possible .
But I &apos;m happy to participate in one .
Murderers are known to leak sadness .
It &apos;s still somewhat of a healthy relationship .
But when anger turns to contempt , you &apos;ve been dismissed .
It &apos;s associated with moral superiority .
Here &apos;s what it looks like .
It &apos;s marked by one lip corner pulled up and in .
It &apos;s the only asymmetrical expression .
Science has surfaced many , many more indicators .
Now here &apos;s the deal .
These behaviors are just behaviors .
They &apos;re not proof of deception .
They &apos;re red flags .
We &apos;re human beings .
They don &apos;t mean anything in and of themselves .
Don &apos;t be too aggressive , it doesn &apos;t work .
And these were surfaced by researcher David Matsumoto in California .
That bothers me the most .
And she fought , and I know she fought you .
And I don &apos;t understand it , and I never will .
Liespotters rely on human tools .
Our world is lit up 24 hours a day .
It &apos;s a much more noisy world .
And that &apos;s the truth . Thank you .
Apollo Robbins : The art of misdirection
Do you think it &apos;s possible to control someone &apos;s attention ?
Even more than that , what about predicting human behavior ?
I think those are interesting ideas , if you could .
Great . Double-check .
Make sure you still have them on you .
I was doing some shopping beforehand .
You just looked at your clock , right ?
Close your eyes .
Now , you &apos;ve been watching me for about 30 seconds .
With your eyes closed , what am I wearing ?
Make your best guess .
What color is my shirt ? What color is my tie ?
Now open your eyes .
By a show of hands , were you right ?
For me , I like to call him Frank .
So Frank is sitting at a desk .
What just happened ? Do you have a wallet ?
Do you have an American Express in your wallet ?
And when I do that , your Frank turns around .
He accesses the file . He has to rewind the tape .
Just hold still where you are .
You did a wonderful job onstage .
Do you have your ring as well ?
Good . Just taking inventory . You &apos;re like a buffet .
Hi , how are you ? Good to see you .
Oh , you &apos;re married . You follow directions well .
That &apos;s nice to meet you , sir .
Hi , sir , how are you ?
Apollo Robbins : Well , we &apos;ll find one for you .
Come on up this way , Joe .
Give Joe a round of applause .
Come on up Joe . Let &apos;s play a game .
Pardon me .
Thank you very much . I appreciate that .
AR : Money . All right , let &apos;s try that .
Can you stand right over this way for me ?
Now this is a task for you to focus on .
I &apos;m not ready for that kind of commitment .
It was a big miscommunication .
So let &apos;s do this simply . Squeeze your hand .
Joe : Very . AR : Good .
Open your hand . Thank you very much .
I &apos;ll cheat if you give me a chance .
Make it harder for me . Just use your hand .
Grab my wrist , but squeeze , squeeze firm .
Did you see it go ?
Go ahead and take it off .
Now , let &apos;s try that again .
Squeeze firm . You &apos;re human , you &apos;re not slow .
It &apos;s back on your shoulder .
Yet you had something inside your front pocket .
Do you remember what it was ?
Joe : Money .
I &apos;m going to try to push it inside your hand .
Put your other hand on top for me , would you ?
It &apos;s amazingly obvious now , isn &apos;t it ?
Hold your hands together . Put your other hand on top .
It &apos;s not back on your shoulder .
Did you see it go ?
That &apos;s great . I need help with this one .
Step over this way for me .
Can I feel the outside of your pocket for a moment ?
Joe : Yeah . I &apos;m saving it for later .
Hopefully it matches his taste .
Joe , thank you very much .
What am I wearing ?
Attention is a powerful thing .
Like I said , it shapes your reality .
Thank you .
Daniel Goldstein : The battle between your present and future self
All right , so tie me to the mast . &quot;
I want to hear that song . Untie me . &quot;
And the first mate wisely resists and doesn &apos;t untie Odysseus .
And the first mate hesitates .
So he unties Odysseus , and Odysseus flips out .
He &apos;s like , &quot; You idiot . You moron .
Now just don &apos;t untie me no matter what . &quot;
He throws the first mate to the ground .
Hilarity ensues .
There is first , the present self .
This is like Odysseus when he &apos;s hearing the song .
He just wants to get to the front row .
But then there &apos;s this other self , the future self .
So why do we need commitment devices ?
It &apos;s physically possible to lose weight .
It &apos;s physically possible to exercise more .
But resisting temptation is hard .
It &apos;s in control . It &apos;s in power right now .
And the future self is not even around .
It &apos;s off in the future . It &apos;s weak .
It doesn &apos;t even have a lawyer present .
There &apos;s nobody to stick up for the future self .
And so the present self can trounce all over its dreams .
Now I &apos;m a big fan of commitment devices actually .
Such it is with commitment devices .
I think self-discipline is something , it &apos;s like a muscle .
The more you exercise it , the stronger it gets .
And this is a timely issue .
I &apos;m talking about the topic of saving .
Now saving is a classic two selves problem .
The present self does not want to save at all .
It wants to consume .
Whereas the future self wants the present self to save .
So this is a timely problem .
So what can we do about this ?
On the one hand , it sounds ridiculous .
And I &apos;ll show you some of these tools right here .
The first is called the distribution builder .
Now you can try to move your outcomes around .
It means that you have to save more today .
And what it is is an exploration into virtual reality .
So this is one of our experiments .
Other conditions show people the future self .
So for instance , here is somebody using the tool .
And just watch the facial expressions as they move the slider .
The younger face gets happier and happier , saving nothing .
The older face is miserable .
And then it &apos;s a high savings rate .
The younger face is getting unhappy .
The older face is quite pleased with the decision .
Your decisions today are going to determine its well-being .
And that &apos;s something that &apos;s easy to forget .
This is actually a picture of Hal , my coauthor .
You might recognize him from the previous demos .
And I &apos;ll close it there .
Thank you .
Hanna Rosin : New data on the rise of women
Not a lot of women did .
The &apos; 20s and the &apos; 60s also come to mind .
And I realized that two things were different this time around .
And now look at this second set of slides .
Women , a majority of the workplace .
And labor statistics : women take up most managerial jobs .
That particular headline comes to me from a market research firm .
But in fact , they found something very surprising .
Now what does that mean ?
This has been going on for 40 years now .
There we go .
So what &apos;s that about ?
But of course , it &apos;s not about that .
But that really isn &apos;t true anymore .
You would be issuing orders from above .
You would be very hierarchical .
You would tell everyone below you what to do .
But that &apos;s not what an ideal leader is like now .
And those are all things that women do very well .
So that &apos;s childcare , elder care and food preparation .
And here the story is fairly simple .
Women are getting college degrees at a faster rate than men .
Why ? This is a real mystery .
Noa : The girls are obviously smarter .
I mean they have much larger vocabulary .
They learn much faster .
They are more controlled .
On the board today for losing recess tomorrow , only boys .
Hanna Rosin : And why is that ?
HR : So there you go .
And this was kind of a shocker to me .
So who were they ?
And this was very disheartening for them .
&quot; That &apos;s your salary .
So who &apos;s the man now ? &quot; he asked them .
&quot; Who &apos;s the damn man ?
She &apos;s the man now . &quot;
And that really sent a shudder through the room .
It &apos;s happening all over the world .
And now look at the chart .
That &apos;s from 1985 to 2003 .
How much do you prefer a first-born son ?
And they come up in lots of different forms .
So we have the perpetual adolescent .
We have the charmless misanthrope .
You &apos;ve got Lady Gaga .
And it &apos;s not just for the young , right ?
Even Helen Mirren can hold a gun these days .
Now I &apos;ve never really liked this term .
And we &apos;re always below the glass ceiling , the women .
What crazy person would pop their head through a glass ceiling ?
You can bring your husband along .
Thanks very much .
George Monbiot : For more wonder , rewild the world
This is why wars get fought .
I was , I believe , ecologically bored .
Now , I don &apos;t romanticize evolutionary time .
Nor was it authenticity that I was looking for .
I don &apos;t find that a useful or even intelligible concept .
But there are two in particular that fascinate me .
The first one is the mass restoration of ecosystems .
It sounds strange , but just follow me for a while .
And beavers , like wolves , are ecosystem engineers .
They create niches for other species .
But here &apos;s where it gets really interesting .
The wolves changed the behavior of the rivers .
They began to meander less .
There was less erosion . The channels narrowed .
Whales in the southern oceans have similarly wide-ranging effects .
But the opposite happened .
Why would that possibly have happened ?
Here are the whales changing the composition of the atmosphere .
The other one is the rewilding of human life .
And I don &apos;t see this as an alternative to civilization .
What megafauna , you say ?
Well , every continent had one , apart from Antarctica .
They are elephant-adapted .
It was a lot bigger than the Asian elephant .
Perhaps because they evolved to resist browsing by rhinoceros .
Thank you .
Robert Thurman : We can be Buddhas
Thank you .
All the young people , actually , from the city .
They wouldn &apos;t go listen to him .
But the young people all came .
It just becomes intolerable .
We do enjoy our misery in a certain way .
Who &apos;s going to get enough out of the world ?
It would be terrible .
But apparently , this is a strange paradox of life .
You know , we really learned everything in the &apos; 60s .
And we feel ourselves differently . It &apos;s totally strange .
It &apos;s totally strange .
And then it &apos;s never good enough .
They didn &apos;t help at all .
And so then he looks at me .
He feels the way they are harvesting yaks nowadays .
And yet he &apos;s very jolly . He &apos;s extremely jolly .
It &apos;s really lovely .
The human being is almost out of time .
The human being is compassion because what is our brain for ?
Now , Jim &apos;s brain is memorizing the almanac .
And he would have tremendous fun doing that .
It is Nirvana .
Thank you .
Claron McFadden : Singing the primal mystery
Folks , you &apos;ve just met Claron McFadden .
Her celebrated operatic roles are numerous and varied .
Please welcome Claron McFadden .
I can &apos;t make noise .
She said , &quot; Please , sing for me . &quot;
The emotions can flow from me to you and back .
Extremely profound experience .
It &apos;s called &quot; Aria . &quot;
It was written for an amazing singer called Cathy Berberian .
No notes , no flats , no sharps .
And there &apos;s different text .
There &apos;s Armenian , Russian , French , English , Italian .
So within this structure one is free .
So I would like to share this piece with you .
It &apos;s &quot; Aria &quot; of John Cage .
Andrea Ghez : The hunt for a supermassive black hole
How do you observe something you can &apos;t see ?
So , what is a black hole ?
And I &apos;m going to only talk about the mass .
So , this is a little tricky .
So why is it so important ?
At that point , what &apos;s going to happen ?
At that point gravity wins .
Gravity wins over all other known forces .
And then it &apos;s a black hole .
It depends only on the mass of the object .
Bigger objects have bigger Schwarzschild radii .
Smaller objects have smaller Schwarzschild radii .
So , now we know what a Schwarzschild radius is .
I only need two things .
And your job today is to be skeptical .
On an astronomical scale that &apos;s a very small black hole .
There are big ones . There are little ones .
Almost every object in that picture there is a galaxy .
So , we see the galaxy because of the star light .
Now , there are a few relatively exotic galaxies .
And we call them active galactic nuclei .
It &apos;s way more energetic .
There are also jets emanating out from the center .
But it &apos;s a kind of indirect argument .
And what we see is a line of stars .
Which is the job that I have to show you today .
It &apos;s the gravitational pull that makes these things orbit .
And that is because of the atmosphere .
And that buys us about a factor of 20 .
So , without this technology you can &apos;t see the stars .
With this technology all of a sudden you can see it .
So , I want to see how these things have moved .
Absolutely my favorite star in the world .
And that &apos;s because it goes around in only 15 years .
That &apos;s kind of profound , in a way .
You can see a lot of stars .
Now , truth in advertising . Right ?
And the truth is , I &apos;m not quite there .
And that &apos;s the fun .
So , let me give you the two examples .
And it &apos;s a very fragile entity .
And what does the big black hole do ?
It strips that gas cloud apart .
So , you shouldn &apos;t see young stars .
So , what do we see ?
The old ones are red .
So , you can already see the surprise .
There is a dearth of old stars .
So , this is the fun part .
So , we want to build a 30 meter telescope .
Thanks very much .
Ryan Lobo : Photographing the hidden story
I found this photography of mine almost compulsive .
In 2007 , I traveled to three war zones .
I traveled to Iraq , Afghanistan and Liberia .
I would feel very isolated during these discussions .
Photography transcended culture , including my own .
He got his name from fighting stark naked .
This woman witnessed the General murdering her brother .
Today the General is a baptized Christian evangelist .
And he &apos;s on a mission .
He forgives the General in this image .
In this photograph a hostile crowd in a slum surrounds him .
And Joshua remains silent as they vented their rage against him .
I was intensely moved during all this .
But the question is , does forgiveness and redemption replace justice ?
They use negotiation and tolerance more often than an armed response .
And that they were definitely capable of diffusing it non-aggressively .
And yes , all of those people killed were male .
They answer more than 5,000 calls in just two months .
Something amazing happened during this shoot .
These men were terrified , as the mob attacked our vehicle .
Now , hundreds of homes were destroyed .
Where does such rage come from ?
And how are we responsible for this ?
They lack even the most basic amenities .
In India we often love to complain about our government bodies .
And that &apos;s the power of storytelling .
Lucianne Walkowicz : Finding planets around other stars
Can you see it ?
There we go .
And I &apos;ll tell you why .
This is our star . This is our Sun .
It &apos;s shown here in visible light .
They also cause the light from the star to vary .
However , these are just the tip of the iceberg .
Thank you .
Diébédo Francis Kéré : How to build with clay ... and community
I am a native of Burkina Faso .
I am an example of that .
I was born in a little village called Gando .
Today , not so much has changed .
There is still no electricity in my village .
But I was lucky .
I had a scholarship .
I could go to Germany to study .
But what to do with this privilege ?
I just wanted to use my skills and build a school .
Fundraising was not an easy task .
So I had to convince everybody .
I was allowed to use even traditional techniques .
And then the polishers come .
They start polishing it with a stone for hours .
It &apos;s not photoshopped .
This is the school , built with the community .
And the kids , they love it .
It has opened up opportunities to do more projects in Gando .
The first one is the school extension , of course .
I started to build a prototype like that .
The innovation was to build a clay vault .
The community is looking . It still works .
So we can build .
And we kept building , and that is the result .
The kids are happy , and they love it .
The community is very proud . We made it .
And even animals , like these donkeys , love our buildings .
The next project is the library in Gando .
Something we have in Gando are clay pots .
We wanted to use them to create openings .
The openings are letting the hot air out and light in .
Very simple .
My most recent project in Gando is a high school project .
I would like to share with you this .
How do you cast mud ?
And sometimes I can leave .
They will do it themselves .
I came to speak to you like that .
Another factor in Gando is rain .
Don &apos;t confound with Christo and Jeanne-Claude .
It is simply how we protect our walls .
But for us , the rain is good .
We just wait for the rain to go .
That is it .
But you will be surprised . I &apos;m still alive .
There &apos;s a new quality in this work .
Yes , you know it .
I have won a lot of awards through this work .
For sure , it has opened opportunities .
I have become myself known .
In my culture , this is a symbol of deep affection .
As a seven-year-old guy , I was impressed .
Merci beaucoup .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
Joachim de Posada : Don &apos;t eat the marshmallow !
And it was found close to here , Stanford .
Exact equivalent .
So what happened when the professor left the room ?
As soon as the door closed ...
two out of three ate the marshmallow .
Some lasted 14-and-a-half minutes .
Couldn &apos;t do it . Could not wait .
Would look at it .
Put it back .
Self-discipline : the most important factor for success .
What did they find ?
They had good grades . They were doing wonderful .
They were happy . They had their plans .
They had good relationships with the teachers , students .
They were doing fine .
They did not make it to university .
They had bad grades . Some of them dropped out .
A few were still there with bad grades .
A few had good grades .
So I went to Colombia . And I reproduced the experiment .
And let me show you what happened .
So what happened in Colombia ?
But she ate it .
But she will be successful .
And this applies for everything . Even in sales .
That person ate the marshmallow .
If the sales person says , &quot; Wait a second .
Then you sell a lot more .
So this has applications in all walks of life .
I end with -- the Koreans did this .
They are teaching these kids exactly this principle .
We are eating more marshmallows than we are producing .
Thank you so much .
Gregory Stock : To upgrade is human
It felt wrong to do that in some way .
I &apos;m focusing on biology , the biological sciences .
the areas that are the most significant to us .
It &apos;s because we &apos;re flesh and blood .
We &apos;re biological creatures .
I think that Shakespeare really put it very nicely .
And then from hour to hour we rot and rot .
And thereby hangs a tale . &quot;
Life is short , you know .
And we need to think about planning a little bit .
This is where it &apos;s really central to our lives .
You just have to look at the Human Genome Project .
We &apos;re deciphering the code of codes .
We &apos;re reading the book of life .
You know it &apos;s 2003 , and there is no HAL .
And we &apos;re still picking up pieces of the Challenger .
And this is very critical stuff .
This is not the stomping ground of our Pleistocene ancestors .
It &apos;s going to happen a lot sooner than people imagine .
It &apos;s going to change the way we have children .
It &apos;s going to probably change the human lifespan .
is the revolution in biology .
But who is going to pay for all this ?
And how are we going to understand all this complex information ?
That &apos;s going to have amazing impacts .
The approval process is going to fall apart , actually .
It &apos;s too slow .
It &apos;s too risk-averse .
It would change absolutely everything .
The second is modifying our emotions .
You know , this is just clumsy little baby steps .
Probably not .
Why do you do what you do ?
We &apos;re sort of circumventing evolutionary programs that guide our behavior .
It &apos;s going to be very challenging to deal with .
The third area is reproduction .
The first is cloning .
It didn &apos;t happen .
It &apos;s a total media circus .
It will happen in five to 10 years .
It &apos;s already done to avoid rare diseases today .
Of course there is going to be genetic engineering .
They &apos;ll want the new release .
They are really going to come to operate in this realm .
Now not everything that can be done should be done .
And it won &apos;t be done .
Humanity is going to go down this path .
And it &apos;s going to do so for two reasons .
It is being funded very very -- in a big way .
The second is , we &apos;re human .
That &apos;s what we do .
That &apos;s really the central one , I believe .
People can try and ban these things .
They undoubtedly will . They have .
It &apos;s going to drive these things from view .
So , sure , we need to debate these things .
And I think it &apos;s wonderful that we do .
That is simply not going to happen .
They touch us too deeply .
Other people are going to say , &quot; This is great .
This is the flowering of human endeavor . &quot;
It &apos;s not going to happen .
And that &apos;s where about half of our drugs come .
In fact this isn &apos;t just abstract .
So here we are .
And they are actually going to romanticize this moment in time .
You know it &apos;s a little bit like a birth .
Where there is this bloody , awful mess happens .
And then what comes out of it ? New life .
We &apos;re going to make lots of errors .
That &apos;s the way these things work .
It will always be remembered .
I think that we should be proud of it .
We are , definitely .
It &apos;s how we hold it in our hearts .
It &apos;s how we look at it .
Thank you .
Philip Zimbardo : The demise of guys ?
Other than that , there &apos;s not much of a problem .
So what &apos;s the data ?
So the data on dropping out is amazing .
In Canada , five boys drop out for every three girls .
Two-thirds of all students in special ed. remedial programs are guys .
What &apos;s the evidence of wiping out ?
First , it &apos;s a new fear of intimacy .
And we &apos;re seeing a steady increase among males .
And this is two kinds .
It &apos;s a social awkwardness .
The old shyness was a fear of rejection .
The problem is these are arousal addictions .
Drug addiction , you simply want more .
Arousal addiction , you want different .
Drugs , you want more of the same -- different .
And the problem is the industry is supplying it .
The average boy now watches 50 porn video clips a week .
And there &apos;s some guy watching a hundred , obviously .
So what &apos;s the solution ? It &apos;s not my job .
No offense to banana slug owners . Thank you .
Ivan Krastev : Can democracy exist without trust ?
Basically you believe in complexity , but not in ambiguity .
As you have been told , I &apos;m Bulgarian .
But then the rain stopped , people went to vote .
The government and the opposition , they have been simply paralyzed .
Because you know what to do about the protests .
You know who to arrest , who to negotiate with .
So the government decided to have the elections once again .
Democracy is the only game in town .
I mean the unemployed , the under-privileged .
And this is a major issue .
And I &apos;ll start with what went right .
It was the human rights moment .
But after that you have the market revolution of the 1980s .
And you have more choice-driven societies .
And it was the birth of the global world .
And you have the Internet .
The very idea of political community totally has changed .
So this is what went right .
All this was very much under attack .
Now we have the reverse tendency .
Now the elites basically have been liberated .
They &apos;re very mobile . You cannot tax them .
And basically they don &apos;t fear the people .
This is also partly a result of the Internet revolution .
This is the other side of the things that we like .
Before , revolutions used to have ideological names .
You have Facebook revolutions , Twitter revolutions .
This is probably true .
Transparency is not about restoring trust in institutions .
Transparency is politics &apos; management of mistrust .
This is why you have checks and balances .
But is this the idea of a free society ?
So for me this is extremely important .
But also don &apos;t forget , any unveiling is also veiling .
And the public was extremely all for it .
Thank you very much .
Alanna Shaikh : How I &apos;m preparing to get Alzheimer &apos;s
I &apos;d like to talk about my dad .
My dad has Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
That &apos;s a lot of people .
That &apos;s what happened with my dad .
He got dementia anyway .
So I &apos;m preparing to get Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
It &apos;s confusing to watch television , and often very frightening .
And reading is just about impossible .
Would they give me charts and graphs that I could color ?
That all seems like win to me .
even when it &apos;s so hard .
I don &apos;t want to get Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
Thank you .
Dan Pink : The puzzle of motivation
I need to make a confession at the outset here .
To put it mildly , I didn &apos;t do very well .
Thank you .
I don &apos;t want to tell you a story .
I want to make a case .
This is called the candle problem .
Some of you might have seen this before .
It &apos;s created in 1945 by a psychologist named Karl Duncker .
Doesn &apos;t work .
It &apos;s an awesome idea . Doesn &apos;t work .
The key is to overcome what &apos;s called functional fixedness .
This shows the power of incentives .
Here &apos;s what he did . He gathered his participants .
To the second group he offered rewards .
It &apos;s a nice motivator .
Question : How much faster did this group solve the problem ?
That &apos;s not how it &apos;s supposed to work . Right ?
Bonuses , commissions , their own reality show .
Incentivize them . That &apos;s how business works .
But that &apos;s not happening here .
It dulls thinking and blocks creativity .
And I &apos;m telling you , it &apos;s not even close .
That &apos;s actually fine for many kinds of 20th century tasks .
Let me show you what I mean .
Same deal . You : we &apos;re timing for norms .
You : we &apos;re incentivizing .
What happened this time ?
You want to be looking around .
That reward actually narrows our focus and restricts our possibility .
Let me tell you why this is so important .
Software can do it faster .
Low-cost providers around the world can do it cheaper .
Think about your own work .
Think about your own work .
The rules are mystifying .
Now , I mean it makes me crazy .
And this is not -- here &apos;s the thing .
This is not a feeling .
This is not a philosophy .
I &apos;m an American ; I don &apos;t believe in philosophy .
Let me give you an example of what I mean .
Lets go to Madurai , India and test this . &quot;
Standard of living is lower .
What happens ?
Is this some kind of touchy-feely socialist conspiracy going on here ?
And do you know who sponsored this research ?
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States .
That &apos;s the American experience .
We need a whole new approach .
It &apos;s an approach built much more around intrinsic motivation .
Autonomy : the urge to direct our own lives .
I want to talk today only about autonomy .
Management did not emanate from nature .
Okay ? Somebody invented it .
And it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s going to work forever .
Management is great .
Traditional notions of management are great if you want compliance .
But if you want engagement , self-direction works better .
Let me give you some examples .
How many of you have heard of the company Atlassian ?
It looks like less than half .
Atlassian is an Australian software company .
And they do something incredibly cool .
Work on anything you want . &quot;
And then , being Australians , everybody has a beer .
They call them FedEx Days .
Why ? Because you have to deliver something overnight .
Okay ? Radical amounts of autonomy .
In a ROWE people don &apos;t have schedules .
They show up when they want .
They just have to get their work done .
Meetings in these kinds of environments are optional .
What happens ?
And I say , &quot; Nope . I have proof . &quot;
The mid-1990s , Microsoft started an encyclopedia called Encarta .
A few years later another encyclopedia got started .
Different model , right ?
Do it because you like to do it .
If they went head to head , who would win ? &quot;
This is the titanic battle between these two approaches .
This is the Ali-Frazier of motivation . Right ?
This is the Thrilla &apos; in Manila .
Alright ? Intrinsic motivators versus extrinsic motivators .
And here is what science knows .
Two : Those if-then rewards often destroy creativity .
The drive to do things cause they matter .
I rest my case .
Gayle Tzemach Lemmon : Women entrepreneurs , example not exception
We do not invest in victims , we invest in survivors .
You can &apos;t count what you don &apos;t see .
And we don &apos;t invest in what &apos;s invisible to us .
But this is the face of resilience .
And that turned out to be women .
So I was amazed .
Why are you so passionate ? &quot;
And that &apos;s really how I became an entrepreneur . &quot;
So maybe you could interview her . &quot;
And she was just the start .
So these stories together became the Herald Tribune business cover .
But think about this .
Most people say women .
Why is that ?
They want to move from micro to medium and beyond .
And in many places , they &apos;re there .
China , women run 20 percent of all small businesses .
They are often ignored because they &apos;re harder to help .
She sells chocolates .
The great news is we already know what works .
Theory and empirical evidence Have already taught us .
And that &apos;s just to start .
I think that is terrific .
You know why ?
So the great news is this is an incredible opportunity .
We have so much room to grow .
Now that makes me pause for just a couple reasons .
&quot; You will find a job . Take the leap . &quot;
The women in my family are not exceptions .
The women in this room and watching in L.A.
and all around the world are not exceptions .
We are not a special interest group .
We are the majority .
And it is time for all of us to think bigger .
Thank you very much .
Mitchell Joachim : Don &apos;t build your home , grow it !
Why grow homes ? Because we can .
Right now , America is in an unremitting state of trauma .
And there &apos;s a cause for that , all right .
We &apos;ve got McPeople , McCars , McHouses .
As an architect , I have to confront something like this .
Well , it &apos;s been around for 2,500 years .
It fits into the environment . It is the environment .
It is the landscape , right ?
They &apos;re perfect .
And what we do is we grow extracellular matrix from pigs .
We use a modified inkjet printer , and we print geometry .
It &apos;s victimless . It &apos;s meat from a test tube .
And we know it &apos;s incredibly ugly .
That &apos;s why we grow homes . Thanks very much .
Little did I know that it was mine as well .
&quot; Huhuhuhuhuhuhuhahahahaha . &quot;
But somehow , it didn &apos;t matter about the publicity .
There was no money involved .
The village square was filled with hundreds of people .
And they put on an opera all night long .
Human beings needed the light .
They needed the light to see .
I start with the notion of the ideograph .
Three strokes , you get the whole bamboo forest .
What is the abstraction ?
The circle . The circle . It &apos;s so obvious .
The circle of life . The circle of Mufasa &apos;s mask .
And you see the mechanics .
You don &apos;t question that .
I love the apparent truth of theater .
I love that people are willing to fill in the blanks .
You took pieces of sticks .
You added silk to the bottom .
And in a way , that is what makes it spiritual .
That &apos;s what moves you .
It &apos;s not the actual literal sunrise that &apos;s coming .
It &apos;s the art of it .
And I &apos;m one who loves high tech and low tech .
I did it always with a male Prospero .
Prospera : At first sight , they have changed eyes .
Miranda : Do you love me ?
Ferdinand : Beyond all limit .
HM : They are both in either &apos;s powers .
Trinculo : Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows .
Looking for business , governor ?
Caliban : Hast thou not dropped from heaven ?
Stephano : Out of the moon , I do assure thee .
Prospera : Caliban !
Caliban : This island is mine .
Sebastian : Draw thy sword .
And I , the king , shall love thee .
Prospera : I will plague them all , even to roaring .
Ariel : I have made you mad .
Prospera : We are such stuff as dreams are made on .
and our little life is rounded with a sleep .
JT : Okay .
And all of a sudden , the audience &apos;s perspective changes .
It becomes something magically large .
It becomes the rainstorm .
Now I &apos;m going to take you to &quot; Spider-Man . &quot;
Spider Man is not bound by gravity .
Manhattan in the show is not bound by gravity either .
It &apos;s real , what &apos;s happening .
Bono : They &apos;re mythologies .
They &apos;re modern myths , these comic book heroes .
Circus , rock &apos; n &apos; roll , drama .
What the hell are we doing up there on that stage ?
Well , one last story , very quickly .
Did you hear the lyrics ?
To my right is sheer shale . It &apos;s coming off .
And no hiking boots .
I know you &apos;ve all been there .
I &apos;m in the crucible right now .
It &apos;s my trial by fire .
It &apos;s my company &apos;s trials by fire .
We survive because our theme song is &quot; Rise Above . &quot;
Boy falls from the sky , rise above .
I know you understand that .
Thank you .
Pearl Arredondo : My story , from gangland daughter to star teacher
My dad was a high-ranking gang member who ran the streets .
Man , her office was packed .
But that doesn &apos;t mean that we can &apos;t .
It just takes a little bit more .
Not so much .
It was gang-infested , huge teacher turnover rate .
I took a school bus to the fancy side of town .
You had to survive .
You just had to do things sometimes .
She has an issue with authority .
She &apos;s not going to go anywhere . &quot;
Some teachers completely wrote me off as a lost cause .
And boy , they were like , &quot; What ? Why ?
Why would you want to do that ? &quot;
And I am going to be their help along the way .
So as a rookie teacher , I created opportunity .
How do you get to build those relationships ?
So we created a new school .
And we created the San Fernando Institute for Applied Media .
We wanted those freedoms .
But we had to do it .
Our community deserved a new way of doing things .
Yeah , what if we get it wrong ?
But what if we get it right ?
And we did .
So in our third year , how did we do it ?
Well , we &apos;re making school worth coming to every day .
We make our kids feel like they matter to us .
Animation , software , moviemaking software , they have it all .
These were played in the local trolley system .
Thank you .
Mustafa Akyol : Faith versus tradition in Islam
There was no separation of sexes .
In other words , men and women were worshiping all together .
They were together while praying .
And I noticed this in a very funny way .
I left the Kaaba to eat something in downtown Mecca .
I headed to the nearest Burger King restaurant .
Quite ironic .
But apparently that was not an issue at the time .
So the rituals came that way .
And these were traditions of the Middle East -- medieval traditions .
There is a practice called female circumcision .
It &apos;s something terrible , horrible .
It is basically an operation to deprive women of sexual pleasure .
It was there for thousands of years .
And quite tellingly , some Muslims do practice that .
The Muslims in North Africa , not in other places .
And we see truly in some Muslim communities that tradition .
It should be the citizen &apos;s decision .
But the secular-minded people can be influenced by that .
And there are strengths in Islamic tradition .
You can derive many ideas from that .
But besides that , I also saw problems within Islamic tradition .
The Koran , for example , doesn &apos;t condone stoning .
There is no punishment on apostasy .
There is no punishment on personal things like drinking .
That interpretation is quite possible and feasible .
But that &apos;s not the case at all .
The context has changed .
And when you have colonization what do you have ?
You have anti-colonization .
That &apos;s one thing to remember .
And Arab masses just revolted against their dictators .
They were asking for democracy ; they were asking for freedom .
They said that &quot; we want freedom ; we want democracy .
Of course , this is a long road .
Democracy is not an overnight achievement ; it &apos;s a process .
But this is a promising era in the Muslim world .
Thanks so much .
Keller Rinaudo : A mini robot -- powered by your phone
Not very many of you .
So a couple .
That &apos;s okay .
This robot can &apos;t be creepy or uncanny .
He should be friendly and cute .
So meet Romo .
When Romo wakes up , he &apos;s in creature mode .
If I duck down , he &apos;ll follow me .
If I come over here -- He &apos;s smart .
Thanks , little guy .
Bless you .
So here &apos;s the iPad .
And Romo will actually stream video to this device .
If I get in front of Romo here .
I &apos;ve always wanted a picture of a 1,500-person TED audience .
So I &apos;ll snap a picture .
So there are all of you through Romo &apos;s eyes .
You do not have to teach someone how to drive Romo .
In fact , who would like to drive a robot ?
Okay . Awesome .
Here you go .
Thank you , Scott .
Thanks , Scott .
They change from person to person .
To be honest , I have no idea .
Thank you .
Greg Asner : Ecology from the air
Technology can change our understanding of nature .
Take for example the case of lions .
You &apos;ve heard this too , I can tell .
They just use a different strategy .
So how can we save what we don &apos;t understand ?
The hottest pinks are the fastest-growing plants .
I want to share three of those questions with you today .
That &apos;s all ships , airplanes , trains and automobiles combined .
Basically , we need a high-tech accounting system .
The colors are going to be going from red to blue .
You &apos;re seeing the buffer zone around the Panama Canal .
That &apos;s in the reds and yellows .
The forest is on the left .
Here you see actual data showing different species in different colors .
This puts incredible pressure and responsibility on park management .
Some of their decisions have really big impacts .
Going forward , I plan to greatly expand the airborne observatory .
Thank you .
Shukla Bose : Teaching one child at a time
And I &apos;m not a trained academic .
Neither am I a veteran social worker .
The first thing that we did was walk through the slums .
How many children will you get ?
How are you going to scale ?
How are you going to replicate ? &quot;
So , we started Parikrma .
That was our first school . One hundred sixty-five children .
Indian academic year begins in June .
My God ! What a bonding exercise that was .
Now , when you talk global you have to talk English .
And so all our schools are English medium schools .
No one in their family has spoken English .
No one in their generation has spoken English .
But how wrong it is .
The vocabulary used in those books and the style of writing .
They &apos;ll never be able to cope . &quot;
That &apos;s absolute hogwash .
Fathers have started to attend .
Now they have started writing their signature .
The children have taught them .
It &apos;s amazing how much children can teach .
We had 25 mothers who came regularly after school to study .
Ninety-eight percent of our fathers are alcoholics .
We have about three fathers who have been trained to cook .
We have taught them nutrition , hygiene .
I mingled with almost everyone .
They were very friendly .
Even now we are in touch through Facebook .
Before that I feel like I wasn &apos;t like this .
My accent with English improved a lot .
And today she wants to be a neurologist .
Our children are doing brilliantly in sports .
They are really excelling .
We &apos;ve got the best school award for three years successively .
We also have our very own dream team .
Why is this happening ? Why this confidence ?
Art , music are considered therapy and mediums of expression .
We didn &apos;t hire McKinsey to do a business plan .
This is five-year-old Parusharam .
He &apos;s in kindergarten .
He has learned how to speak English .
I like eating . I like playing . &quot;
Now , &quot; horsing &quot; is going for a horse ride .
So , Parusharam comes to my office every day .
But today I have been transformed .
I have been changed with my children .
Thank you .
Richard St. John : 8 secrets of success
She said , &quot; What leads to success ? &quot;
And the first thing is passion .
Did he say fun ? Rupert ? Yes !
TEDsters do have fun working . And they work hard .
I figured , they &apos;re not workaholics . They &apos;re workafrolics .
And push ! David Gallo says , &quot; Push yourself .
You gotta push through shyness and self-doubt .
Goldie Hawn says , &quot; I always had self-doubts .
I wasn &apos;t good enough ; I wasn &apos;t smart enough .
I didn &apos;t think I &apos;d make it . &quot;
Because that &apos;s the way people really get rich . &quot;
I &apos;d say it was a pretty good idea .
And I give lots of evidence .
You gotta persist through failure . You gotta persist through crap !
Thank you TEDsters for all your interviews !
Annie Lennox : Why I am an HIV / AIDS activist
And this is the name of my campaign : SING Campaign .
You can see the bars of the window there .
It was quite a momentous occasion for all of us .
I have to serve . &quot;
I met him at a 46664 event .
He was wearing a t-shirt like the one I wear now .
It doesn &apos;t have to be in the closet . &quot;
They work in the field .
They have education programs .
They bring out the issues of stigma .
It &apos;s quite extraordinary what they do .
So this is my SING Campaign .
This is in the Scottish Parliament .
I &apos;ve subsequently become an envoy for Scotland and HIV .
This can happen .
Now that is prevention at the very beginning of life .
This is Avelile -- she goes with me wherever I go .
Avelile had the virus , she was born with the virus .
The doctors and nurses were phenomenal .
This is the transformation that took place .
Isn &apos;t it extraordinary ?
And I take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation .
Thank you very much .
Annie Murphy Paul : What we learn before we &apos;re born
My subject today is learning .
Ready ?
When does learning begin ?
Now I &apos;m a science reporter .
I write books and magazine articles .
And I &apos;m also a mother .
How can we know this ?
Babies quickly show their preference by choosing the first one .
Now why would this kind of fetal learning be useful ?
It may have evolved to aid the baby &apos;s survival .
It &apos;s also tastes and smells .
Now it turns out that fetuses are learning even bigger lessons .
And often it does something more .
Will it be born into a world of abundance or scarcity ?
The specter of mass starvation loomed .
But others wouldn &apos;t be discovered for many years .
Why would undernutrition in the womb result in disease later ?
But that may not be all that &apos;s going on .
Here &apos;s another story .
1,700 of these people were pregnant women .
But there &apos;s another way of thinking about PTSD .
Let me be clear .
Thank you .
Steven Pinker : Human nature and the blank slate
&quot; Do you have tenure ? &quot;
They are : the arts and parenting .
Let me start with the arts .
Well , in fact , the arts are not in decline .
Well , here &apos;s a diagnosis .
And here &apos;s just one example .
Well , you get the idea .
People are staying away from elite art and criticism .
What a puzzle -- I wonder why .
But it certainly inspired an energetic reaction from many university professors .
Well , the other hot button is parenting .
Well , here &apos;s some sobering facts about parenting .
The genetically controlled studies have some sobering results .
That would make them super-similar , right ?
OK -- two different bodies of research with a similar finding .
And that presents us with a choice .
Thank you very much .
Lewis Pugh : How I swam the North Pole
He was a great storyteller .
He had been there and watched it go off .
He also told me about the great explorers .
I really , really wanted to go to the Arctic .
There was something about that place which drew me to it .
I love the place .
And we need to do something about it right now .
Fresh water freezes at zero .
And the water at the North Pole is minus 1.7 .
It &apos;s fucking freezing .
I assembled this team of 29 people from 10 nations .
It couldn &apos;t be further from the truth for me .
And I had to visualize the swim .
I had to taste the salt water in my mouth .
I felt confident that I could actually do this swim .
So we stopped the ship , as you do .
I have never in my life felt anything like that moment .
I could barely breathe . I was gasping for air .
I swam as hard as I could for five minutes .
I remember just trying to get out of the water .
I climbed out of the ice .
There is no possibility that this was going to happen .
He accidentally fell through the ice into the sea .
We are going to actually have to take them off . &quot;
This is such an important swim .
There were open patches of sea everywhere .
And then we walked out onto the ice .
I had never seen black water before .
And it is 4,200 meters deep .
Just scuttle forward and go for it . &quot;
We &apos;ve just seen our first polar bears .
It was absolutely magical .
A mother and a cub , such a beautiful sight .
It &apos;s a very frightening , very , very frightening thought .
It &apos;s all a little bit frightening , and emotional .
Amundson , you ready ? Amudson : Ready .
Take the goggles off . Take the goggles off !
Take the shoes . Take the shoes .
You did it ! You did it man !
LP : How on earth did we do that ?
Against the current ! You did it against the current !
LP : Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
Thank you so much .
Audience : Encore !
But was it worth it ? Yes , absolutely it was .
You saw during that video all those flags .
Those flags represented the countries from which my team came from .
Britain , America , Japan , South Africa , the Congo .
We need to believe in ourselves .
Now is the time to believe .
We &apos;ve come a long way . We &apos;re doing good .
Ladies and gentlemen , thank you very , very much .
Dan Ariely : Beware conflicts of interest
So , I was in the hospital for a long time .
And what &apos;s the brilliant idea he had ?
It sounded interesting . He asked me to go and shave .
What would happen then ? &quot;
&quot; We have lasers ; we can whiten it out . &quot;
Do you enjoy looking non-symmetric ?
Do you have some kind of perverted pleasure from this ?
None of those happened .
But I decided not to have this treatment .
Where was this guilt trip coming from ? &quot;
Now you probably think that this guy &apos;s a schmuck .
Right , that &apos;s what he seems like .
So I looked carefully at this guy .
He was 20-some years older than anybody else in the sample .
Who would ever include a drunken guy in a sample ? &quot;
What would have happened if he was in the other group ?
Would we have thrown him out then ? &quot;
I wasn &apos;t doing something bad .
But this was not the case .
I do want to leave you with one positive thought .
Sebastian Thrun : Google &apos;s driverless car
As a boy , I loved cars .
Like this .
So we decided at Stanford to build a different self-driving car .
We built the hardware and the software .
Yet I still hadn &apos;t saved a single life .
We &apos;ve driven 140,000 miles .
It &apos;s the perfect driving mechanism .
We &apos;ve driven in cities , like in San Francisco here .
Oh , my God .
What ?
Second It &apos;s driving itself .
You could regain this time .
This is four billion hours wasted in this country alone .
And it &apos;s 2.4 billion gallons of gasoline wasted .
Thank you .
Derek Sivers : Keep your goals to yourself
Everyone , please think of your biggest personal goal .
Imagine deciding right now that you &apos;re going to do it .
Imagine their congratulations and their high image of you .
Doesn &apos;t it feel good to say it out loud ?
So , let &apos;s look at the proof .
So , if this is true , what can we do ?
Well , you could resist the temptation to announce your goal .
Exactly , well done .
John Francis : Walk the earth ... my 17-year vow of silence
Thank you for being here .
And I said , &quot; Thank you for being here . &quot;
Well , I want to take you on this journey .
That &apos;s a big thing in California .
You &apos;re walking to make us feel bad . &quot;
Because of the oil , everybody talked about the polllution .
I called my parents up .
I didn &apos;t know about the environment then .
They &apos;re back in Philadelphia .
Mothers are like that .
And so I did .
And what I heard , it kind of disturbed me .
And then I would launch in .
Well , that just ended communication .
So on this first day I actually listened .
I was 27 . I thought I knew everything .
I didn &apos;t .
Well , that lasted 17 years .
It &apos;s only 500 miles .
I had a newspaper clipping .
You don &apos;t … ?
We have a special program for you . &quot; They did .
And my father came out , he was so proud .
I said I &apos;d be there in about two years .
There are two stories in Montana .
And they said , &quot; Don &apos;t worry about that . &quot;
So I did that .
And during that time , I actually taught classes without speaking .
I had 13 students when I first walked into the class .
All the students sat around and they went ...
They had to take that class with me .
&quot; Well , you can &apos;t clearcut with a ... &quot;
&quot; Yes , you can clear cut ... &quot;
And so I went on .
I spent two years there writing on oil spills .
No one was interested in oil spills .
But something happened -- Exxon Valdez .
My dad came out again .
Well , I put on my backpack again .
And that &apos;s communication .
Well , my journey kept going on .
&quot; Yeah , I want to make a difference . &quot;
&quot; You &apos;re going to make a difference , buddy . &quot;
How could that be , how could that be ?
I started talking because I had studied environment .
And so that &apos;s the message that I had .
And I started walking off .
What possessed me to say this thing ?
The road turned into the jungle .
I didn &apos;t get shot .
I was a prisoner and I needed to escape .
Now how could that be ?
I had no idea I would have a Ph.D.
You know , we can do it .
I was going to have to change .
I didn &apos;t know who I would be if I changed .
But I know I needed to .
We have to change now .
Thank you .
Arthur Benjamin : Teach statistics before calculus !
And it would be easy to implement and inexpensive .
And at top of that pyramid , it &apos;s calculus .
It &apos;s one of the great products of the human mind .
The laws of nature are written in the language of calculus .
It &apos;s risk . It &apos;s reward . It &apos;s randomness .
It &apos;s understanding data .
Not only -- thank you -- not only that ...
It &apos;s analyzing trends . It &apos;s predicting the future .
Look , the world has changed from analog to digital .
Thank you very much .
Stephen Wolfram : Computing a theory of all knowledge
It &apos;s the idea of computation .
But there &apos;s actually a lot more to computation than that .
But what about the space of all possible programs ?
Here &apos;s a representation of a really simple program .
Very simple .
Now we get another result , still very simple .
Try changing it again .
You get something a little bit more complicated .
So the question is : Can anything else happen ?
Well , we can do a little experiment .
They &apos;re called cellular automata .
You can see a lot of diversity in the behavior here .
So here it is .
Things with rules as simple as these can do it .
People like Leibniz had wondered about that too 300 years earlier .
So let &apos;s give it a try .
Let &apos;s start off with something really easy .
Hope for the best .
Very good . Okay .
So far so good .
Let &apos;s try something a little bit harder .
We could ask it something about the real world .
And it should be able to tell us that .
let &apos;s say the revenue of Microsoft .
So let &apos;s say we have a lab finding that ...
But that &apos;s just the beginning .
So , I &apos;m pretty pleased with it all .
You know , we have a fairly interesting situation right now .
Let me show you a couple of examples here .
So here &apos;s a trivial piece of Mathematica programming .
But it &apos;s something that is very precise stuff .
So what happens when you put these things together ?
I think it &apos;s actually rather wonderful .
Here &apos;s a real simple example .
Let &apos;s try this here .
I &apos;ll show you one example here .
This is just an example of one of these computable documents .
There &apos;s an inexhaustible supply of programs out there .
So , will we find the whole of physics ?
Not an easy project .
One &apos;s got to build a lot of technology .
Thank you .
That was astonishing .
Stay here . I &apos;ve got a question .
Benoit Mandelbrot is in the audience .
Does your work relate to his ?
SW : I think so .
Stephen Wolfram , thank you .
Aditi Shankardass : A second opinion on developmental disorders
And it was while I was doing my Ph.D.
But here &apos;s what really perplexed me .
It seemed so intuitive to me .
It turned out that Justin was almost certainly not autistic .
One more mind will be unlocked .
And all this by simply watching the child &apos;s brainwaves .
Thank you .
Jonathan Drori : Why we &apos;re storing billions of seeds
All human life , all life , depends on plants .
Just think for a moment .
All these things , they come back to plants .
And without them we wouldn &apos;t be here .
Now plants are under threat .
They &apos;re under threat because of changing climate .
I think it does .
is by storing seeds .
But it goes down below ground many stories .
And it &apos;s the largest seed bank in the world .
This is a nuclear-proof facility .
God forbid that it should have to withstand that .
And those are the dry land species .
So first of all we did deals with 50 different countries .
They search for them . They find them in flower .
And they go back when their seeds have arrived .
And they collect the seeds . All over the world .
The seeds -- some of if is very untechnical .
And this is a distributed network .
So all around the world people are doing the same thing .
And that enables us to develop germination protocols .
And that is very useful information .
And that &apos;s already happening .
So where have we got to ?
Twenty-five percent of all the world &apos;s plants , by 2020 .
This is at least 100 times bigger .
These seeds are used for restoration .
Fantastically useful plant , both for protein and for medicine .
How much does it cost ?
2,800 dollars per species is the average .
I think that &apos;s cheap , at the price .
And we &apos;re almost there .
Thank you very much .
Hillel Cooperman : Legos for grownups
So , these are the Dark Ages .
That stuff &apos;s cool . &quot;
Walked into the Lego store .
Bought him this .
It &apos;s totally appropriate for a four-year-old .
Pretty soon it got a little bit out of control .
The dining room looked like this .
You walk there , and it hurts .
Torture , very funny .
Wow , you guys are great .
I was like , &quot; Yeah .
I suppose we are . &quot;
Whatever .
So then you realize there are these conventions .
And you &apos;re like , &quot; Holy shit !
Just beautiful .
I &apos;m coming out .
And it &apos;s pretty amazing actually .
I have to take a moment .
Okay . Anyway .
The insides were Lego .
This is amazing what you can do .
This is my house .
And this is my house .
Anyway , I &apos;m out of time .
Because there aren &apos;t enough TED logos around here .
Let &apos;s see here .
Okay .
Ta-da .
Ross Lovegrove : Organic design , inspired by nature
I was hanging on to have a pee .
I &apos;m in that world , but I work purely instinctively .
So , the water bottle .
I &apos;ll begin with this concept of what I call DNA .
Industrial design is the art form of the 21st century .
I work from a similar position .
It &apos;s my impression of water .
I use , now , a whole new process .
This is all created digitally .
This is the background noise of industrial design .
That is like an Anish Kapoor flowing through a Richard Serra .
It felt like nothing . It has to feel like nothing .
It fits arthritic hands . It fits children &apos;s hands .
It makes the product strong , the tessellation .
It &apos;s a millefiori of ideas .
It doesn &apos;t look as cool , does it ?
I took this video in Cape Town last year .
This is the freaky side coming out .
How do you condense that ?
It comes back to instinct .
It &apos;s a weird , kind of freaky place .
This is one of my specimens .
It &apos;s made from polysaccharides and proteins .
If you pour water on that , it dissolves .
Could we be manufacturing from foodstuffs in the future ?
It &apos;s the world &apos;s first chair made in magnesium .
This is an absolutely beautiful way of working .
It &apos;s a godly way of working .
It &apos;s organic and it &apos;s essential .
This is an idea for a gas-injected , one-piece polymer chair .
It takes away anything extraneous . That &apos;s what I do .
I make organic things which are essential .
I set out to look at natural forms .
This is a show that &apos;s currently on in Tokyo .
In his day , he was the highest taxpayer in Britain .
That is the power of organic design .
This is my artwork . This is all my process .
These actually are sold as artwork .
I &apos;ll tell you about that later .
It &apos;s for a company called Moroso in Italy .
It &apos;s a gas-injected polymer chair .
The coring out of the back lets you breathe .
This is some current work I &apos;m doing .
I have a big show with Phillips Auctioneers .
Single-surface products . Furniture &apos;s a good one .
How you grow legs out of a surface .
I don &apos;t know . If I just got some time .
What is our dream ? How do we beat Apple ? &quot;
What a waste . Anyway .
That is an image of a car for me .
Cars are all wrong .
I &apos;m going to show you something a bit weird now .
They laughed everywhere over the world I showed this .
The only place that didn &apos;t laugh was Moscow .
Its cars are made from 30,000 components .
It opens and closes like a bread bin .
You plug them in . Off you jolly well go .
You see that thing . You do .
You do and not anaesthetized , separated from life .
Can you imagine ? A car on a stick .
And that &apos;s what I do with my furniture .
I &apos;m not putting Charles Eames &apos; furniture in buildings anymore .
Forget that . We move on .
I &apos;m trying to build furniture that fits architecture .
I &apos;m trying to build transportation systems .
This is the steriolithography of a staircase .
I built this thing for my studio .
It cost me 250,000 dollars to build this .
This is the data that goes with that . Incredibly complex .
Lean , efficient things . Healthy products .
Modern materials allow us to do modern things .
This is a shot in the studio .
This is how it looks pretty much every day .
Who cares ?
That &apos;s my studio . It &apos;s subterranean .
It has a lighting system that changes throughout the day .
You never see architects or designers showing you their real world .
This is called a &quot; Plasnet . &quot;
It &apos;s a bio-polycarbonate new chair I &apos;m doing in Italy .
World &apos;s first bamboo bike with folding handlebars .
We should all be riding one of these .
The first sculptural model I made for that thing in Tokyo .
It &apos;s made from Kevlar .
We need to have a new instinct for the 21st century .
We need to combine all this stuff .
These are my sculptures .
A copper jelly mold .
So , it &apos;s going to end .
Thank you , James , for your great inspiration .
Thank you very much .
Beverly + Dereck Joubert : Life lessons from big cats
And here &apos;s a prime example .
Well , we needn &apos;t have worried .
And right now this is in the Okavango Delta in Botswana .
And surprisingly , it became a cult film .
But that &apos;s not always easy for us .
Sleep deprivation is extreme .
I had tears rolling down my cheeks .
And I do believe you should stay with us .
And you can see the start of it here .
This elephant , against overwhelming odds , simply gives up hope .
Now back to the leopard .
These are precious to us , these divides .
So we knew we had to react quickly .
It was like watching a graduation ceremony .
We felt like we were surrogate parents .
DJ : Okay , so she was a little bit rough .
But in fact , what we were seeing here was interesting .
They ended up sleeping for hours .
We had to deal with these individual personalities .
We had to deal with them with respect and celebrate them .
Leopards have plummeted from 700,000 down to a mere 50,000 .
It &apos;s simply not sustainable .
DJ : There &apos;s a burgeoning bone trade .
South Africa just released some lion bones onto the market .
I call it complacency -- our complacency .
They &apos;re essential to the habitat .
If they disappear , whole ecosystems in Africa disappear .
There &apos;s an 80-billion-dollar-a-year ecotourism revenue stream into Africa .
If they disappear , all of that goes away .
That is the situation we &apos;re in -- the last lions .
And Legadema ?
BJ / DJ : Thank you very much .
BLA My journey to yo-yo mastery
When I was 14 years old , I had low self-esteem .
I felt I was not talented at anything .
One day , I bought a yo-yo .
When I tried my first trick , it looked like this .
A bit better .
I found my passion .
I was spending all my time practicing .
And I won .
I realized society didn &apos;t value my passion .
I felt I was not alive anymore .
I passed an audition for Cirque du Soleil .
Luca Turin : The science of scent
So what you &apos;re smelling now is the top note .
I will show it to you .
And after that , the complete fragrance .
And do not get the impression that this is very subjective .
You are all smelling pretty much the same thing , OK ?
Smell has this reputation of being somewhat different for each person .
It &apos;s not really true .
But the first theory is : it must be the shape .
And the other theory is that we smell molecular vibrations .
Now , this is a totally insane idea .
Here &apos;s how shape works in normal receptors .
The way --I expect everybody to memorize these compounds .
Working for a fragrance company .
Because there &apos;s a lot of money in sandalwoods .
So this is a profoundly inefficient process .
A theory is something that enables you to do less work .
This is cis-3-hexene-1-ol . It smells of cut grass .
It &apos;s very hard to explain this by molecular recognition .
S-H , quite a different frequency .
If you look on this , imagine a piano keyboard .
You have a unique smell , a unique vibration .
The bad news is they &apos;re rocket fuels .
And this is the main objection to the theory .
This is a joke . I &apos;m a biologist , OK ?
So it &apos;s a joke against myself .
Unlike us , they won &apos;t fall off the cliff .
And so that &apos;s a direct path to making new odorants .
And it is the classic synthetic aroma chemical , OK ?
And the prediction is it should smell of coumarin .
They made it ... and it smelled exactly like coumarin .
And this is our new baby , called tonkene .
And people are very resistant to ideas , and rightly so .
Why should new ideas be accepted ?
And people often ask me , is your theory accepted ?
But we &apos;re not actually doing it by astrology .
Thank you very much .
Marvin Minsky : Health and the human mind
Most people will say , &quot; Emotions are terribly hard .
But that &apos;s not the hard part . &quot;
So here &apos;s a list of problems that come up .
One nice problem is , what do we do about health ?
Or maybe it was 31 and a quarter percent .
Education : how do we improve education ?
Pollution , energy shortage , environmental diversity , poverty .
How do we make stable societies ? Longevity .
Okay , there &apos;re lots of problems to worry about .
And then notice that a great many of these problems disappear .
The problem is , how many people should there be ?
And it &apos;s a sort of choice we have to make .
Timesharing is a little further off in the future .
The future must have some computers . &quot;
Therefore , we have to build super intelligent machines like HAL .
So one thing we can do is live longer .
So that &apos;s one way of going about it .
Which , by chimpanzee standards , is very good indeed .
And so there won &apos;t be any workforce .
So I see emotions as highly evolved subsets of your capability .
Thank you .
Taylor Wilson : Yup , I built a nuclear fusion reactor
So my name is Taylor Wilson .
So nuclear fusion is our energy future .
That is the inside of my nuclear fusion reactor .
I decided I wanted to make a star .
I don &apos;t see any nuclear power plants with fusion energy .
Well it doesn &apos;t break even .
I built this in my garage .
And I &apos;ve developed a system to produce medical isotopes .
So that &apos;s my fusion reactor in the background there .
That is me at the control panel of my fusion reactor .
So maybe I don &apos;t want to admit to that .
So thank you very much .
Luis von Ahn : Massive-scale online collaboration
How many of you found it really , really annoying ?
Okay , outstanding . So I invented that .
Or I was one of the people who did it .
That thing is called a CAPTCHA .
CAPTCHAs are used all over the Internet .
So this is an example from the Yahoo registration page .
This person thought they needed to wait .
So let me tell you what this project started .
But then I started feeling bad .
So then I started feeling bad .
Your brain is doing something that computers cannot yet do .
So let me explain how this works .
Google has one . The Internet Archive has one .
You &apos;ve seen those things , right ? Like a book ?
It gives you an image for every page of the book .
Now the problem is that OCR is not perfect .
So this is how the system works .
So for example , Ticketmaster .
Twitter and about 350,000 other sites are all using reCAPTCHA .
So funny things can happen .
For example , we presented this word .
So we get this .
Oops .
Here &apos;s another really bad one .
JohnEdwards.com So we keep on insulting people left and right everyday .
Now , of course , we &apos;re not just insulting people .
I &apos;m sure some of you have heard about it .
Here &apos;s how it works .
That &apos;s how it works .
There are tens of thousands of these .
Some of them are very cute .
Some of them are funnier .
Okay , so this is my favorite number of reCAPTCHA .
And it is numbers like these that motivate my research agenda .
It hasn &apos;t yet been launched . It &apos;s called Duolingo .
Since it hasn &apos;t been launched , shhhhh !
Yeah , I can trust you &apos;ll do that .
So this is the project . Here &apos;s how it started .
Okay , that &apos;s Severin Hacker .
So I posed the question to my graduate student .
First of all , translating the Web .
So right now the Web is partitioned into multiple languages .
A large fraction of it is in English .
So that &apos;s what I would like to do .
Why can &apos;t we use machine translation ?
Why can &apos;t we use it to translate the whole Web ?
It makes a lot of mistakes .
Actually it was a forum post .
It was translated from Japanese into English .
So I &apos;ll just let you read .
So he &apos;s just explaining something .
Remember , it &apos;s a question about JavaScript .
Then comes the first part of the question .
Then comes my favorite part of the question .
Okay , so computer translation , not yet good enough .
So back to the question .
So we need people to translate the whole Web .
We could pay professional language translators to translate the whole Web .
We could do that .
Unfortunately , it would be extremely expensive .
It &apos;s about 20 percent of the size of English .
So it would be very expensive .
The first one is a lack of bilinguals .
That &apos;s a big problem .
Normally , you have to pay people to do this .
There &apos;s a way to kill two birds with one stone .
there are over 1.2 billion people learning a foreign language .
People really , really want to learn a foreign language .
So people really , really want to learn a new language .
And so basically they &apos;re learning by doing .
But at all times , you &apos;re learning by doing .
People really can learn a language with it .
So people really do learn a language .
So people really do learn a language .
So let me show you one example .
This is a sentence that was translated from German into English .
The top is the German .
You can see , it &apos;s pretty much perfect .
Remember , this is 50 million dollars-worth of value .
That &apos;s the current business model .
So it &apos;s extremely unfair towards the poor .
This is totally biased towards the rich .
So this is how we could monetize this .
So here &apos;s the site . Thank you .
So here &apos;s the site .
We haven &apos;t yet launched this Duolingo .
So thank you .
Denise Herzing : Could we speak the language of dolphins ?
Well , we know a few things .
Cognitively , they can understand artificially-created languages .
And they pass self-awareness tests in mirrors .
And most of our work &apos;s pretty non-invasive .
Now the mother you see here is Mugsy .
Now , dolphins are natural acousticians .
But they have other communication signals they use .
They have taste , not smell .
And they have touch .
So dolphins can buzz and tickle each other at a distance .
Another well studied sound are echolocation clicks .
This is the dolphin &apos;s sonar .
And they use these clicks to hunt and feed .
You know , I &apos;ve been buzzed in the water .
Don &apos;t tell anyone . It &apos;s a secret .
Now this is some video of a typical dolphin fight .
There &apos;s a bubble .
For example , they babysit each other &apos;s calves .
I wish I was that coordinated .
But burst-pulsed sounds is a bit of a mystery .
Now , these are three spectragrams .
Two are human words , and one is a dolphin vocalizing .
Now in this footage , the adult is Caroh .
She &apos;s kind of teasing him and taunting him .
He really wants that sargassum .
They &apos;ve got better things to do in the wild .
And these are artificially created whistles .
And the dolphins could get in on the game .
Now this is video of a session .
You have to keep their attention .
Let &apos;s see if they might actually understand what that means .
That &apos;s the rope whistle .
So this is only once .
Okay , so here &apos;s a second toy in the water .
And I &apos;m trying to lead her back to the keyboard .
So I try to give her the scarf .
Whoop . Almost lost it .
But this is the moment where everything becomes possible .
The dolphin &apos;s at the keyboard .
You &apos;ve got full attention .
And this sometimes went on for hours .
Now , how far can this kind of communication go ?
It &apos;s designed to really be two-way .
Now , will they learn to mimic the whistles functionally ?
We hope so and we think so .
Thank you .
Thomas Heatherwick : Building the Seed Cathedral
Hello , my name is Thomas Heatherwick .
And this influenced me .
The first building I built was 20 years ago .
This is a hospital building .
This is a shop for a bag company .
This is studios for artists .
And this is a window display .
And this is a temple in Japan for a Buddhist monk .
And this is a cafe by the sea in Britain .
But they aren &apos;t in London .
And so you &apos;re stuck on a bus .
So it &apos;s got hybrid drive .
I was going to show four main projects .
And this is a project for a bridge .
I think we all kind of stand and watch .
And so this is in Paddington in London .
It &apos;s just steel and timber .
So that &apos;s it speeded up .
It was voted the worst place in Britain to live .
So it felt this has a social dimension .
It has a symbolic importance .
Because just that soil could make the acoustic difference .
And it &apos;s a power park .
So we won the competition to build the U.K. pavilion .
And an expo is a totally bonkers thing .
There &apos;s 250 pavilions .
So there are up to a million people there everyday .
And 250 countries all competing .
So we suddenly realized that there was this thing .
And the same with flowers .
But this phenomenal project &apos;s been happening .
But how could we show these teeny-weeny things ?
And the film &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; actually really helped us .
Thomas Heatherwick : Okay , you get the idea .
So the whole thing can gently move when the wind blows .
And to make the project affordable , we focused our energy .
And so the rest of the site was a public space .
There &apos;s just silence and a cool temperature .
A key thing was how people would interact .
And I just wanted to show you .
And there was a lot of terror .
But there was an underlying support .
Children : One , two , three , go .
TH : I &apos;m sorry about my stupid voice there .
So finally , texture is something .
So we &apos;re building these buildings .
They &apos;re actually identical , so it &apos;s quite cost-effective .
They &apos;re just chopped at different heights .
And that &apos;s my final slide .
Thank you .
Thank you .
So there were 66,000 of these .
This optic was 22 feet long .
Waterproofing the building was a bit crazy .
Thank you , Thomas .
Juan Enriquez : Your online life , permanent as a tattoo
Right ?
A few , but not most .
And electronic tattoos also shout .
Here &apos;s what happened to this company .
So what if Andy was wrong ?
Here &apos;s Andy &apos;s theory .
Why the Greeks ?
So lesson number one : Sisyphus .
It &apos;s a little like your reputation .
Lesson number three : Atalanta .
Greatest runner . She would challenge anybody .
If you won , she would marry you .
If you lost , you died .
How did Hippomenes beat her ?
She kept getting distracted . He eventually won the race .
And then , of course , there &apos;s Narcissus .
Nobody here would ever be accused or be familiar with Narcissus .
Thank you .
How web video powers global innovation
I mean , it &apos;s quite brutal .
And I &apos;m also a little nervous about this .
There are nine billion humans coming our way .
So , let &apos;s explore .
This kid is known online as Lil Demon .
How did he learn them ?
Here &apos;s a clue .
This is what he said at TED in February .
It felt like a revolution .
It was resulting in incredible new talks like these two .
What is going on here ?
You turn up the dials , the wheel starts to turn .
The bigger the crowd , the more potential innovators there are .
They &apos;re creating the ecosystem from which innovation emerges .
The second thing you need is light .
And third , you need desire .
You know , innovation &apos;s hard work .
Absent desire , not going to happen .
Best dancer walks tall , gets the best date .
There &apos;s probably going to be some innovation happening here .
The dance community is now global .
There &apos;s millions connected .
That &apos;s a lot of light .
But the desire element is really dialed way up .
You get hundreds of strangers writing excitedly about you .
Also , the system is self-fueling .
The dark side of the web is allergic to the light .
But you can publish your stuff online .
We are learning from them .
We &apos;re getting great talks back from them .
The wheel is turning .
Okay , step back a minute .
Even he said that , and he would know .
We &apos;re a social species .
We spark off each other .
Suddenly , here we are .
Humanity watches 80 million hours of YouTube every day .
I don &apos;t think it will be .
Video is high-bandwidth for a reason .
Here , let me introduce you to Sam Haber .
He &apos;s a unicyclist .
Suddenly , he starts to emulate and then to innovate .
There &apos;s a problem with a traditional scientific paper .
But look at this video .
Why do people like watching TEDTalks ?
All those ideas are already out there in print .
It &apos;s actually faster to read than to view .
Why would someone bother ?
And in that non-verbal portion , there &apos;s some serious magic .
Reading and writing are actually relatively recent inventions .
Face-to-face communication has been fine-tuned by millions of years of evolution .
It &apos;s probably driven our culture for millennia .
It &apos;s right here .
Print scaled .
that just went global .
Now , this is big .
We may have to reinvent an ancient art form .
Now , TED is just a small part of this .
TEDTalks can &apos;t be a one-way process , one-to-many .
Our future is many-to-many .
Why not a self-fueling cycle in which we all can participate ?
It &apos;s the participation age , right ?
Schools can &apos;t be silos .
We can &apos;t stop learning at age 21 .
What if , in the coming crowd of nine billion ...
That changes everything , right ?
But the good news is they are out there .
Who &apos;s the teacher ?
You &apos;re the teacher .
It &apos;s not crazy ; it &apos;s actually happening right now .
Christopher Makau : Hi . My name is Christopher Makau .
I &apos;m one of the organizers of TEDxKibera .
There &apos;s a self-help group .
They turned a trash place into a garden .
They used the same trash to form green manure .
The same trash site is feeding more than 30 families .
We have our own film school .
Change happens when we see things in a different way .
Today , I see Kibera in a different way .
You know what ?
I bet Chris has always been an inspiring guy .
Guys , we &apos;ve learned from you today .
Thank you .
And thank you .
Aimee Mullins : My 12 pairs of legs
But , of course , that &apos;s the point .
And immediately a voice shouted , &quot; Kangaroo ! &quot;
&quot; No . It should be Go Go Gadget ! &quot;
Somebody that might even be super-abled .
Interesting .
And also these very life-like , intrinsically painted silicone legs .
This started an incredible journey .
You don &apos;t look disabled . &quot;
What does a beautiful woman have to look like ?
What is a sexy body ?
Nobody calls her disabled .
Nobody knew -- everyone thought they were wooden boots .
Poetry matters .
I learned this firsthand with my next adventure .
Heavy !
That &apos;s a good close-up of that one .
So whimsy matters .
Today , I &apos;m 6 &apos; 1 &quot; .
And I was having fun with it .
And the incredible thing was she really meant it .
It is no longer a conversation about overcoming deficiency .
It &apos;s a conversation about augmentation .
It &apos;s a conversation about potential .
Thank you .
Anna Deavere Smith : Four American characters
You see , we also have the technology .
I say , less and less the human touch .
Now we have humans imitating robots .
Concourse Two : Dallas , Fort Worth . Same voice .
And so suddenly they &apos;re looking at me .
I mean , Huck , of course , was tremendous .
So the human touch , you see , it &apos;s disappearing .
And that &apos;s Studs Terkel .
So this piece is about a negative imagination .
And I got this in the Maryland Correctional Institute for Women .
Everything I do is word for word off a tape .
And this is an inmate named Paulette Jenkins .
I want everybody to think we were a normal family .
I &apos;m just talking about the particular night that she died .
And it didn &apos;t work , didn &apos;t work .
I didn &apos;t even go and see what was happening .
I just sat there and listened .
And then he put her in the hallway .
And then he told her , get up .
Her face was bruised . She had a black eye .
&quot; The next morning she was dead .
My own child , I let that happen to . &quot;
So that &apos;s an investigation of the negative imagination .
Everybody thought the four cops would go to jail .
They did not , so there were riots .
Explosion of joy that this verdict had come back this way .
And this is called , &quot; Swallowing the Bitterness . &quot;
&quot; I used to believe America was the best .
I watched in Korea many luxurious Hollywood lifestyle movie .
I never saw any poor man , any black .
Why ? Why do we have to be left out ?
And we are high taxpayer . Where do I find justice ?
&quot; OK . OK ? OK . OK .
Many African-Americans probably think that they won by the trial .
They got their rights by destroying innocent Korean merchants .
&quot; But what about 1992 ? They destroyed innocent people .
They became so hilarious , but I was happy for them .
I wish that I could live together with black people .
But after the riot , it &apos;s too much difference .
Igniting , igniting , igniting fire . Igniting fire .
It &apos;s still there ; it can burst out anytime . &quot;
Mrs. Young-Soon Han .
And this is called &quot; Toughness . &quot;
I think that &apos;s good luck .
&quot; And , I mean , funny things like this happen .
She said , &apos; Look who she is .
&quot; Freedom ? It would have to be the rodeo .
Thank you .
Aaron Koblin : Visualizing ourselves ... with crowd-sourced data
So I think data can actually make us more human .
And I believe this is going to prove true .
This is a project called Flight Patterns .
Everybody &apos;s moving from the East coast to the West coast .
You can also toggle between altitude for model and manufacturer .
See again , the diversity .
This is scrolling up the East coast .
This is looking at ascending versus descending flights .
And you can see , eventually the airport actually flips directions .
This is visualizing international communications .
So it &apos;s how New York communicates with other international cities .
And then you can see people celebrating the next day .
So now on to something completely different .
Some of you may recognize this .
This is Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen &apos;s mechanical chess playing machine .
I can tap into thousands of people &apos;s minds . &quot;
I was probably being a little extreme .
So I created this drawing tool .
I asked people to draw a sheep facing to the left .
And I started collecting sheep .
And I collected a lot , a lot of different sheep .
Lots of sheep .
Kind of amazing what some people did .
So here &apos;s a few statistics from the project .
But only one of them out of the 7,599 said this .
Which I was pretty surprised by .
And I think it &apos;s a pretty valid question .
And there &apos;s a lot of reasons why I chose sheep .
Obviously , we think of sheep as followers .
He draws sheep after sheep .
The narrator &apos;s only appeased when he draws a box .
It &apos;s about your own interpretation and doing something different . &quot;
And I like that .
We asked people to draw what it was that they saw .
But here there was no sheep-like criteria .
This is again showing all the different contributions .
And other people would draw stick figures or smiley faces .
That &apos;s all I &apos;m getting paid for this ?
This is a collaboration with my friend Daniel Massey .
You may recognize these two guys .
So we resynthesized this song .
This is what that sounded like .
You &apos;d be fed a simple audio clip .
I &apos;m sorry for this .
And I was writing software to visualize laser scanners .
So basically motion through 3D space .
So we did exactly that .
And people were making some amazing things .
A whole YouTube channel of people submitting really interesting content .
And I met a music video director named Chris Milk .
As you know , an animation is a series of images .
One is the beginning of the music video .
Collaborator : I felt really sad when he died .
You &apos;re hearing a person &apos;s life .
And you can also see the way that it was drawn .
Again , you can get the playback and personal contribution .
But there &apos;s a bunch of different styles .
And you can sort the video a number of different ways .
And this is called &quot; The Wilderness Downtown . &quot;
It &apos;s an online music video for the Arcade Fire .
Thanks a lot .
Donald Sadoway : The missing link to renewable energy
But coal plants , nuclear plants can &apos;t respond fast enough .
A giant battery could .
You see , the battery is the key enabling device here .
And that changes everything .
Today I want to tell you about such a device .
It &apos;s called the liquid metal battery .
Now let &apos;s get started .
The science is that simple .
Admittedly , I &apos;ve left out a few details .
We need to think about the problem differently .
We need to think big , we need to think cheap .
This battery needs to be made out of earth-abundant elements .
I &apos;m talking about the production of aluminum .
Volta &apos;s battery works at room temperature .
That &apos;s the economic miracle of modern electrometallurgy .
And I did .
I &apos;ll show you how .
So now , how to choose the metals ?
And that includes our own bodies .
Magnesium for the top layer .
And antimony for the bottom layer .
It could be something like a wind farm .
And then we reverse the current .
It &apos;s pretty cool , at least in theory .
But does it really work ?
So what to do next ?
We go to the laboratory .
Now do I hire seasoned professionals ?
So this is the evolution of the liquid metal battery .
We start here with our workhorse one watt-hour cell .
I called it the shotglass .
Along the way we scaled up to the 20 watt-hour cell .
I call it the hockey puck .
And we got the same remarkable results .
And then it was onto the saucer .
That &apos;s 200 watt-hours .
The technology was proving itself to be robust and scalable .
But the pace wasn &apos;t fast enough for us .
We call that the pizza .
It &apos;s going to be 36 inches in diameter .
So what have we learned from all this ?
So what have we learned from all this ?
They lie beyond the visible .
Avoid thermal runaway .
Scaling : Conventional wisdom says reduce cost by producing many .
Malcolm Gladwell : Choice , happiness and spaghetti sauce
And by profession , he &apos;s a psychophysicist .
Which should tell you something about that relationship .
As far as I know , psychophysics is about measuring things .
And Howard is very interested in measuring things .
In fact , the data doesn &apos;t make any sense .
It &apos;s a mess . It &apos;s all over the place .
Howard is not so easily placated .
Howard is a man of a certain degree of intellectual standards .
This was an enormous revelation .
You should be looking for the perfect Pepsis . &quot;
This was his horseradish . He was obsessed with it !
And that &apos;s where we got zesty pickles .
That &apos;s called &quot; adherence . &quot;
So he said , this is what I want to do .
And then he analyzed the data .
Howard doesn &apos;t believe that there is such a thing .
Let &apos;s see if they congregate around certain ideas .
Now why is that important ?
People don &apos;t know what they want ! Right ?
It &apos;s a mystery !
What do you like ? Dark , rich , hearty roast !
Most of you like milky , weak coffee .
So that &apos;s number one thing that Howard did .
Grey Poupon came along , with a Dijon . Right ?
Takes over the mustard business !
A better mustard ! A more expensive mustard !
A mustard of more sophistication and culture and meaning .
And Howard looked to that and said , that &apos;s wrong !
Mustard does not exist on a hierarchy .
There is no good mustard or bad mustard .
There is no perfect mustard or imperfect mustard .
He fundamentally democratized the way we think about taste .
What do I mean by that ?
This is the way it ought to be .
Now that same idea fueled the commercial food industry as well .
And where did that come from ? It came from Italy .
The culture of tomato sauce was thin .
And that &apos;s what would please the maximum number of people .
They were looking for one way to treat all of us .
But that changed , right ?
I guess my cancer different from your cancer .
Genetics has opened the door to the study of human variability .
And the example he used was coffee .
Thank you .
Joel Selanikio : The surprising seeds of a big-data revolution in healthcare
The guys says he &apos;s looking for his keys .
And this is about a 5,000-year-old technology .
Some of you may have used it before .
Do you have any children ? Were your children vaccinated ? &quot;
We have paper forms for vaccination surveys .
We have paper forms to track people who come into clinics .
And millions of children die of these diseases every year .
Now try and wrap your head around that for a second .
You just had teams of hundreds of people .
They went out into the field to answer a particular question .
The process just stops . Happens all the time .
Now 1995 , obviously that was quite a long time ago .
It was a Palm Pilot .
So that &apos;s actually what I began to do .
And it actually worked great .
It worked exactly as well as anybody would have predicted .
There are schools that need to track attendance .
So what do I mean by that ?
That means you had to know I existed .
So these guys are distributing technology .
I need to think about this some more .
They don &apos;t require any programmers .
And that &apos;s exactly what we did .
No one has to speak to me .
And it doesn &apos;t have to be a smartphone .
But there are some additional benefits as well .
Unbelievable improvements in efficiency .
Cloud-based , no training , no consultants , no me .
What happened after we did this ?
And I think it should be obvious .
Thank you .
Rory Sutherland : Sweat the small stuff
So there seems to be a complete disconnect here .
Let me give you one example of this .
It may still be , for all I know .
Has anybody stayed there ?
It actually says garage , funk , rhythm and blues .
Now , these are trivial marketing examples , I accept .
It &apos;s a tiny , tiny thing .
But everything about institutions makes them uncomfortable with that disproportionality .
I tried this exercise recently , talking about banking .
They said , &quot; Can we do an advertising campaign ?
What can we do and encourage more online banking ? &quot;
I said , &quot; It &apos;s really , really easy . &quot;
Why would you willingly expose yourself to bad news ?
Okay , you simply wouldn &apos;t .
And yet , it never happens .
That &apos;s the world people actually want .
And I &apos;d be wrong to dis that completely .
Moving over , we come , of course , to consultancy .
I mean , Tiger surely was actually obeying the Accenture model .
That &apos;s called trivia .
But there &apos;s a fourth thing .
We don &apos;t know what to call it .
Thank you very much .
Kristen Ashburn : The face of AIDS in Africa
For instance , this is Herbert with his grandmother .
This is Joyce who &apos;s -- in this picture -- 21 .
Single mother , HIV positive .
So a few of the stories .
All these pictures are from Zimbabwe .
Kirsten Ashburn : Mmm , gosh .
It was just frightening .
That &apos;s an amazing story , thank you .
KB : Thanks for letting me show these .
Alessandro Acquisti : What will a future without secrets look like ?
You know the incident .
They freak out .
And the rest is history .
Nowadays , Adam and Eve would probably act differently .
And my story is about these tradeoffs .
Do you see the subject ?
But a few years back , we did something else .
Do you see where I &apos;m going with this ?
Of course , the accuracy keeps getting worse .
And should we care ?
Or in a parallel universe , you find this information .
Discrimination was happening through social media for equally skilled candidates .
But think again . Why should that be always the case ?
And in principle , that &apos;s a very good thing .
It &apos;s necessary , but it is not sufficient .
Transparency can be misdirected .
It makes sense , right ?
But then we added the misdirection .
Ten minutes ?
Five minutes ?
One minute ?
How about 15 seconds ?
We can browse the Internet anonymously .
We can have even privacy-preserving data mining .
Which brings me back to the Garden of Eden .
In the garden , Adam and Eve are materially content .
They &apos;re happy . They are satisfied .
However , they also lack knowledge and self-awareness .
They become aware . They achieve autonomy .
The price to pay , however , is leaving the garden .
We get free content .
We get to play Angry Birds . We get targeted apps .
Thank you .
May El-Khalil : Making peace is a marathon
I know what I have just said is simply not obvious .
I used to be a marathon runner .
So we had to start from scratch .
It was honesty and transparency that brought us together .
The marathon grew .
So did our political problems .
But we did have a marathon .
Government protesters became sideline cheerleaders .
They even hosted juice stations .
It gained credibility from both the Lebanese and the international community .
BMA has expanded .
Thank you .
The culture of giving and doing good has become contagious .
Stereotypes have been broken .
Change-makers and future leaders have been created .
I believe these are the building blocks for future peace .
From Boston to Beirut , we stand as one .
After all , peacemaking is not a sprint .
It is more of a marathon .
Thank you .
Sheryl WuDunn : Our century &apos;s greatest injustice
It , however , is enormous in both scale and importance .
So , let &apos;s start off in China .
This photo was taken two weeks ago .
But this is Tiananmen Square .
Let me take you to the real China .
And they share this great splendor with a very large pig .
Why would we waste this money on you ? &quot;
This is what happens to girls in remote areas .
We wrote about her in The New York Times .
He was delighted .
He thought , &quot; Oh , I can renovate the school .
So Dai Manju basically finished out middle school .
She went to high school .
She went to vocational school for accounting .
She scouted for jobs down in Guangdong province in the south .
She sent money back to her family .
What we saw was a natural experiment .
The village became a real standout .
In the 19th century , it was slavery .
In the 20th century , it was totalitarianism .
She &apos;s exaggerating . &quot;
Well , let me ask you this question .
Hands up , please .
Okay , most of you .
Well , you know this latter group , you &apos;re wrong .
And , you know , it happens for several reasons .
Sometimes it &apos;s also because of the sonogram .
The entire center was filled with girls like her .
Poverty , for instance .
There are three reasons why this is the case .
The second reason is it has to do with spending .
alcohol , tobacco , sugary drinks -- and prostitution and festivals .
You need to use scarce resources .
He was speaking to an audience much like yourselves .
However , two-thirds of the way there was a barrier .
Do you think we &apos;ll make it ? &quot;
So here is Bill of Arabia .
So what would some of the specific challenges look like ?
And I &apos;ll just say two things about this .
The second item on the agenda is maternal mortality .
And the most devastating injury is obstetric fistula .
Let me tell you about Mahabuba .
She lives in Ethiopia .
She was married against her will at age 13 .
The baby died , and she ended up with a fistula .
In a word , she stank .
That night , there was a stick in the hut .
She fought off the hyenas with that stick .
She has become part of the solution , not the problem .
I &apos;ve hinted at them : education and also economic opportunity .
With economic opportunity , it can be transformative .
Let me tell you about Saima .
She lives in a small village outside Lahore , Pakistan .
And at the time , she was miserable .
Saima &apos;s not going to produce you a son . &quot;
This is when she had her second daughter .
Saima took that money , and she started an embroidery business .
So now they &apos;re in it together .
Which brings me to the final element , which is education .
Let me tell you about Beatrice Biira .
Heifer sent two goats to Africa .
The twins started producing milk .
They sold the milk for cash .
No matter , she was just delighted to be in school .
She rocketed to the top of her class .
Two years ago , she graduated from Connecticut College .
And that goat was $ 120 .
So you see how transformative little bits of help can be .
But I want to give you a reality check .
There &apos;s Bill Easterly &apos;s book .
There &apos;s a book called &quot; Dead Aid . &quot;
He sort of mumbled .
Turns out that it &apos;s a failed irrigation project .
A few yards away was a failed chicken coop .
You learn from your mistakes , and you continuously improve .
You &apos;re probably asking that . Why should you care ?
I will just leave you with two things .
And that is the story of an aid worker in Darfur .
She never broke down .
What that was was a bird feeder .
And she realized that with that great fortune comes great responsibility .
So , here &apos;s the cause .
Join the movement .
Feel happier and help save the world .
Thank you very much .
Francis Collins : We need better drugs -- now
So let me ask for a show of hands .
How many people here are over the age of 48 ?
Well , there do seem to be a few .
But look what happened in the course of that century .
There &apos;s that dip there for the 1918 flu .
Now , that &apos;s the good news .
But there &apos;s still a lot of work to do .
Only about 250 .
So we have this huge challenge , this huge gap .
Unfortunately , it &apos;s not .
There are no shiny bridges .
You sort of place your bets .
Well , what does this really look like ?
Well , what is it to make a therapeutic , anyway ?
Is it going to land where it &apos;s supposed to ?
How can we make this go faster ?
How can we make it more successful ?
But it &apos;s taken a long time to get there .
That picture you see there ?
Here it is . That &apos;s the same kid .
That &apos;s the good news .
How do we go faster ?
Well , that &apos;s exciting .
I want to tell you about another disorder .
This one is a disorder which is quite rare .
Sam , please have a seat .
Sam Burns : Well , progeria limits me in some ways .
Please join me in thanking and welcoming Sam .
This is a drug that was developed for cancer .
That could be a phenomenal , valuable activity .
And you could expect quite a lot to come from this .
It was developed for cancer . It was AZT .
So how do we actually make that a more generalizable effort ?
Let me tell you another thing we could do .
Suppose we could do this instead on human cells .
Here you see a picture of a lung on a chip .
You can see this chip even breathes .
It has an air channel . It has a blood channel .
Are those cells happy or not ?
So let me sum up .
We are in a remarkable moment here .
This is research that &apos;s high-risk , sometimes high-cost .
And third , and maybe most important , we need talent .
I hope that &apos;s your goal .
It matters for now . It matters as soon as possible .
If you don &apos;t believe me , just ask Sam .
Thank you all very much .
Lucy McRae : How can technology transform the human body ?
I call myself a body architect .
I started my own experiments .
These are Q-tips stuck to my roommate with wig glue .
We were creating visual imagery provoking human evolution .
Or the way that we attract sexual partners ?
It &apos;s perfume coming from the inside out .
And I feel like I &apos;ve just got started .
So here &apos;s to another day at the office .
Thank you !
Thank you !
Sally Kohn : Let &apos;s try emotional correctness
So when I do my job , people hate me .
I am a progressive lesbian talking head on Fox News .
I am a gay talking head on Fox News .
So I go on television .
It &apos;s totally almost just like that .
And that &apos;s just on air .
The hate mail I get is unbelievable .
Let me give you a small example .
I care about two things .
One , I care that you spell it right .
Just quick refresher , it &apos;s D-Y-K-E .
You &apos;d totally be surprised .
Are you being friendly ? Are you just being naive ?
Or do you really want to hurt me personally ?
Political persuasion begins with being emotionally correct .
Now here &apos;s the kicker .
Conservatives are really nice .
That is emotional correctness .
I &apos;m not saying it &apos;s easy .
Now this guy doesn &apos;t agree with me , yet .
Thank you .
Seth Godin : The tribes we lead
So sometimes I get invited to give weird talks .
Unfortunately I couldn &apos;t go .
Sometimes they get in trouble , but not often .
They make balloon animals .
But what do we do for a living ?
What exactly to the people watching this do every day ?
We try to make big , permanent , important change .
But we don &apos;t think about it that way .
And I &apos;ve been studying it for a couple years .
And I want to share a couple stories with you today .
First , about a guy named Nathan Winograd .
Nathan was the number two person at the San Francisco SPCA .
And everyone said it was impossible .
They persisted . And Nathan went directly to the community .
And then he went to North Carolina and did it again .
And he went to Reno and he did it again .
It is a moment in time .
Henry Ford comes up with a really cool idea .
Because he &apos;s got an efficient enough factory .
You can change the fabric of an entire country .
Ever-cheaper labor and ever-faster machines .
Take a good idea and push it on the world .
I have a better mousetrap .
And you can build an entire industry on that .
If necessary you can put babies in your ads .
If necessary you can use babies to sell other stuff .
And if babies don &apos;t work , you can use doctors .
But be careful .
I call it the idea of tribes .
It &apos;s about leading and connecting people and ideas .
And it &apos;s something that people have wanted forever .
The Internet was supposed to homogenize everyone by connecting us all .
Instead what it &apos;s allowed is silos of interest .
So you &apos;ve got the red-hat ladies over here .
You &apos;ve got the red-hat triathletes over there .
You &apos;ve got the organized armies over here .
You &apos;ve got the disorganized rebels over here .
You &apos;ve got people in white hats making food .
And people in white hats sailing boats .
Now it turns out this is a legitimate non-photoshopped photo .
But they always stop and take a picture .
You know the pirate tribe is a fascinating one .
He did it by creating a movement .
You don &apos;t need everyone .
What it &apos;s about instead is finding the true believers .
You know , this is one of my favorite devices .
But let me just try a couple .
The Beatles did not invent teenagers .
They merely decided to lead them .
She didn &apos;t invent the idea of caring about this issue .
Bob Marley did not invent Rastafarians .
He just stepped up and said , &quot; Follow me . &quot;
Someone stands up and says , &quot; This one is important .
We need to organize around it . &quot;
And not everyone will . But you don &apos;t need everyone .
So Tony Hsieh does not run a shoe store .
Zappos isn &apos;t a shoe store .
It &apos;s exactly the same behavior though .
We &apos;re just waiting for someone to lead us . &quot;
Michelle Kaufman has pioneered new ways of thinking about environmental architecture .
By leading a movement and making change .
And around and around and around it goes .
So three questions I &apos;d offer you .
The first one is , who exactly are you upsetting ?
The second question is , who are you connecting ?
And the third one is , who are you leading ?
It &apos;s a story of a product that tells a story .
It &apos;s tens of thousands of pairs of shoes .
And the people he surrounds himself with need the connection .
They need the leadership . It makes a difference .
You don &apos;t need permission from people to lead them .
They challenge what &apos;s currently there .
The second thing is , they build a culture .
They connect people to one another .
Do you know what people want more than anything ?
They want to be missed .
They want to be missed when they &apos;re gone .
And tribe leaders can do that .
Being a leader gives you charisma .
Finally , they commit .
They commit to the cause . They commit to the tribe .
They commit to the people who are there .
So I &apos;d like you to do something for me .
Thank you very much . I appreciate it .
Lee Hotz : Inside an Antarctic time machine
Nowhere on Earth offers us such a perfect record .
It &apos;s urgent work . We know that temperatures are rising .
This past May was the warmest worldwide on record .
And we know that levels of greenhouse gases are rising too .
They have to dig themselves out every day .
It makes for an exotic and chilly commute .
It &apos;s really a time machine .
Yes , I said that with a Q , quadrillion .
Each cylinder is a parfait of time .
From this , we can detect an extraordinary number of things .
Most importantly , these cylinders and this snow trap air .
And this is the object of their scrutiny .
Why do we need to study this anymore ?
Don &apos;t we already know how they affect temperatures ?
Indeed , we run the risk of making things worse .
This process requires extraordinary precautions .
The scientists must insure that the ice is not contaminated .
Imagine juggling a snowball across the tropics .
They work against the clock and against the thermometer .
Here , the ice seems a living presence .
The wind that rubs against it gives it voice .
It is a voice of experience .
It is a voice we should heed .
Thank you .
Bill Ford : A future beyond traffic gridlock
I literally grew up with the Ford Motor Company .
So my parents would go to dinner .
And it was snowing that day .
My dad finished dinner early that evening .
So it kind of cooled my test-driving for a little while .
But I really began to love cars then .
And my first car was a 1975 electric-green Mustang .
Because he believed that with mobility comes freedom and progress .
And that &apos;s a belief that I share .
My other great passion is the environment .
And that was true until I got to college .
And I really discovered that my professors weren &apos;t completely wrong .
I had some very interesting conversations , as you can imagine .
I was considered a radical .
We &apos;re pushing fuel efficiency to new heights .
We &apos;re starting to sell electric cars , which is great .
Today there are about 800 million cars on the road worldwide .
Today the average driver in Beijing has a five-hour commute .
Well I think you probably already have the picture .
And our quality of life is going to be severely compromised .
So what &apos;s going to solve this ?
These are all really good ideas that will move us forward .
But the potential of a connected car network is almost limitless .
You know , we &apos;ve come a long way .
We don &apos;t want to regress and lose that freedom .
This is a big one , and it won &apos;t wait .
So let &apos;s get started now .
Thank you .
John Hardy : My green school dream
I had a really hard time in school .
I ran away .
It was a fairy tale , and then we retired .
It has an intact Hindu culture .
Cynthia and I were there .
We decided to give back locally .
And here it is : it &apos;s called the Green School .
The classrooms have no walls .
The teacher is writing on a bamboo blackboard .
The desks are not square .
And we practice holism .
Our children spend 181 days going to school in a box .
Would he have had more possibilities in his life ?
The classrooms have natural light .
They &apos;re beautiful . They &apos;re bamboo .
The breeze passes through them .
So we basically turned the box into a bubble .
But since that happened , they own those desks .
They know they can control their world .
And you know what these are .
There &apos;s nowhere to flush .
How many people times how much water .
There isn &apos;t enough water .
And they work . People use them . People are okay .
It &apos;s something you should think about doing .
Not many things didn &apos;t work .
We had to replace them with recyclable plastic .
The teachers dragged giant PVC whiteboards into the classrooms .
I said , &quot; Welcome to Green School . &quot;
I asked him , &quot; Why ? &quot;
In August I &apos;m bringing my sons . &quot;
This was a great thing .
It &apos;s becoming a community .
It &apos;s becoming a green model .
We had to look at everything .
No petrochemicals in the pavement .
No pavement .
These are volcanic stones laid by hand .
There are no sidewalks .
This is the school buffalo .
He &apos;s planning to eat that fence for dinner .
All the fences at Green School are green .
Landscaping .
We dropped them gently in .
This young man is picking organic vegetables .
The food is incredible .
Green School is a place of pioneers , local and global .
And it &apos;s a kind of microcosm of the globalized world .
The kids are from 25 countries .
Green School is going into its third year with 160 children .
But you also learn other things .
You learn bamboo building .
You practice ancient Balinese arts .
This is called mud wrestling in the rice fields .
The kids love it .
The mothers aren &apos;t quite convinced .
And we were right .
A woman came from Africa with music .
We need someone to come and study it .
And all the kids are thriving .
And how did we do all this ?
On giant grass .
It &apos;s bamboo .
It comes out of the ground like a train .
The yellow box was called the administration complex .
It &apos;s a double helix .
It has administrators in it and many , many other things .
So we built big models .
We had them engineered by the engineers .
It was chaos .
The heart of school has seven kilometers of bamboo in it .
Is this doable in your community ?
We believe it is .
Green School is a model we built for the world .
It &apos;s a model we built for Bali .
So , Mr. Gore , thank you .
Thank you .
Guy-Philippe Goldstein : How cyberattacks threaten real-world peace
Good afternoon .
regarding cyberattacks against the American company Google .
Many things have been said about this .
It so happens that these weapons are dangerous .
These virtual weapons can also destroy the physical world .
As a result , the Americans take the threat very seriously .
which was indeed the case in Europe between 1650 and 1750 .
Okay , but what distinguishes it from an offensive unit ?
But today both countries say the best defense is to attack .
This issue isn &apos;t just theoretical .
Estonia accused Russia .
And these preemptive attacks might not just remain in cyberspace .
Thank you .
Toby Shapshak : You don &apos;t need an app for that
Who has an Android phone ?
Who has a Blackberry ?
Who will admit in public to having a Blackberry ?
You don &apos;t have to put your hands up .
These are rhetorical .
And why did Eric Merrifield have to invent the dolos ?
Actually , it isn &apos;t .
What it is is a map of innovation .
All the places with lots of electricity , it isn &apos;t .
So where it &apos;s happening is in Africa .
This is real innovation , and I define it as problem-solving .
People are solving real problems in Africa .
Why ? Because we have to .
Because we have real problems .
Fantastic . Why do you even need a credit card ?
Something like 25 million dollars a day is transacted through M-Pesa .
And you think this is just a feature phone .
Actually it &apos;s the smartphone of Africa .
Why ? Because that &apos;s what we need .
We have really severe energy problems in Africa .
I come from Johannesburg , which is a mining town .
It &apos;s built on gold .
This is a picture I Instagrammed earlier .
Really simple , really effective , really life-saving .
Really simple , using a basic phone .
If you don &apos;t have electricity , no problem !
I believe we are the gold .
This is not that catchy catchphrase .
This is innovation over the edge .
So there &apos;s only one thing left to say .
&#91; &quot; You &apos;re welcome &quot; &#93;
Hans Rosling : The good news of the decade ?
They &apos;re called Millennium Development Goals .
So there &apos;s good news .
I &apos;ll prove them wrong on both points .
Come with me to the wonderful world of statistics .
And I will take Kenya as an example .
Here you see the data .
What is the origin of the data ?
What we rely on is not an incomplete system .
We have interviews , we have surveys .
How many children did you have ?
Are they alive ?
If they died , at what age and what year ?
But they have good quality .
So this is a limitation .
And when the experts in the U.N.
It was so tragic .
I was so happy .
This was the estimate of the new survey .
Isn &apos;t it nice -- isn &apos;t it nice , yeah ?
So we celebrated .
They start &#91; in &#93; 1990 -- they measure to 2009 .
They say , &quot; 0.9 percent , no progress . &quot;
That &apos;s unfair .
They have 2.4 percent .
We have a decent trend .
The HIV epidemic peaked .
We got , later , the mosquito netting .
So is this fair now to measure this over 19 years ?
An economist would never do that .
I have just divided it into two periods .
In the 90s , only 1.2 percent , only 1.2 percent .
And look here when I take you into my bubble graphs .
Still here , child death per 1,000 on that axis .
Here we have &#91; the &#93; year .
But then , in the &apos; 80s , watch out here .
Congo got into civil war , and they leveled off here .
Ghana got very ahead , fast .
That &apos;s where we are today .
So let me show the wider picture .
My country , Sweden : 1800 , we were up there .
It &apos;s very strange . It &apos;s sort of embarrassing .
And then , you see , these were famine years .
My ancestors moved to the United States .
Sweden achieved a low child mortality because we started early .
We had primary school actually started in 1842 .
So we are off track -- that &apos;s what Sweden is .
But you don &apos;t talk about it so much .
Egypt was up here in 1960 , higher than Congo .
And down they went , you know .
And they got safer water , they eradicated malaria .
And isn &apos;t it a success story .
Millennium Development Goal rates for child mortality is fully possible .
Kenya is now speeding up .
Here we have a problem .
The relationship between child mortality and family size .
This is , once again , 1960 -- 50 years ago .
The dark blue here is sub-Saharan Africa .
And the size of the bubble is the population .
And these are the so-called &quot; developing &quot; countries .
And the ones over there , they were so-called Western countries .
They had low child mortality and small families .
What has happened ?
This is what happened . Now I start the world .
And here Brazil is in the Western Box .
Welcome to a decent life .
Come on . We want everyone down there .
This is the vision we have , isn &apos;t it .
There we are today .
Huh ?
They have here Singapore .
They have the lowest child mortality in the world , Singapore .
They have here Qatar .
It &apos;s the richest country in the world with Al Jazeera .
How the heck could they be &#91; a &#93; developing country ?
This is crap .
The rest here is good -- the rest is good .
What is the importance now with the relations here .
It &apos;s very clear that this is what happens .
Let &apos;s be clear about that .
And that is fully possible . Let &apos;s do it .
Thank you very much .
Drew Curtis : How I beat a patent troll
So case closed , right ?
Wrong .
And this can take quite a while .
And they started settling out .
with no employees .
My response : &quot; How about nothing ? ! &quot;
We didn &apos;t have high hopes for that outcome .
But they settled .
No counter offer .
Now how did that happen ?
It came back signed .
Now why ? You can call them .
They &apos;re not under NDA either .
Patents are very difficult to overturn .
Infringement is a lot easier to disprove .
Don &apos;t forget that .
So what does all this mean ?
And what do they do with that money ?
They plow it right back into filing more troll lawsuits .
The health care industry would like stronger protections for inventors .
The hi-tech industry would like stronger protections for producers .
And I thought , &quot; I should patent this . &quot;
Thank you .
Clay Shirky : Why SOPA is a bad idea
I &apos;m going to start here .
And it &apos;s a copyright violation .
So there &apos;s two bills in Congress right now .
One is called SOPA , the other is called PIPA .
SOPA stands for the Stop Online Piracy Act .
It &apos;s from the Senate .
They want to take them out of the domain name system .
But technology moved on , as technology is wont to do .
Because it turned out we &apos;re not really couch potatoes .
We don &apos;t really like to only consume .
That was the level of rhetoric .
And Congress did something .
Taping and remixing and sharing with your friends is okay .
But this taping business , fine , let it go .
But that wasn &apos;t what the media businesses wanted .
They had wanted Congress to outlaw copying full-stop .
So they went for plan B.
It took them a while to formulate plan B.
Bits are copyable . That &apos;s what computers do .
That is a side effect of their ordinary operation .
Some of the stuff we share is stuff we &apos;ve made .
Some of the stuff we share is stuff we &apos;ve found .
So PIPA and SOPA are round two .
So this is the Internet they have in mind .
These industries will not be content with breaking our Internet .
If they break it , they will break it for everybody .
That &apos;s the easy thing .
That &apos;s the simple thing .
And what they want is not to have to do that .
They don &apos;t want legal distinctions between legal and illegal sharing .
They just want the sharing to go away .
That &apos;s the way to handle this .
Because that &apos;s the real message of PIPA and SOPA .
Thank you .
Jonathan Drori : What we think we know
I &apos;d like to begin with four questions .
That &apos;s an in-joke , by the way .
Would you be able to do that ?
And if you can , just scribble a pattern .
I &apos;m not quite sure how he died , actually .
Was he beheaded in the end , or hung ?
But , actually , we don &apos;t do that .
The mass of this comes out of the air .
Now , I passed all my biology exams in Britain .
That &apos;s what plants actually do for a living .
So , why is it hotter in summer than in winter ?
I promise you that most of you will have got that .
Other ones are kind of going like this . All right .
Right ? That would explain it , right ?
And this is NASA &apos;s view . They &apos;re stunningly similar .
I hope you notice the coincidence here .
You &apos;d show them something like this , wouldn &apos;t you ?
It &apos;s a plan , looking down from above .
But , no , look what I found in the textbooks .
And the Exploratorium does that really , really well .
So , children are not empty vessels , OK ?
Poor teaching actually does more harm than good .
I &apos;ve always wanted to say that in this country .
Thank you very much .
Vilayanur Ramachandran : The neurons that shaped civilization
Just think about this problem for a second .
But it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space .
And this is truly the most amazing thing in the world .
We &apos;re looking at neurons here .
There are 100 billion neurons in the adult human brain .
So , how do you go about studying the brain ?
This is what I spoke about in the last TED .
These neurons will fire when a person performs a specific action .
And this is truly astonishing .
Now , what is the significance of these mirror neurons ?
So , this is important for imitation and emulation .
Well , why is that important ?
Well , let &apos;s take a look at the next slide .
Mirror neurons and imitation , emulation .
All of that happened relatively quickly .
So , this made evolution suddenly Lamarckian , instead of Darwinian .
So , it &apos;s empathizing the other person being touched .
So , I call them Gandhi neurons , or empathy neurons .
And this is not in some abstract metaphorical sense .
You &apos;ve dissolved the barrier between you and other human beings .
And this is not mumbo-jumbo philosophy .
It emerges from our understanding of basic neuroscience .
So , here you have my last slide .
Fahad Al-Attiya : A country with no water
Salaam alaikum .
Welcome to Doha .
I am in charge of making this country &apos;s food secure .
So going in , what was Qatar in the 1940s ?
We were about 11,000 people living here .
None of the glamour that you see today existed .
It wasn &apos;t that they couldn &apos;t develop cities .
Resources weren &apos;t there to develop them .
And you can see that life expectancy was also short .
Most people died around the age of 50 .
So let &apos;s move to chapter two : the oil era .
1939 , that &apos;s when they discovered oil .
What did it do ?
Because we lived scattered .
People started to get to know each other .
And we realized that there are some differences in accents .
So that is the chapter two : the oil era .
Let &apos;s look at today .
So what &apos;s the population today ?
It &apos;s 1.7 million people .
That is in less than 60 years .
Lifespan has increased to 78 .
Water consumption has increased to 430 liters .
And this is amongst the highest worldwide .
Cities were totally wiped out because of the lack of water .
This is history being made in this region .
But of course , with the use of technology .
So Brazil has 1,782 millimeters per year of precipitation of rain .
Qatar has 74 , and we have that growth rate .
The question is how .
How could we survive that ?
We have no water whatsoever .
Simply because of this gigantic , mammoth machine called desalination .
Energy is the key factor here . It changed everything .
So that is our lake , if you can see it .
That is our river .
That is how you all happen to use and enjoy water .
So what are the risks ?
Do you worry much ?
There is growing demand , growing population .
We &apos;ve turned seven billion only a few months ago .
And so that number also demands food .
There &apos;s also changing diets .
They start eating more meat and so on and so forth .
We only have two days of water reserve .
So we also face risks .
The question is , is there a solution ?
Is there a sustainable solution ?
Indeed there is .
Let &apos;s start with the water .
A depletable energy ? Fossil fuel ?
Or should we use something else ?
And that is a lot of water .
Without it we can &apos;t do anything .
So that &apos;s what we are planning to do .
Thank you very much .
Bill Clinton : My wish : Rebuilding Rwanda
It is also unstable .
All easier said than done .
And even non-democratic governments are more sensitive to public opinion .
30 percent of our households gave .
Half of them gave over the Internet .
The median contribution was somewhere around 57 dollars .
And thirdly , because of the rise of non-governmental organizations .
There are now a couple of hundred thousand .
He &apos;s over there .
But the price went to 140 dollars from 500 .
And pretty soon , the average price was 192 dollars .
Now we can get it for about 100 dollars .
We negotiated it down to 190 .
We just reorganized the markets .
I think it &apos;s a bird &apos;s nest on the ground .
We need a movie on those six categories .
So we &apos;re trying to do that .
So organizing these markets is one thing we try to do .
But the money is there to reach others .
The systems are not there to reach the people .
Will it provide high quality care ?
And they &apos;ve achieved a lot of other amazing health results .
And so we have set about doing that .
Now , we started working together 18 months ago .
And then we have others working in these other related programs .
So she now works full-time on this for very little pay .
Mortality at birth was over two-and-a-half percent .
That &apos;s lower than the figure in the United States .
That &apos;s about 43 percent of all the pregnancies .
We &apos;re also beginning to do this in Malawi and Lesotho .
We &apos;re doing this in an environmentally responsible way .
It &apos;s worth a try and I believe it would succeed .
Thank you and God bless you .
Chade-Meng Tan : Everyday compassion at Google
So what does the happiest man in the world look like ?
He certainly doesn &apos;t look like me .
He looks like this .
His name is Matthieu Ricard .
And Matthieu &apos;s happiness measure is off the charts .
He &apos;s by far the happiest man ever measured by science .
Perhaps something very naughty .
Actually , he was meditating on compassion .
Matthieu &apos;s brain scan shows that compassion is not a chore .
Compassion is something that creates happiness .
Compassion is fun .
And that mind-blowing insight changes the entire game .
But fun is not enough .
What if compassion is also profitable ?
What if compassion is also good for business ?
That would create the conditions for world peace .
Fortunately , I didn &apos;t have to look very far .
Google is a company born of idealism .
It &apos;s a company that thrives on idealism .
It &apos;s sort of a funny pattern .
And sometimes it gets big enough to become official .
And let me give you some examples .
So what do they do ?
They just go ahead and start a fundraiser .
And expressions of compassion are also found in our international offices .
But again , fun is not enough .
There are also real business benefits .
So what are they ?
What does that mean ?
There are three components of compassion .
So what has this got to do with business leadership ?
And he calls them &quot; Level 5 leaders . &quot;
These are leaders who are highly ambitious for the greater good .
The motivational component of compassion creates ambition for greater good .
And this is the first compelling business benefit .
Employees mutually inspire each other towards greater good .
So this mutual inspiration promotes collaboration , initiative and creativity .
It makes us a highly effective company .
In our experience , there are three ingredients .
Or , how can you further serve the greater good ?
That &apos;s one .
The second ingredient is autonomy .
So in Google , there &apos;s a lot of autonomy .
And he considers himself one of the inmates .
It &apos;s less naughty than it sounds .
What a company .
So &quot; Search Inside Yourself &quot; -- how does it work ?
It works in three steps .
The first step is attention training .
Attention is the basis of all higher cognitive and emotional abilities .
And this creates the foundation for emotion intelligence .
The second step follows the first step .
The second step is developing self-knowledge and self-mastery .
What does that mean ?
What does that mean ? Imagine this .
I want you to be happy . &quot;
Imagine you can do that .
And this also creates the conditions for compassion in the workplace .
If you want to be happy , practice compassion . &quot;
Thank you .
Stephen Lawler : Tour Microsoft &apos;s Virtual Earth
What does this all mean for us ?
But we want to use our brain !
We want to navigate , explore , discover information .
Here is an example of our aerial camera .
This is panchromatic . It &apos;s actually four color cones .
In addition , it &apos;s multi-spectral .
We fly these airplanes at 5,000 feet in the air .
We think a lot of good can come from this technology .
We have to bundle adjust them . Find tie points .
Extract geometry from the images .
This process is a very calculated process .
In fact , it was always done manual .
They &apos;d drive the streets with lasers called LIDAR .
We think about the user interface .
What does it mean to look at it from multiple perspectives ?
The freshness , the capacity . I can turn this image .
I can look at it from multiple viewpoints and angles .
What we &apos;re trying to do is build a virtual world .
I thank you very much for your time .
Allan Jones : A map of the brain
Humans have long held a fascination for the human brain .
So let &apos;s take a look at the brain .
This is the blood vessels .
On the side here , this is temporal cortex .
This is where all your decision-making processes are going on .
But there &apos;s actually a lot of structure there .
It &apos;s cells and it &apos;s wires all wired together .
And that &apos;s shown here in the the very light blue .
You can see areas where neuronal cell bodies are being stained .
So the outer part of that brain is the neocortex .
It &apos;s one continuous processing unit , if you will .
But you can also see things underneath there as well .
They &apos;re probably less cell dense .
So there &apos;s about 86 billion neurons in our brain .
And as you can see , they &apos;re very non-uniformly distributed .
And how they &apos;re distributed really contributes to their underlying function .
So let &apos;s take a deeper look .
Let &apos;s look at neurons .
So as I mentioned , there are 86 billion neurons .
There are also these smaller cells as you &apos;ll see .
These are support cells -- astrocytes glia .
And the nerves themselves are the ones who are receiving input .
They &apos;re storing it , they &apos;re processing it .
And each neuron itself is largely unique .
These are proteins .
They &apos;re proteins that are controlling things like ion channel movement .
They &apos;re controlling who nervous system cells partner up with .
We each have 23 pairs of chromosomes .
We get one from mom , one from dad .
And on these chromosomes are roughly 25,000 genes .
They &apos;re encoded in the DNA .
So we sent our lab technician out .
We were seeking normal human brains .
What we actually start with is a medical examiner &apos;s office .
This a place where the dead are brought in .
We are seeking normal human brains .
This is magnetic resonance imaging -- MRI .
So we collect this MR.
This maps the large cabling in the brain .
And then what we get is our first mapping .
And remember , it &apos;s frozen .
We take a microscope slide .
Then we very carefully melt onto the slide .
So again this is what they can see under the microscope .
And they can make basically what &apos;s a reference atlas .
This is a more detailed map .
So the technician takes the instructions .
They scribe along a place there .
And then the laser actually cuts .
There &apos;s a container underneath that &apos;s collecting that tissue .
We &apos;re taking over a thousand samples for each brain .
This area shown here is an area called the hippocampus .
It &apos;s involved in learning and memory .
And it contributes to about 70 samples of those thousand samples .
We &apos;ve done right now two human brains-worth of data .
So here &apos;s the modalities that we put together .
Here &apos;s the MR. It provides the framework .
And each gene gives us a fingerprint .
So what can scientists learn about this data ?
We &apos;re just starting to look at this data ourselves .
There &apos;s some basic things that you would want to understand .
Two great examples are drugs , Prozac and Wellbutrin .
These are commonly prescribed antidepressants .
Now remember , we &apos;re assaying genes .
Genes send the instructions to make proteins .
Proteins are targets for drugs .
And for the first time , we can actually do that .
So now we can look throughout the brain .
We can see this unique fingerprint .
And we get confirmation .
It &apos;s as interesting a side effect as it could be .
We &apos;re similar at the genetic level .
And those genes are interesting , but they &apos;re very subtle .
Now what do those differences look like ?
These are two genes that we found as good examples .
DISC1 is a gene that &apos;s deleted in schizophrenia .
Those kinds of studies require much larger populations .
I think these resources are incredibly valuable .
They give researchers a handle on where to go .
We &apos;re certainly going to be looking at more .
This is the new frontier , if you will .
Thanks .
Rose George : Inside the secret shipping industry
It chose Somali piracy .
And I thought , would that happen in any other industry ?
Would we see 544 Greyhound bus drivers ?
It wouldn &apos;t happen .
So I started to get intrigued .
That is how fundamentally we still depend on shipping .
But shipping isn &apos;t that .
Shipping is as crucial to us as it has ever been .
Shipping brings us 90 percent of world trade .
Shipping has quadrupled in size since 1970 .
We are more dependent on it now than ever .
&#91; $ 60.2 billion &#93; Now why is this ?
Nothing to see , move along .
And it was a revelation .
Now that &apos;s because shipping is very efficient .
Containerization has made it very efficient .
Ships have automation now .
They can operate with small crews .
They don &apos;t have time to relax .
So that was a normal working ship .
Now how is that possible ?
And that was a surprise to me .
We were no longer allowed on deck .
There were double pirate watches .
What else does our sea blindness mask ?
And shipping is the greenest method of transport .
There are interesting initiatives going on .
But why has it taken so long ?
A humpback can transmit a sound across a whole ocean .
But there are no laws governing acoustic pollution yet .
I &apos;d really loved being on board Kendal .
Thank you .
Charity Tillemann-Dick : Singing after a double lung transplant
Crazy , I know . Insane .
Thank you .
My heart was three-and-a-half sizes too big .
I was very limited by my condition , physically .
This meant making trade-offs .
I come from Colorado .
Well , the altitude exacerbated my symptoms .
Mine was 146 .
If you run out of medicine , you definitely die .
No one wants to go on Flolan .
But when I needed it , it was a godsend .
Within a few days , I could walk again .
Then in February of 2008 , my grandfather passed away .
It certainly didn &apos;t prepare me for what came next .
Seven weeks later , I got a call from my family .
At 24 , my death would have been entirely expected .
I heard my heart &apos;s valves snapping open and closed .
I didn &apos;t .
I wanted to live .
He said , &quot; Be happy .
A happy patient is a healthy patient . &quot;
And it was right-heart failure .
It was my doctor in Cleveland , Marie Budev .
And they had lungs .
It was a match .
They were from Texas .
And everybody was really happy for me , but me .
I fell into this apocalyptic dream world .
They left my chest open for two weeks .
You could see my over-sized heart beating inside of it .
I was on a dozen machines that were keeping me alive .
An infection ravaged my skin .
He said it would kill me .
One year ago to this very day , I woke up .
I was 95 lbs .
It &apos;s about living .
Medical conditions don &apos;t negate the human condition .
And I &apos;m so grateful they did .
And some of us might even sing .
&#91; Singing : French &#93; Thank you .
Thank you .
And I &apos;d like to thank my pianist , Monica Lee .
Thank you so much .
Thank you .
And I say believe because this process is still ongoing .
In case you &apos;re wondering , this is our strength test .
We have already gone far beyond the limits of human endurance .
From the entrance , this is nothing like a commercial cave .
We &apos;re roughly two days from the entrance at that point .
Otherwise it is completely dark in these places .
It &apos;s basically like a tree collecting water coming down .
So descend into Huautla Plateau in Mexico .
Next year I &apos;ll be leading an international team to J2 .
The lead crews will be underground for pushing 30 days straight .
Now I remember that term really well for two reasons .
This is some life-support equipment closed-cycle .
To experience it is a privilege .
Bill Stone : That was taken in Wakulla Springs , Florida .
This is Europa .
Carolyn Porco mentioned another one called Enceladus the other day .
Now we have to get through the ice .
You need a melt probe .
It &apos;s basically a nuclear-heated torpedo .
The ice could be anywhere from three to 16 miles deep .
You need an AUV , an autonomous underwater vehicle .
And as the movie says , this is one smart puppy .
This is part of DEPTHX &apos;s mission .
There are two primary targets we &apos;re doing here .
One is , how do you do science autonomy underground ?
No hands at the wheel .
DEPTHX is an all-seeing eyeball .
What then of manned space exploration ?
There are three underpinnings of working in space privately .
One of them is the requirement for economical earth-to-space transport .
Go , go , go .
The next thing we need are places to stay on orbit .
It &apos;s not going to look like that .
Anybody drink one of these here this week ?
You &apos;d pay 10,000 dollars for that in orbit .
Not even the guys at Tesla can fight that physics .
There is a place where you can .
We can &apos;t do that right now .
We have to beat that .
We can do it because in space there are no aerodynamics .
We can go and use inflatable systems for almost everything .
And we can extend that now to just about everything .
Bob Bigelow currently has a test article in the orbit .
We can go much further .
There &apos;s another thing .
You got two choices .
It has never been done .
That &apos;s not true .
To bust the paradigm a radically different approach is needed .
I intend to lead that expedition .
It can be done in seven years with the right backing .
We have collectively forgotten that lesson .
Thank you .
Allison Hunt : How to get hip
No , you can &apos;t start the three minutes .
Reset the three minutes , that &apos;s just not fair .
AH : Oh my God , it &apos;s harsh up here .
I mean I &apos;m nervous enough as it is .
Five weeks ago I had total hip replacement surgery .
Do you know that surgery ?
But first you need to know two things about me .
Just two things .
Now , in Canada , we have that great healthcare system .
That means we get our new hips for free .
So my hip had been hurting me for years .
I finally went to the doctor , which was free .
And she referred me to an orthopedic surgeon , also free .
That is what free gets you .
18 more months .
I wouldn &apos;t have my new hip for this TED .
I wouldn &apos;t have my new hip for TEDGlobal in Africa .
I would not have my new hip for TED2008 .
Oh yeah .
Can I tell you how un-Canadian that is ?
We do not think that way .
&quot; Great ! Excellent ! &quot;
No , no . Front of the line .
And I saw a sign .
Well , they signed me up immediately .
Yeah . They needed some young blood .
I worked alone .
Every Friday morning I was at the gift shop .
All the staff got to know the plucky , young volunteer .
So , naturally , I had my vest and my identification .
Two reasons .
Derek Sivers : Weird , or just different ?
This is 26th , that &apos;s 27th . &quot;
You say , &quot; Well , blocks don &apos;t have names .
He leaves , a little confused and disappointed .
Blocks have names .
There &apos;s Block 17 , house number one . &quot;
The second house ever built is house number two .
And this map is also accurate .
Domo arigato gozaimashita .
Nina Tandon : Caring for engineered tissue
Good morning everybody .
We plate them into dishes that we sometimes call petri dishes .
Why do I do this ?
What does that even mean ?
Well , the heart beats , rhythmically , tirelessly , faithfully .
What else do we know about the heart ?
Well , heart cells are pretty greedy .
Let &apos;s take the example of electrical stimulation .
It &apos;s about the size of a mini marshmallow .
And after one week , it &apos;s beating .
You can see it in the upper left-hand corner .
It &apos;s amazing that these cells beat at all .
What does this mean for us ?
Let &apos;s do something really simple .
Let &apos;s remind ourselves that cells are not an abstract concept .
May none of your non-cancer cells become endangered species .
Thank you .
Matt Mills : Image recognition that triggers augmented reality
So let me start with this .
Voice : Now simmer blinks on flowery braes ...
There &apos;s nothing done to this image .
So what I have here is a wireless router .
Then connect the power . Finally , the yellow ethernet cable .
Congratulations . You have now completed setup .
MM : Awesome . Thank you .
They &apos;re not very animated .
This was the fourth take , I &apos;m told .
Tamara , would you like to jump in ?
MM : I should leap in .
Teacher : See what happens . Keep going .
TV .
Oh my God .
Teacher : Now move it either side . See what happens .
Move away from it and come back to it .
Oh , that is so cool .
Teacher : And then , have you got it again ?
Oh my God ! How did you do that ?
Second child : It &apos;s magic .
MM : So , it &apos;s not magic .
Tamara , are you recording ?
Okay , so are you all ready ?
One , two , three . Go !
Audience : Whooooooo !
MM : Fellows are really good at that .
We &apos;re all very , very familiar with the Internet .
It &apos;s completely free to download this application .
Oh , there we are . We can save it now .
Tamara Roukaerts : We &apos;re ready to go .
MM on One , two , three . Go !
Paul Gilding : The Earth is full
Here they are : The Earth is full .
What this means is our economy is unsustainable .
What I &apos;m saying is our approach is simply unsustainable .
But that &apos;s not possible , you might think .
We can &apos;t stop economic growth .
Because that &apos;s what will stop : economic growth .
It will stop because of the end of trade resources .
Come on , you &apos;re thinking .
That &apos;s not possible .
Technology is amazing . People are innovative .
We can surely sort this out .
That &apos;s all true .
Well , it &apos;s mostly true .
The problem is we &apos;re just warming up this growth engine .
China plans to be there in just 20 years .
We need it to develop technology .
We need it to keep social stability .
It &apos;s like the Earth doesn &apos;t care what we need .
And these are not esoteric limits .
It certainly is .
And that &apos;s what will happen to us .
If it &apos;s that bad , we &apos;ll react .
Let &apos;s just think through that idea .
Now we &apos;ve had 50 years of warnings .
We &apos;ve had science proving the urgency of change .
We &apos;re not even slowing down .
I actually don &apos;t say this in despair .
I &apos;ve done my grieving about the loss .
I accept where we are .
It is sad , but it is what it is .
So when does this transition begin ?
When does this breakdown begin ?
In my view , it is well underway .
I know most people don &apos;t see it that way .
I want to talk to you about fear .
The crisis is now inevitable .
This issue is , how will we react ?
Of course , we can &apos;t know what will happen .
The future is inherently uncertain .
Perhaps denial .
Perhaps anger .
Maybe fear .
You can &apos;t see the danger at your door .
Think about war .
And the good news , this one &apos;s a monster .
There &apos;s certainly no technical or economic barrier in the way .
We can do it with proven technology .
We can do it at an affordable cost .
We can do it with existing political structures .
And this is where you come in .
But fear can be paralyzing or motivating .
We need to act like the future depends on it .
We need to act like we only have one planet .
We can do this .
They &apos;re wrong .
We can be more , we can be much more .
The Earth can support that if we choose the right path .
We can choose life over fear .
This could be our finest hour .
Thank you .
Markus Fischer : A robot that flies like a bird
It is a dream of mankind to fly like a bird .
Birds are very agile .
So we bring a team together .
So be careful later on .
So why do we do all this ?
Thank you .
So we can now look at the SmartBird .
So here is one without a skin .
We have a wingspan of about two meters .
And it is all out of carbon fiber .
And if we now beat up and down ...
we have the possibility to fly like a bird .
We have to turn it , go up and go down .
We have a split wing .
Also , we see how we measure the aerodynamic efficiency .
Thank you .
Markus , I think that we should fly it once more .
Markus Fischer : Yeah , sure .
Geoffrey West : The surprising math of cities and corporations
Cities are the crucible of civilization .
That &apos;s where all these problems come from .
Here &apos;s some numbers .
It &apos;s now more than 82 percent .
The planet has crossed the halfway mark a few years ago .
China &apos;s building 300 new cities in the next 20 years .
This is going to affect everything .
So we have this kind of dual nature .
Now these are my comrades in arms .
That &apos;s the question .
That &apos;s the quest .
Is that conceivable ?
Are there universal laws ?
The first is : Are cities part of biology ?
Is London a great big whale ?
Is Edinburgh a horse ?
Is Microsoft a great big anthill ?
What do we learn from that ?
Very few cities fail .
All companies die , all companies .
So is that just another version of this ?
Well we understand this very well .
And the idea is can we do the same for this ?
We &apos;re going to discuss that in a moment more .
That &apos;s called growth .
Here &apos;s how you grew .
Rat , that &apos;s a rat -- could have been you .
We &apos;re all pretty much the same .
And you see , you &apos;re very familiar with this .
You grow very quickly and then you stop .
This is just the weight versus the age .
And you see , it stops growing .
This is what we believe .
Okay , so how do we understand this ?
So let &apos;s first talk about biology .
Something else is going on .
And here &apos;s the point of that .
There is an extraordinary regularity .
And the reason for this is because of networks .
And you &apos;re very familiar with these networks .
That &apos;s a little thing that lives inside an elephant .
And here &apos;s the summary of what I &apos;m saying .
Don &apos;t know . We will discuss that .
Here &apos;s just a symbolic picture of that .
And here &apos;s scaling of cities .
There is a scaling .
The slope of that is less than linear .
There is an economy of scale .
But here &apos;s what &apos;s surprising .
It scales in the same way everywhere .
And what you see is a scaling phenomenon .
And here , they &apos;re all plotted together .
And you can see , they all follow the same line .
And here &apos;s the statement .
What is the reason for this ?
Something universal is going on .
And it is our interactions and the clustering of those interactions .
So there it is , I &apos;ve said it again .
The bigger you are , life gets faster .
On the left is the heart rate showing biology .
Lastly , I want to talk about growth .
This is what we had in biology , just to repeat .
Economies of scale gave rise to this sigmoidal behavior .
You grow fast and then stop -- part of our resilience .
That would be bad for economies and cities .
We have to accelerate on a continuous basis .
See companies , they scale .
It &apos;s the same plot .
We could use sales , anything you like .
And I &apos;m only showing you a little bit of this .
There &apos;s Walmart . Doesn &apos;t look very sigmoidal .
That &apos;s what we like , hockey sticks .
Let &apos;s go up to 2008 .
That red line is from the theory .
And then this is repeated across the entire spectrum of companies .
There they are . That &apos;s 23,000 companies .
Thank you .
David Bismark : E-voting without fraud
Our democracies rely on elections .
Without that mandate , they would be corrupt .
The ballot boxes go to counting places .
So we have to trust a lot of people .
We have to trust a lot of procedures .
And sometimes we even have to trust computers .
They &apos;ve zoomed out and looked at the big picture .
And the big picture is this : elections should be verifiable .
And that &apos;s the tough part .
And the secret is the ballot form .
So this is how you vote .
And you shred the candidate list .
So you let a poll station worker scan your encrypted vote .
So you take this encrypted vote home as your receipt .
No hacker can break in and find out how you voted .
But the election magic doesn &apos;t stop there .
They can check that all the votes were counted correctly .
And these are elections by the people , for the people .
Thank you .
Grégoire Courtine : The paralyzed rat that walked
I still remember this decisive moment .
These words , they stuck with me .
But how to make it happen ?
My idea : We awaken this network .
He listened to me carefully , and responded with a grin .
&quot; Why don &apos;t you try ? &quot;
Imagine that the locomotor system is a car .
The engine is the spinal cord .
The transmission is interrupted . The engine is turned off .
How could we re-engage the engine ?
Immediately , the paralyzed rat can stand .
This was amazing .
This locomotion was completely involuntary .
The animal had virtually no control over the legs .
Clearly , the steering system was missing .
Imagine , this is really cool .
We were so frustrated .
In fact -- Thank you .
But the remaining question was , how ?
I mean , how is it possible ?
And here , what we found was completely unexpected .
But the remodeling was not restricted to the lesion area .
And there is a very important message hidden behind this discovery .
This is truly a trans-disciplinary team .
And me ?
I am only the maestro who orchestrated this beautiful symphony .
Me too , every day .
The truth is that we don &apos;t know enough yet .
Imagine a person just suffered a spinal cord injury .
Thank you .
Alain de Botton : A kinder , gentler philosophy of success
There is a real problem with snobbery .
Because sometimes people from outside the U.K.
The bad news is that &apos;s not true .
Snobbery is a global phenomenon .
We are a global organization . This is a global phenomenon .
It exists . What is a snob ?
That is snobbery .
The dominant kind of snobbery that exists nowadays is job snobbery .
Now , the opposite of a snob is your mother .
But unfortunately , most people are not our mothers .
I don &apos;t think we are particularly materialistic .
And that &apos;s a new way of looking at luxury goods .
In other words -- feel sympathy , rather than contempt .
We &apos;ve done away with the caste system .
And it &apos;s a beautiful idea .
There are no strictly defined kind of hierarchies .
Even though she is much richer than any of you are .
And she &apos;s got a very large house .
She &apos;s simply too strange .
She comes from an odd place .
And yet , they &apos;re not .
But the point is , it doesn &apos;t feel that way .
And the consequences of this problem make themselves felt in bookshops .
In other words , what is a meritocratic society ?
And that makes failure seem much more crushing .
They own their success . But they also own their failure .
Let &apos;s take meritocracy .
I am a meritocrat in that sense .
It &apos;s not the post that should count .
But something very valuable in that idea , nevertheless .
You don &apos;t necessarily know what someone &apos;s true value is .
That is an unknown part of them .
And we shouldn &apos;t behave as though it is known .
There is another source of solace and comfort for all this .
And then are fit for ridicule .
Now is there any alternative to this ?
I gave them the plotline of Madame Bovary .
Again , a book they were enchanted to discover .
And then my favorite .
It would be insane to call Hamlet a loser .
He is not a loser , though he has lost .
We think very highly of ourselves , and so we should .
And so we tend to worship ourselves .
Our heroes are human heroes .
That &apos;s a very new situation .
Here &apos;s an insight that I &apos;ve had about success .
You can &apos;t be successful at everything .
We hear a lot of talk about work-life balance .
Psychoanalysis has been drumming home this message for about 80 years .
We are highly open to suggestion .
So I &apos;m going to end it there .
But let &apos;s accept the strangeness of some of our ideas .
Let &apos;s probe away at our notions of success .
Thank you very much .
Because otherwise it can get quite claustrophobic .
Or do you think that you can &apos;t ?
And your ideal dad is somebody who is tough but gentle .
And it &apos;s a very hard line to make .
Alain de Botton .
Thank you very much .
David Pogue : 10 top time-saving tech tips
I &apos;ve noticed something interesting about society and culture .
That &apos;s true in everything risky except technology .
You &apos;re supposed to learn this stuff how ?
Do that only if you &apos;re paid by the hour .
Instead , hit the space bar .
The space bar scrolls down one page .
Hold down the Shift key to scroll back up again .
So space bar to scroll down one page .
It works in every browser on every kind of computer .
You make the text larger with each tap .
Just hit the space bar twice .
Go space , space . It is totally amazing .
Here &apos;s something that drives me crazy .
I &apos;m not bitter .
Answering machine : At the tone , please — BEEP .
I didn &apos;t say these were going to be perfect .
You don &apos;t even have to click anything .
There &apos;s the definition as you type .
It &apos;s also a complete FAA database .
Type the name of the airline and the flight .
It &apos;s also a unit and currency conversion .
It neatly selects just that word .
Also , don &apos;t delete what you &apos;ve highlighted .
Much more precise . Again , don &apos;t bother deleting .
Just type over it .
It &apos;s extremely frustrating on any camera under 1,000 dollars .
You get it every time .
In the meantime , congratulations .
You all get your California technology license .
Have a great day .
Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala : Want to help Africa ? Do business here
And sometimes I &apos;m puzzled , and I ask myself why .
This is the Africa of opportunity .
Alamieyeseigha was arraigned in London .
That is that people talk about corruption , corruption .
I want to tell you that .
So we decided to privatize many of our enterprises .
Having a telephone in my country was a huge luxury .
You couldn &apos;t get it . You had to bribe .
You had to do everything to get your phone .
So the market is there .
So privatization is one of the things we &apos;ve done .
When they crashed , we crashed .
And that shores up our economy , makes it stable .
We brought inflation down from 28 percent to about 11 percent .
Agriculture grew at better than eight percent .
We have opportunities in agriculture , like I said .
We have opportunities in housing and real estate .
Barclays Bank of the U.K. is bringing in 500 million .
Standard Chartered has brought in 140 million .
We are doing the same with the insurance sector .
So in financial services , a great deal of opportunity .
In tourism , in many African countries , a great opportunity .
This is better than the performance of many OECD countries .
So it &apos;s clear that things are changing .
And I want to just make one point about this investment .
Otherwise , I would have liked you to have seen this .
It says , &quot; Africa : Open for Business . &quot;
For 10,000 pieces .
Nobody thinks there &apos;s opportunity .
So I invite you to explore the opportunities .
Thank you very much .
Bobby Ghosh : Why global jihad is losing
Do you hate Americans ?
What is your connection to Osama bin Laden ? &quot;
What does that mean for us in the West ?
They use his rhetoric .
They even use the brand name he created for his jihad .
They &apos;re fighting battles over much narrower issues .
But that doesn &apos;t mean that we can relax .
It &apos;s old school al Qaeda .
You may remember these guys .
But they have been distracted recently .
When those Mujahideen defeated the Soviet Union , we disengaged .
The good news is that it doesn &apos;t have to be .
We know how to fight it now .
Who ended the global jihad ?
There lie the answers to the solution to local jihad .
He probably thought 9 / 11 was his greatest achievement .
9 / 11 didn &apos;t empower him ; it doomed him .
Who killed bin Ladenism ? Abu Musab al-Zarqawi killed it .
Who killed Osama bin Laden ? The SEAL Team Six .
We don &apos;t have to reinvent the wheel .
We don &apos;t have to go back to that .
We &apos;ve got plenty of these things .
Bin Laden is dead . Bin Ladenism has been defeated .
His definition of jihad can now be expunged .
Thank you .
Kenichi Ebina : My magic moves
Martin Villeneuve : How I made an impossible film
&quot; Mars et Avril &quot; is a science fiction film .
It &apos;s set in Montreal some 50 years in the future .
But in fact I had 10 percent of that budget .
I did &quot; Mars et Avril &quot; for only 2.3 million .
So you might wonder , what &apos;s the deal here ?
How did I do this ?
The second aspect is love .
I got tons and tons of generosity from everyone involved .
But let me go back in time a bit .
And I just love this guy .
His career I admire a lot .
Because this guy is the busiest man on the planet .
But that &apos;s kind of a big problem .
I welded the breech , but the valve is still gaping .
They are objects of desire .
They are imaginary musical instruments .
And they carry a nice story with them .
So that &apos;s kind of a big problem too .
How do you get something that you can &apos;t afford ?
He took a leap of faith .
So here they are .
Why ? Because I offered him a space to dream .
I have experienced it .
Thank you .
Paul Collier : New rules for rebuilding a broken nation
The record on post-conflict recovery is not very impressive .
Why has the record been so poor ?
The first principle is : it &apos;s the politics that matters .
So , the first thing that is prioritized is politics .
Try and build a political settlement first .
So , short-term peacekeepers .
And thirdly , what is the exit strategy for the peacekeepers ?
It &apos;s an election .
That will produce a legitimate and accountable government .
So that &apos;s the conventional approach .
I think that approach denies reality .
We see that there is no quick fix .
There &apos;s certainly no quick security fix .
And the risks stay high throughout the decade .
And they stay high regardless of the political innovations .
Does an election produce an accountable and legitimate government ?
What an election produces is a winner and a loser .
And the loser is unreconciled .
The reality is that we need to reverse the sequence .
Why does the politics get easier ?
And why is it so difficult initially ?
And that doesn &apos;t produce a productive politics .
So that is what you get when you face reality .
But the objective of facing reality is to change reality .
The first actor is the Security Council .
It is a cost-effective approach .
It does increase security .
But it needs to be done long-term .
That &apos;s one actor , the Security Council .
The donors provide post-conflict aid .
They moved on to some other situation .
Post-conflict economic recovery is a slow process .
There are no quick processes in economics except decline .
You can do that quite fast .
And then the third key actor is the post-conflict government .
And there are two key things it &apos;s got to do .
It &apos;s got to reform economic policy .
Why ? Because during conflict economic policy typically deteriorates .
So this legacy of conflict is really bad economic policy .
The inclusion agenda doesn &apos;t come from elections .
Elections produce a loser , who is then excluded .
So the inclusion agenda means genuinely bringing people inside the tent .
So those three actors .
And they are interdependent over a long term .
And so we need a post-conflict compact .
So that &apos;s idea one : recognize interdependence .
And that is to focus on a few critical objectives .
One is jobs .
So jobs , health , and clean government .
Those are the three critical priorities .
Jobs .
What is a distinctive approach to generating jobs in post-conflict situations ?
And why are jobs so important ?
Jobs for whom ? Especially jobs for young men .
It &apos;s because young men get upset .
Now , that is difficult .
That is not a good idea .
It &apos;s not sustainable .
These are not environments where you can build export manufacturing .
But typically that sector has withered away during conflict .
During conflict people are doing destruction .
What might the bottlenecks be ?
First you need access to land .
We need firms . The firms have gone away .
So we need to encourage the growth of local firms .
Neither of those approaches is sensible .
One advantage of that is that you can allocate money coherently .
Another is , you can make NGOs accountable .
They want to have the discipline and accountability .
So that &apos;s a way to get basic services scaled up .
So , jobs , basic services , finally , clean government .
Clean means follow their money .
And so inadvertently we empower the people who are the problem .
What &apos;s the goal ?
If we follow this , what would we hope to achieve ?
So that &apos;s the focus on the construction sector .
Where would that leave us ?
George Whitesides : Toward a science of simplicity
The trouble is , I don &apos;t .
The quote is from the fabled Potter Stewart opinion on pornography .
But I know it when I see it . &quot;
I &apos;m going to come back to that in a moment .
So , what is simplicity ?
It &apos;s good to start with some examples .
Why is that important ?
Well , it enables you to drink coffee .
And the two here are just examples .
One is the cellphone , which we use every day .
The teapot problem I &apos;ll pose this way .
And that &apos;s a simple question .
It &apos;s like , what is simplicity ?
All of these are possibilities .
What is the state of science ?
And , interestingly , complexity is very highly evolved .
We have a lot of interesting information about what complexity is .
We academics -- I am an academic -- we love complexity .
You &apos;re not interested in the limits of these things .
It is a system , like traffic , which has components .
The components interact with one another .
These are cars and drivers . They dissipate energy .
And it &apos;s like the traffic that you see .
Anyone who tells you that we understand life , walk away .
And let me reduce this to the simplest level .
We &apos;ve heard from Bill Gates recently .
Terrific . You learn everything you can about that .
That &apos;s a Bono , this is a Bono .
The answer is , not a lot .
And that &apos;s complexity .
The Internet starts with mathematics , it starts with binary .
In binary , one is 0001 , seven is 0111 .
The question is : Why is binary simpler than Arabic ?
Anything else is more complicated .
They can be on and off . That &apos;s binary .
Now wall switches , we all know , fail .
A transistor is nothing more than a wall switch .
With integrated circuits , you can build cellphones .
And from that comes the Internet .
And this is a map of bitflows across the continent .
And then back to simplicity again .
Their behavior is predictable .
So simplicity and predictability are characteristics of simple things .
So , for example , stones .
That is , you can stack them .
It just is not possible .
So these are the components .
So , how does one do that ?
It &apos;s a little paper chip .
It wicks its way up into these little branches .
You know , no power required .
So you can &apos;t make it too simple .
This is by de Saint-Exupery .
And that certainly is going in the right direction .
Thank you very much .
Quick question .
Have you started to do that ?
GW : Well , no .
How do I put that simply ? No .
That was a simple , powerful answer . GW : Yes .
You &apos;ve got a company set up to ...
GW : A foundation , a foundation . Not-for-profit .
Rachel Botsman : The case for collaborative consumption
Now I &apos;m going to start with a deceptively simple example .
Now my husband , Chris , and I love this show .
So what &apos;s happening here ?
Namely , that technology is enabling trust between strangers .
I call this &quot; groundswell collaborative consumption . &quot;
It &apos;s second nature to them .
So all of this is a lot of twittering , right ?
Three , pressing unresolved environmental concerns .
The first is redistribution markets .
The second is collaborative lifestyles .
One of my favorite examples of collaborative lifestyles is called Landshare .
It &apos;s a scheme in the U.K.
Together they grow their own food .
Now , the third system is product-service systems .
This idea is particularly powerful for things that have high-idling capacity .
It &apos;s kind of ridiculous , right ?
Because what you need is the hole , not the drill .
I &apos;m not asking people to share nicely in the sandpit .
The average car costs 8,000 dollars a year to run .
Yet , that car sits idle for 23 hours a day .
They could only use their Zipcar membership when absolutely necessary .
The results of this challenge after just one month was staggering .
Now products-service systems have been around for years .
Just think of libraries and laundrettes .
This represents an eight-year time span .
But now with the Web , we leave a trail .
Let &apos;s go back to my first example , Swaptree .
In other words , I can trust him or her .
And this reputation capital will determine our access to collaborative consumption .
I &apos;m on a mission to make sharing cool .
I &apos;m on a mission to make sharing hip .
Thank you very much .
Malcolm London : &quot; High School Training Ground &quot;
Teachers paid less than what it costs them to be here .
This is a training ground .
My high school is Chicago , diverse and segregated on purpose .
Social lines are barbed wire .
Labels like &quot; Regulars &quot; and &quot; Honors &quot; resonate .
The need for degrees has left so many people frozen .
Omar Ahmad : Political change with pen and paper
You actually put action to the issues you care about .
So , how do you do that ?
You can send them an email .
It doesn &apos;t matter , it &apos;s spam .
How about you get on the phone ?
That doesn &apos;t move .
So what actually works ?
And the answer is rather strange .
It &apos;s a letter .
Letters actually work .
So , how are you going to write your letter ?
And it is critical that you actually handwrite your letter .
They don &apos;t spend a lot of time dicking around .
So , here you go .
Ad hominem attacks will get you nowhere .
&quot; Obviously , you &apos;re intelligent .
Lastly , you want to be the nurturing agent .
You &apos;re the safe place to come in to .
Why is is this important ?
Here &apos;s how you mail your letter .
So , you send the copy to the main office .
Get writing .
Damian Palin : Mining minerals from seawater
I collaborate with bacteria .
And this attracts metals from their local environment .
And the desalination process is one where we take out salts .
We can use it for drinking and agriculture .
So seawater reverse osmosis is a membrane-filtration technology .
We take the water from the sea and we apply pressure .
And this pressure forces the seawater through a membrane .
This takes energy , producing clean water .
But this will produce an equally massive amount of desalination brine .
And this is where my collaboration with bacteria comes into play .
Thank you .
Drew Dudley : Everyday leadership
We &apos;ve made into something beyond us .
We &apos;ve made it about changing the world .
&quot; It was awesome .
This girl right here knows exactly what I &apos;m talking about .
He just kind of held the lollipop out like this . &quot;
And she walks away , and I &apos;m flattened .
I &apos;m still dating that guy four years later . &quot;
Here &apos;s the kicker . I don &apos;t remember that .
Our greatest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure .
Shane Koyczan : To This Day ... for the bullied and beautiful
There &apos;s so many of you .
But that &apos;s what we were told .
Stand up for yourself .
Geek . Fatty . Slut . Fag .
I always thought that was an unfair question .
It presupposes that we can &apos;t be what we already are .
We were kids .
When I was a kid , I wanted to shave .
Now , not so much .
When I was 11 , I wanted to be left alone .
And they said , &quot; Choose something realistic . &quot;
So I said , &quot; Professional wrestler . &quot;
And they said , &quot; Don &apos;t be stupid . &quot;
And I wasn &apos;t the only one .
Granted , my dreams are shy , because they &apos;re Canadian .
My dreams are self-conscious and overly apologetic .
See , my dreams got called names too .
Silly . Foolish . Impossible .
But I kept dreaming .
I was going to be The Garbage Man .
My finishing move was going to be The Trash Compactor .
I was crushed , as if by a trash compactor .
Poetry .
Standing up for yourself doesn &apos;t have to mean embracing violence .
This is who I am .
This is how I stand up for myself .
I thought they were both pork chops .
Not really a big deal .
I saw no reason to lie .
As far as I was concerned , life was pretty good .
To this day , I hate pork chops .
But the school halls were a battleground .
We found ourselves outnumbered day after wretched day .
We weren &apos;t the only kids who grew up this way .
To this day , kids are still being called names .
It was practice , and yes , some of us fell .
You signed it , &quot; They were wrong . &quot;
Maybe they decided to pick you last for basketball or everything .
You have to believe that they were wrong .
They have to be wrong .
Why else would we still be here ?
We only got out to walk and get gas .
Of course they did .
Raffaello D &apos;Andrea : The astounding athletic power of quadcopters
So what does it mean for a machine to be athletic ?
Quads have been around for a long time .
So , how did it just do that ?
The bulk of our research is algorithms .
It &apos;s the magic that brings these machines to life .
We use something broadly called model-based design .
We first captured the dynamics with a set of differential equations .
Let me demonstrate the strength of this approach .
How did we design the algorithms to do this ?
It naturally doesn &apos;t spill no matter what the quad does .
In this instance , carrying a glass of water is easy .
Balancing a pole is hard .
Can a machine also perform with extreme physical damage ?
Or do they ?
Mathematical models tell us exactly when and why this is possible .
Will the diver be able to pull off a rip entry ?
Will the vaulter stick the landing ?
There simply isn &apos;t enough time .
Striking a moving ball is a necessary skill in many sports .
We first figure out where the ball is going .
These three quads are cooperatively carrying a sky net .
Notice that , at full extension , these quads are vertical .
Take this quad , for example .
It &apos;s trying to stay at a fixed point in space .
We can change this behavior , however .
We now have an intimate way of interacting with a machine .
Let &apos;s have a little bit of fun with this .
Okay , here goes .
Whew !
Let me introduce you to the wizards behind the green curtain .
Look out for them . They &apos;re destined for great things .
Thank you .
Thomas Goetz : It &apos;s time to redesign medical data
Because we are all patients , we are all people .
Even doctors are patients at some point .
It goes all the way back to Aristotle .
And doctors hate it , right ?
I mean , they complain about it all the time .
We talk about it in terms of engagement , or non-compliance .
Not a lot of cool , sexy stuff happening in dentistry .
People brush and floss their teeth .
They had a big patient population .
They divided them up into two groups .
So that was the low-fear group .
The high-fear group , they laid it on really thick .
They showed bloody gums .
They showed puss oozing out from between their teeth .
They told them that their teeth were going to fall out .
You &apos;ll eat mush for the rest of your life .
So go brush and floss your teeth .
That was the message . That was the experiment .
Now they measured one other variable .
So the upshot was this .
So fear showed up as not really the driver .
It was the sense of efficacy .
It &apos;s an amazing notion .
Except , maybe we do .
This is a campaign from the American Diabetes Association .
This is still the way we &apos;re communicating messages about health .
And I don &apos;t know if it works .
Now here &apos;s what does work : personalized information works .
Again , Bandura recognized this years ago , decades ago .
So let me just spool it out a little bit .
But it actually hits home .
It &apos;s a difficult and expensive commodity , until now .
And here &apos;s how they work in the feedback loop .
The choice in this case is pretty simple .
We either keep going fast , or we slow down .
They reduce speeds by about five to 10 percent .
But it works , and it even has some health repercussions .
Your blood pressure might drop a little bit .
It &apos;s very difficult to line things up so neatly .
But we have an opportunity .
This is a pharmaceutical ad .
But it looks completely right .
Because we know .
Who among us would actually say that people read this ?
This is a bankrupt effort at communicating health information .
There is no good faith in this .
So this is a different approach .
So let me just walk through this quickly .
You can understand exactly what the benefits are .
And finally , you understand what those choices are .
So I love this . I love that drug facts box .
And so I came up with this : lab test results .
Blood test results are this great source of information .
They &apos;re packed with information .
They go right to doctors .
This is the worst presented information .
So that &apos;s what I want to walk you through .
This is our one-page summary .
We use the notion of color .
It &apos;s an amazing notion that color could be used .
We tell you that you &apos;re okay , you &apos;re normal .
So that &apos;s our general blood work test .
Then we went to CRP test .
In this case , it &apos;s a sin of omission .
What you &apos;re actually measuring is spelled out in clean language .
The last one I &apos;ll show you is a PSA test .
Here &apos;s the before , and here &apos;s the after .
We again personalized the risks .
And then again , the follow-up actions .
That &apos;s what Wired magazine spent on this .
Why is Wired magazine doing this ?
It should be the patient .
This is information that is incredibly powerful .
It &apos;s an incredibly powerful catalyst to change .
It &apos;s being lost .
But you can create your own feedback loop .
And the only acceptable answer is -- -- yes .
And then , what &apos;s next ?
This is not beyond the grasp of ordinary people .
That &apos;s what engagement is . It &apos;s different from compliance .
And this information is out there .
Thank you very much .
Kate Orff : Reviving New York &apos;s rivers -- with oysters !
But one thing is clear .
So the era of big infrastructure is over .
We need new tools and new approaches .
So we need new stories , new heroes and new tools .
Another set of views of actually the Gowanus Canal itself .
Now the Gowanus is particularly smelly -- I will admit it .
So we really had a lot to deal with .
And the idea has two core stages .
Here we are , back to our hero , the oyster .
And again , it &apos;s this incredibly exciting animal .
They were key in our culture and our economy .
They really become nature &apos;s wave attenuators .
And they become the bedrock of any harbor ecosystem .
Many , many species depend on them .
What is fuzzy rope , you ask ?
So get your Tevas on .
So you can imagine scuba diving here .
So the water is churned through this raft .
So rather than having 10 oysters , you have 10,000 oysters .
And then those spat are then seeded .
New word .
And also showing oyster gardening for the community along its edges .
I get asked two questions about this project .
One is : why isn &apos;t it happening now ?
And the answer is : not yet , they &apos;re working .
Thank you .
Stephen Cave : The 4 stories we tell ourselves about death
What did it mean that he was dead ?
Where had he gone ?
Could that hole in reality open up and swallow me ?
Our idea of death develops as we grow older .
And this development in childhood reflects the development of our species .
This is , if you like , our curse .
It &apos;s the price we pay for being so damn clever .
We each live in the shadow of a personal apocalypse .
And that &apos;s frightening . It &apos;s terrifying .
And so we look for a way out .
Now this didn &apos;t sound very plausible .
Now we can see this as the biggest bias of all .
It has been demonstrated in over 400 empirical studies .
Now these studies are ingenious , but they &apos;re simple .
They work like this .
Now , one group was asked to think about being dead .
The other group was asked to think about being lonely .
They were then asked again about their religious beliefs .
Twice as likely .
Even though the before they were all equally agnostic .
Now , the first story is the simplest .
Ancient Egypt had such myths , ancient Babylon , ancient India .
In other words , I can do what Jesus did .
All you need is an Internet connection and a funny cat .
I want to live on in my apartment . &quot;
Well the Greek philosopher Epicurus thought we could .
And so it should be with us .
Thank you .
Richard Resnick : Welcome to the genomic revolution
Ladies and gentlemen , I present to you the human genome .
Chromosome one , top left .
Bottom right are the sex chromosomes .
How many are there in the human genome ? Three billion .
Is that a big number ?
Well , everybody can throw around big numbers .
So it &apos;s really quite big .
That was all done on a machine that looks like this .
It &apos;s called the Beijing Genomics Institute .
What does this mean for medicine ?
So a woman is age 37 .
She presents with stage 2 estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer .
She is treated with surgery , chemotherapy and radiation .
She goes home .
Unfortunately , treated again with surgery and chemotherapy .
Six months later , she comes back with acute myeloid leukemia .
She goes into respiratory failure and dies eight days later .
What they had was dopa-responsive dystonia .
Significant problems remained .
And so what he did was he got his kids sequenced .
Guys , this would never have happened without whole genome sequencing .
That &apos;s how fast this is moving .
So here &apos;s little Nick -- likes Batman and squirt guns .
But the gene that regulates that down is broken .
Today , it &apos;s here .
None , not one .
And then more general versions of word processors came about .
Look , this is where we are today .
So I just recently had to buy life insurance .
But what would have happened if I had said C ?
Consumer applications for genomics , they will flourish .
Personalized genomic massage anyone ?
And it looks really good .
Do you think that &apos;s not going to happen ?
Do you think it would have helped John McCain ?
Anybody ? Nobody .
Typically , there &apos;s one or two .
So my father &apos;s father was one of 10 Resnick brothers .
They all hated each other .
And they all moved to different parts of the planet .
Now this is probably a good thing , right ?
You have bigger clan gatherings and so on .
But maybe it &apos;s a bad thing as well .
How many fathers in the room ? Raise your hands .
Thank you .
Alain de Botton : Atheism 2.0
Now I think it &apos;s too easy .
Now what is Atheism 2.0 ?
I can &apos;t believe in the doctrines .
I don &apos;t think these doctrines are right .
I really like the art of Mantegna .
I really like looking at old churches .
I really like turning the pages of the Old Testament . &quot;
Until now , these people have faced a rather unpleasant choice .
So that &apos;s a sort of tough choice .
I don &apos;t think we have to make that choice .
I think there is an alternative .
The secular world is full of holes .
We have secularized badly , I would argue .
I &apos;d like to kick off by looking at education .
Now education is a field the secular world really believes in .
That &apos;s a lovely idea .
Interesting where it came from .
They asked themselves the following question .
And influential voices came up with one answer .
They said culture .
They wanted to replace scripture with culture .
And that &apos;s a very plausible idea .
It &apos;s also an idea that we have forgotten .
Why ? They don &apos;t think we need it .
They see us as adults , rational adults .
What we need is information .
We need data , we don &apos;t need help .
Now religions start from a very different place indeed .
We &apos;re only just holding it together .
Perhaps this is just me , maybe you .
But anyway , we &apos;re only just holding it together .
And we need help . Of course , we need help .
And so we need guidance and we need didactic learning .
Now we &apos;ve given up with the idea of sermons .
I &apos;m an independent , individual person . &quot;
Religions go , &quot; Nonsense .
You need to keep repeating the lesson 10 times a day .
So get on your knees and repeat it . &quot;
Otherwise our minds are like sieves .
So religions are cultures of repetition .
They circle the great truths again and again and again .
We associate repetition with boredom .
&quot; Give us the new , &quot; we &apos;re always saying .
&quot; The new is better than the old . &quot;
Not so if you &apos;re adopting a religious mindset .
The other things that religions do is to arrange time .
All the major religions give us calendars .
What is a calendar ?
Now we don &apos;t think that way .
I &apos;ll just come across it . &quot;
Nonsense , says the religious world view .
It sets things into perspective , etc . , etc .
You &apos;ll be handed rice cakes .
That &apos;s very good .
But the religious world doesn &apos;t think that way .
And we &apos;d know that we had a real rhythm going .
So for example , take the Jewish idea of forgiveness .
They don &apos;t just deliver us sermons on this .
They don &apos;t just give us books or words about this .
They tell us to have a bath .
We don &apos;t tend to do that .
Let &apos;s look at art now .
A lot of our surplus wealth goes to museums , etc .
You &apos;ve heard that saying .
I couldn &apos;t disagree more .
But that feeling of puzzlement is structural to contemporary art .
Now religions have a much saner attitude to art .
They have no trouble telling us what art is about .
Art is about two things in all the major faiths .
And that &apos;s what art is .
Essentially it &apos;s propaganda .
Rembrandt is a propagandist in the Christian view .
Now the word &quot; propaganda &quot; sets off alarm bells .
Propaganda is a manner of being didactic in honor of something .
All works of art are talking to us about things .
Art should be didactic .
Let &apos;s think of something else .
And they tend to be on their own .
And they get depressed and they get sad on their own .
And they don &apos;t really change much .
Now think about religions , think about organized religions .
What do organized religions do ?
They group together , they form institutions .
And that has all sorts of advantages .
First of all , scale , might .
These are massive machines .
These are all very good qualities .
We recognize them in relation to corporations .
They &apos;re selling us shoes and cars .
We need to group together .
And that &apos;s what religions do .
That &apos;s something we can learn from .
I want to conclude .
Look very closely at pilgrimage .
Thank you very much .
You can get shot by both sides .
Incoming missiles from North Oxford at any moment .
Indeed .
Is there any room for that experience in Atheism 2.0 ?
Actually , let me just ask a question .
One wants to say , &quot; Nonsense . Why not ? &quot;
And that &apos;s really the spirit of my talk .
There &apos;s so much we can absorb .
No , we need to be polite about differences .
Politeness is a much-overlooked virtue .
It &apos;s seen as hypocrisy .
You move on .
They &apos;ve ignored the possibility of harmonious disagreement .
It doesn &apos;t need it .
I &apos;ve sketched a sort of broad framework .
So it &apos;s a wiki project .
Alain , thank you for sparking many conversations later .
I &apos;m a gamer , so I like to have goals .
I like special missions and secret objectives .
Okay , some of you are looking a little bit skeptical .
And it won &apos;t make a lot of sense now .
Now , you have a secret mission too .
Now , I want to take this problem seriously .
So I have been thinking about this question a lot lately .
Number one : I wish I hadn &apos;t worked so hard .
Number three : I wish I had let myself be happier .
For example , I wish I hadn &apos;t worked so hard .
I wish I &apos;d stayed in touch with my friends .
I wish I &apos;d let myself be happier .
And we &apos;re going to come back to this one .
Really wanting to die .
Now let me tell you that story .
So I had to avoid everything that triggered my symptoms .
It said , you &apos;re never going to get better .
It said , the pain will never end .
Now , why a game ?
This was an easier way to ask for help .
We also collected and activated power-ups .
Now what happened next with the game surprised me .
Even people were playing it for terminal diagnoses like ALS .
They talked about feeling stronger and braver .
They talked about feeling better understood by their friends and family .
Well , it turns out there &apos;s some science here too .
Some people get stronger and happier after a traumatic event .
And that &apos;s what was happening to us .
We usually hear about post-traumatic stress disorder .
I feel closer to my friends and family .
I &apos;m better able to focus on my goals and dreams .
Now , does this sound familiar ?
Now this is interesting , right ?
But how does it work ?
How do you get from trauma to growth ?
That would be good , right ?
So here &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
We &apos;re going to play a quick game together .
Very good .
That &apos;s all it takes .
Everybody ready for your next quest ?
Go !
Don &apos;t give up .
Bonus physical resilience . Well done , everyone .
It gets stronger the more you exercise it .
So good job . Quest number three .
If you &apos;re outside , find a window and look in .
So , what do we want to see ?
Baby dolphin and baby llamas . Everybody look .
Got that ?
Okay , one more . Baby elephant .
We &apos;re clapping for that ?
That &apos;s amazing .
And here &apos;s a secret from the scientific literature for you .
And this is called the three-to-one positive emotion ratio .
It &apos;s my favorite SuperBetter trick , so keep it up .
Looking good , looking good .
Nice , nice .
Keep it up . I love it !
Now , a great way to boost social resilience is gratitude .
Touch is even better .
So this is true .
Yeah ! Awesome .
Wait , wait , wait .
You still have your special mission , your secret mission .
Well , here &apos;s my suggestion .
Pretty clever , right ?
Thank you .
Caroline Phillips : Hurdy-gurdy for beginners
And in Spanish , &quot; zanfona . &quot;
And in Italian , &quot; ghironda , &quot; okay ?
Hurdy-gurdy , or wheel fiddle .
It has three different kinds of strings .
And the third string is pretty innovative .
Luckily , all of this changed a couple of centuries later .
It &apos;s made by specialized luthiers , also in Europe .
And it &apos;s very difficult to tune .
So without further ado , would you like to hear it ?
CP : Okay .
There I go .
&#91; Basque &#93; Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
Lauren Zalaznick : The conscience of television
So most everyone watches TV .
We like it . We like some parts of it .
Here in America , people actually love TV .
The average American watches TV for almost 5 hours a day .
Okay ?
But a lot of people don &apos;t love it so much .
They , in fact , berate it .
They call it stupid , and worse , believe me .
We &apos;re talking about popular TV .
We have the capacity to laugh and cry .
We feel awe , we feel pity .
That is separate and apart from the animal kingdom .
We love to watch TV .
This is something that clearly separates us from the animal kingdom .
Why has television entertainment evolved the way it has ?
How did you feel watching every single one of these shows ?
Did you feel a sense of moral ambiguity ?
Did you feel outrage ? Did you laugh ?
What did this mean for you ?
So I really hope our global audiences can relate .
Okay , here we go .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re watching TV for .
Moral ambiguity starts to climb .
Why ?
Look what happens .
In 1970 , inspiration plummets .
Moral ambiguity takes off .
It &apos;s trying to recover .
Take a look at this .
This chart is going to document a very similar trend .
This is rising . Comfort stays whole .
Irreverence starts to rise .
Social commentary is all of a sudden spiking up .
You get to 1969 , and look what happens .
What &apos;s number one ?
They &apos;re all living together , right .
Viewers had responded dramatically .
Look at this green spike in 1966 to a bellwether show .
That &apos;s what we mean by a breakout show .
In 1970 , the dam bursts . The dam bursts .
Comfort is no longer why we watch television .
Social commentary and irreverence rise throughout the 70s .
Now look at this .
The 70s means who ? Norman Lear .
It can make me feel this ?
It can change us ?
What were those shows ?
Glamorous and rich .
&quot; Dallas , &quot; &quot; Fantasy Island . &quot;
Everything &apos;s good , low unemployment .
But look : X marks the spot .
Why not ?
We had a 2000 presidential election decided by the Supreme Court .
We had the bursting of the tech bubble .
We had 9 / 11 .
Anthrax becomes part of the social lexicon .
Look what happens when we keep going .
What do people want in their TV then ?
I would have thought revenge or nostalgia .
Give me some comfort ; my world is falling apart .
No , they want judgment .
I can vote you off the island .
I can keep Sarah Palin &apos;s daughter dancing .
I can choose the next American Idol . You &apos;re fired .
That &apos;s all great , right ?
We &apos;re animals , we need our moms .
This era &apos;s mom , Bree Van de Kamp .
So thanks very much .
Ze Frank : Nerdcore comedy
It &apos;s such a large conference .
I invented the Placebo Camera .
Sincerely , Mister Michael Bangoora . &quot;
This is really embarrassing .
I was told backstage that I have 18 minutes .
I only prepared 15 .
I &apos;m really sorry .
What &apos;s your name ?
Are you a virgin ? Virgin ?
You don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about ?
Ah , Mark -- Serfaas .
1,860 -- am I good ?
And that &apos;s nothing to be ashamed of .
That &apos;s nothing to be ashamed of .
Really cool , we were getting wasted .
Am I feeling lucky ?
Am I feeling lucky ?
Audience : Yes .
Ze Frank : Oh . Amazing .
Needless to say , I was able to leave my job .
And , finally , you know , become freelance .
I -- I knew I had something .
It &apos;s like a microscope to the rest of the world .
For example , somebody wrote me .
And that was embarrassing .
I hear a lot of you whispering .
You can do heckler mode .
Voice : Hey , moron , get off the stage .
ZF : You get off the stage .
Voice : We want Malcolm Gladwell .
In case you run over time .
And frog mode .
I came up with a few games .
This is called &quot; Atheist . &quot;
I figured it &apos;d be popular with the young kids .
Look , I &apos;ll move around and say some things .
So that didn &apos;t go over so well .
I don &apos;t really understand why you &apos;re laughing .
Should have done this before I tried to pitch it .
But you come back as a duck .
It &apos;s the third in the series .
I &apos;m hoping it &apos;s going to do well this year .
Do you have a preference ? Good choice .
Over 500 entries in three weeks , toilet paper fashion .
I think they &apos;re wonderful .
In other words , it &apos;s a helping tool .
Darling . Beautiful stuff .
These are haikus .
Oh , this is how you make puppets .
Ladies and gentlemen , Mr. Ze Frank .
Yann Dall &apos;Aglio : Love -- you &apos;re doing it wrong
What is love ?
I can love jogging .
I can love a book , a movie .
I can love escalopes .
I can love my wife .
Think about the young woman who must remain chaste before marriage .
This phenomenon is modernity .
We can basically summarize it through a triple process .
Now it is quoted in the stock exchange .
Hence the anxiety of contemporary man .
He is obsessed : &quot; Am I desirable ? How desirable ?
How many people are going to love me ? &quot;
And how does he respond to this anxiety ?
Well , by hysterically collecting symbols of desirability .
Indeed , our consumer society is largely based on seduction capital .
It is said about this consumption that our age is materialistic .
Consumerism is not materialism .
These teachers call themselves &quot; pick-up artists . &quot;
So they are artists of picking up chicks .
And they call heartache &quot; one-itis . &quot;
One-itis can be translated as &quot; an infection from one . &quot;
We can also envision a romantic use of the genome .
But such a future doesn &apos;t have to be .
Another path to thinking about love may be possible .
But how ?
How to renounce the hysterical need to be valued ?
Well , by becoming aware of my uselessness .
Yes , I &apos;m useless .
But rest assured : so are you .
We are all useless .
I don &apos;t have any inherent value .
What is tenderness ?
To be tender is to accept the loved one &apos;s weaknesses .
It &apos;s not about becoming a sad couple of orderlies .
That &apos;s pretty bad .
It is a sort of poetry of deliberate awkwardness .
I refer to self-mockery .
Bjarke Ingels : 3 warp-speed architecture tales
He triggered the modernist revolution .
At each meeting , there &apos;s way too many ideas .
Only the best ones can survive .
We mate them . They have sort of mutant offspring .
As you can see , sometimes a subspecies branches off .
It doesn &apos;t really work in this context .
So as a result , we never throw anything out .
We keep our office almost like an archive of architectural biodiversity .
You never know when you might need it .
And we saw this guy , Haibao .
We even double checked .
So the People &apos;s Building , as we called it .
This is our two interpreters , sort of reading the architecture .
And we had the chance to explain the project .
So we obviously profoundly agreed with him .
Unfortunately , Mr. Chen is now in prison for corruption .
Sustainability .
China symbolized by the dragon .
Denmark , we have a national bird , the swan .
The biggest tourist attraction in China is the Great Wall .
The big tourist attraction in Denmark is The Little Mermaid .
That can actually hardly be seen from the canal tours .
And it sort of shows the difference between these two cities .
Copenhagen , Shanghai , modern , European .
This is how it looks today ; all traffic jam .
Bicycles have become forbidden many places .
Meanwhile , in Copenhagen we &apos;re actually expanding the bicycle lanes .
A third of all the people commute by bike .
We donate 1,000 bikes to Shanghai .
You can try it .
So quite often you load water for ballast .
So we can actually hitch a ride for free .
The first thing , the China map missed Taiwan .
They tried to pass a law against moving the Mermaid .
This is my apartment .
The house is sort of a distortion of a square block .
This is our first architectural model .
This is an aerial photo taken last summer .
And essentially , the apartments cover the parking .
They are accessed through this diagonal elevator .
The wood of your apartment continues outside becoming the facades .
They can actually have both .
Unfortunately , it was the national bank of Iceland .
So we took the commission .
We quite often make little movies .
They create shelter from the wind .
They accumulate the solar energy .
They accumulate the water .
So they actually transform the entire island into a single ecosystem .
Yes , maybe just to round off .
Thank you .
Joseph Lekuton : A parable for Kenya
My name is Joseph , a Member of Parliament in Kenya .
I had never in my life ever tasted candy .
Stayed when everybody else was dropping out .
My family moved ; we &apos;re nomads .
Fifty miles , 40 miles , it doesn &apos;t matter .
You slept in the bush , but you kept going .
And they were left behind , waiting to die .
But these two people worked something out .
We &apos;ll walk you , you lead us . &quot;
So I said , &quot; I &apos;m going to dedicate myself .
And I came for them , and that &apos;s my goal .
We &apos;re building dispensaries across that constituency .
I &apos;m trying to improve infrastructure .
Thank you very much .
Liz Diller : A new museum wing ... in a giant bubble
But we &apos;re less attuned to the nuances of the public .
What translates generic public space into qualitative space ?
And we &apos;re doing this through some case studies .
It really goes beyond distinction .
Now we &apos;re moving onto Washington , D.C.
The Mall is a symbol of American democracy .
It may just be a place for civic commiseration .
And could the museum be an agent of cultural diplomacy ?
There are over 180 embassies in Washington D.C.
There are over 500 think tanks .
There should be some kind of brain trust .
It would have the global reach of the World Economic Forum .
It would have the interdisciplinarity of the TED Conference .
It would have the informality of the town square .
Architects love to hate it .
And around that space , the ring is actually galleries .
Very , very difficult to mount shows in there .
Where would it go ?
It can &apos;t go in the Mall .
There is no space there .
It can &apos;t go in the courtyard .
It &apos;s already taken up by landscape and by sculptures .
Well there &apos;s always the hole .
How could it become iconic ?
And what language would it take ?
The Hirshhorn sits among the Mall &apos;s momumental institutions .
It has to be different from the buildings there .
It has to be something entirely different .
It has to be air .
In our imagination , it has to be light .
It has to be ephemeral . It has to be formless .
And it has to be free .
So this is the big idea .
It &apos;s a giant airbag .
The before and the after .
It was dubbed &quot; the bubble &quot; by the press .
That was the lounge .
The membrane is translucent .
It &apos;s made of silcon-coated glass fiber .
This is the view from the inside .
It had to be approved by actually two agencies .
I blush whenever I show this .
It is yours to interpret .
There was also some creative interpretation involved .
This pretty much exempts monuments of the church and state .
And the bubble is 153 ft .
That &apos;s the Pantheon next to it .
It &apos;s about 1.2 million cubic feet of compressed air .
And so we couldn &apos;t really touch its surfaces .
We couldn &apos;t leave any traces behind .
It glows from within , it &apos;s translucent .
So it &apos;s down the hierarchy on lighting .
So it comes to the site twice a year .
It &apos;s taken off the delivery truck .
It &apos;s hoisted .
And then it &apos;s inflated with this low-pressure air .
And then it &apos;s restrained with the cables .
And then it &apos;s ballasted with water at the very bottom .
And they really connected with that idea .
And then it was really easy all the way through .
But some of the toughest hurdles have been the technical ones .
This is the warp and weft .
This is a point cloud .
There are extreme pressures .
And I &apos;m just going to zip through these slides .
And this is the space in action .
Form and content are together here .
The bubble is an anti-monument .
Thank you .
Tim Ferriss : Smash fear , learn anything
This is Tim Ferriss circa 1979 A.D. Age two .
Obviously , you see the resemblance .
And this routine went on for some time .
When I was seven I went to summer camp .
My parents found it necessary for peace of mind .
You could jump off the end into the deep end .
I was born premature . I was always very small .
My left lung had collapsed when I was born .
And I &apos;ve always had buoyancy problems .
So water was something that scared me to begin with .
But I would go in on occasion .
A camp counselor fortunately came over and separated us .
From that point onward I was terrified of swimming .
That is something that I did not get over .
But there is a happy ending to this story .
And I would like to share my art .
So , moving onward .
Swimming , first principles .
First principles , this is very important .
So the clock started ticking .
I tried kickboards .
Hand paddles , everything .
Even did lessons with Olympians -- nothing helped .
That set me on the road to examining biomechanics .
The first is , forget about kicking . Very counterintuitive .
So it turns out that propulsion isn &apos;t really the problem .
The problem is hydrodynamics .
And you do that by maintaining a horizontal body position .
So let &apos;s look at some examples . This is Terry .
And so his entire body really is underwater .
The arm is extended below the head .
Here is an example of the stroke .
You can see this is the left extension .
Then you see his left leg .
Not their fault , honestly .
And I &apos;ll get to implicit versus explicit in a moment .
And that will get you very far .
Languages . Material versus method .
Six months later I had the chance to go to Japan .
So my parents encouraged me to do it . I left .
I arrived in Tokyo . Amazing .
But I said , &quot; Please rape me at eight a.m. &quot;
You &apos;ve never seen a more confused Japanese woman .
I walked in to school .
Asked him what this said .
And so it came to me in waves .
There had been something lost in translation .
The Japanese classes were not Japanese instruction classes , per se .
And that &apos;s pretty much my response .
I tried everything . I went to Kinokuniya .
I tried every possible book , every possible CD .
Nothing worked until I found this .
And this became my Holy Grail , my Rosetta Stone .
You can also do this with grammar .
I came up with these six sentences after much experimentation .
We can talk about that if anyone in interested .
And now I love languages .
So ballroom dancing , implicit versus explicit -- very important .
I used to be much bigger , much more muscular .
And so I ended up walking like this .
Not very good for ballroom dancing .
The instructor says , &quot; You are participating . &quot;
Immediately : death sweat .
&quot; Okay , come on , grab me . &quot;
Gorgeous assistant instructor .
Everyone burst into laughter . I was humiliated .
So I bought a month &apos;s worth of classes .
So I had a very short deadline for a competition .
I interviewed these people because they all taught in Buenos Aires .
I found that longer steps were much more elegant .
Secondly , different types of pivots .
Thirdly , variation in tempo .
I want you to see part of what I practiced .
I &apos;m going to jump forward here .
His name is Gabriel Misse .
Alicia , in her own right , very famous .
That &apos;s just one benefit of that .
So then we broke it down .
This would be an example of one pivot .
This is a back step pivot .
There are many different types .
So fear is your friend . Fear is an indicator .
Sometimes it shows you what you shouldn &apos;t do .
Especially with fears you gained when you were a child .
Apply them to very big dreams .
I know nothing . I &apos;m a beginner .
Thank you very much .
Bill Gross : A solar energy system that tracks the sun
There was gas rationing in 1973 .
The energy crisis was in full bore .
That got me very excited .
So , I started this company called Solar Devices .
But they didn &apos;t believe me .
And my first year at Caltech , I continued the business .
First , the coursework at Caltech .
So what about making energy ?
Maybe we could make energy .
I tried to figure out -- maybe solar &apos;s become attractive .
So , that &apos;s a breakthrough .
I &apos;ll be very short on genetic algorithms .
And I &apos;ll show you what we came up with .
Traditionally , concentrators look like this .
Those shapes are parabolas .
And this is the shape that evolved .
Solar cells collect light for four and a half hours though .
We needed to beat solar cells .
So we took a look at another idea .
But , his refinements were incredible .
Those were major breakthroughs .
Another type of engine is the hot air engine .
Put a flame under it , the piston moves up .
That &apos;s a heat engine .
We applied the genetic algorithm .
We got the results from that for the optimal engine .
Let me show you what it looks like in real life .
So this is the engine .
The exact converse is also true .
So now you put the two things together .
Thank you .
It doesn &apos;t really care .
and you also get hot water .
The hot water &apos;s optional .
This is how we would envision a residential application .
It &apos;s a really good combination of those two factors .
This is the map of the United States .
And of course , look at Africa .
It just makes economic sense .
Right now , solar paybacks are between 30 and 50 years .
Basically , oil is solar energy concentrate .
Thank you very much , you &apos;ve been a great audience .
Marc Pachter : The art of the interview
And that &apos;s what it &apos;s about .
So , how do we do that ?
Now , I had two preconditions .
One was that they be American .
Sixties , seventies , eighties and nineties .
And why did I do that ?
Well , for one thing , we &apos;re a youth-obsessed culture .
That &apos;s the one advantage that older people have .
There are many kinds of interviews . We know them .
Fair enough .
But I wanted interviews that were different .
By the way , this was always done in public .
This was not an oral history program .
I didn &apos;t know it coming into it .
And he had never appeared in public since that point .
But then I began to think of other things .
Who makes a great interview in this context ?
It was about their energy .
It &apos;s energy that creates extraordinary interviews and extraordinary lives .
I &apos;m convinced of it .
These were people through their 90s .
And I said , &quot; Yeah . Apparently I did . &quot;
The worst interview I ever did : William L. Shirer .
Didn &apos;t matter . &quot; Whatever .
Awful .
I never would ever agree to interview a modest person .
There &apos;s an extraordinary woman named Clare Boothe Luce .
She did so much . She was a playwright .
She did an extraordinary play called &quot; The Women . &quot;
She was a congresswoman when there weren &apos;t very many congresswomen .
So she and I had a delightful conversation .
It was all part of Clare Boothe Luce &apos;s look .
She was in a great evening gown .
And she stonewalled me . It was unbelievable .
When we were alone , I was her audience .
Now I &apos;m her competitor for the audience .
Just withering in her contempt .
And I said , &quot; I &apos;m learning . &quot;
Again , a remarkable person .
And she was in horrible pain .
We all knew that .
She stayed in her room .
Everybody came . The butler passed around canapes .
The usual sort of thing .
Was yours unhappy ? &quot;
And I asked him one question .
I said , &quot; Did Jefferson ever disappoint you ? &quot;
Dumas Malone was from Mississippi originally .
This was to Agnes de Mille .
An amazing woman .
She said , &quot; Come to my apartment . &quot;
She lived in New York .
She wasn &apos;t about to make up for this occasion .
She wasn &apos;t unhappy about this . She was resigned .
She agreed .
She came on . Of course she was wheelchaired on .
Half of her body was stricken , the other half not .
It was an amazing privilege to do this series .
Thank you very much .
Elyn Saks : A tale of mental illness -- from the inside
So I &apos;m a woman with chronic schizophrenia .
I &apos;ve spent hundreds of days in psychiatric hospitals .
For a week or more , I had barely eaten .
My face looked and felt like a mask .
The air was fetid , the room a shambles .
&apos;Thank you for coming , Steve .
Crumbling world , word , voice .
Tell the clocks to stop .
&apos;Gravity is pulling me down .
Fortunately , I did not actually enact that grave prognosis .
Thank you .
He &apos;s definitely the star of my show .
Let &apos;s start with the definition of schizophrenia .
Schizophrenia is a brain disease .
Delusions and hallucinations are hallmarks of the illness .
Imagine having a nightmare while you &apos;re awake .
The schizophrenic mind is not split , but shattered .
This person is likely to have some form of schizophrenia .
&apos;Memos are visitations , &apos; I informed them .
&apos;They make certain points . The point is on your head .
&apos;Come to the Florida sunshine bush .
I shrugged and followed them .
&apos;We &apos;ve got to case the joint .
This episode led to my first hospitalization in America .
I had two earlier in England .
This incident resulted in my involuntary hospitalization .
I never struck anyone .
I never harmed anyone . I never made any direct threats .
There &apos;s nothing benign about it .
They &apos;re different from me and you .
They wouldn &apos;t experience restraints as we would . &quot;
My motto was the less medicine , the less defective .
All around me I sensed evil beings poised with daggers .
The mission is not yet complete .
&apos;Head explosions and people trying to kill .
I think you need to be in the hospital .
You &apos;re offering to put me in hospitals ?
Hospitals are bad , they &apos;re mad , they &apos;re sad .
&quot; &apos; I give life and I take it away .
So let me share some final thoughts .
Also , we must stop criminalizing mental illness .
The poet Rainer Maria Rilke was offered psychoanalysis .
So would I take the pill ? In an instant .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you . You &apos;re very kind .
Thank you .
Liz Coleman : A call to reinvent liberal arts education
The story begins in the late &apos; 90s .
They were trying to figure out how to rebuild their universities .
Expertise has for sure had its moments .
But the price of its dominance is enormous .
We have even managed to make the study of literature arcane .
What kind of a world should we be making ?
What kind of a world can we be making ? &quot;
Meanwhile , the values and voices of democracy are silent .
And that was only the beginning .
We are playing with fire .
So the conversation began at Bennington .
Enhancing the public good becomes a primary objective .
When the design emerged it was surprisingly simple and straightforward .
They would assume the commanding role of traditional disciplines .
Design , the art of organizing the world of things .
But so does the importance of content .
This discovery is transforming .
Ideology , zealotry , unsubstantiated opinions simply won &apos;t do .
This is a political education , to be sure .
But it is a politics of principle , not of partisanship .
So the challenge for Bennington is to do it .
The center will embody and sustain this new educational commitment .
Think of it as a kind of secular church .
The words on the card describe what will happen inside .
So we are doing our job .
We actually do it all the time .
That is where you come in .
President Obama and his team simply cannot do it alone .
So what do you do when you feel overwhelmed ?
Well , you have two things .
You have a mind . And you have other people .
Start with those , and change the world .
Onyx Ashanti : This is beatjazz
Text : BeatJazz .
Accelerometers on each hand read hand position .
The color of the lights indicates which sound I am playing .
a button , two guitar picks and lots of hot glue .
The heads-up display is a smartphone that displays system parameters .
Why ?
And &quot; BeatJazzers &quot; become as common as D.J. &apos; s .
But mostly ...
to MAKE the future rather than wait for it .
Jane Fonda : Life &apos;s third act
Think about that .
That &apos;s the metaphor , the old metaphor .
Age as pathology .
How do we live it successfully ?
What is the appropriate new metaphor for aging ?
Age not at all as pathology ; age as potential .
And guess what ?
This potential is not for the lucky few .
We tend to see commonalities more than differences .
Some of the studies even say we &apos;re happier .
This is not what I expected , trust me .
I come from a long line of depressives .
And I got scared .
I thought , oh my gosh .
I &apos;m going to become a crotchety old lady .
I have such a powerful feeling of well-being .
I don &apos;t want to romanticize aging .
Some of it is a matter of luck .
Some of it , obviously , is genetic .
One third of it , in fact , is genetic .
And there isn &apos;t much we can do about that .
Myself included .
And here &apos;s an example of what I mean .
It &apos;s a terrible disease . It &apos;s fatal .
It wastes the body , but the mind remains intact .
As I slowly lost my speech , I gained my voice .
As I diminished , I grew .
Perhaps our parents suffered from depression .
Perhaps we still suffer from a psychic pain , a wound .
And so we can feel unfinished .
How was I supposed to live it ?
What was I supposed to accomplish in this final act ?
Who were my grandparents ?
How did they treat my parents ?
These kinds of things .
It wasn &apos;t your fault ; you &apos;re just fine .
You &apos;re able to free yourself from your past .
You can work to change your relationship to your past .
It &apos;s like resetting a thermostat .
It helps us become what we might have been .
Women start off whole , don &apos;t we ?
We have agency .
We are the subjects of our own lives .
Older women are the largest demographic in the world .
Thank you very much .
Kartick Satyanarayan : How we rescued the &quot; dancing &quot; bears &quot;
We went about getting evidence of what was going on .
And this is footage from a hidden camera in a button .
And we went in , pretending to be buyers .
Sadly , the family of Qalandars depended on this bear .
The couple are barely 18 years old .
And what they were doing to the bears was really appalling .
It was unacceptable .
The mother bears are usually killed .
The cubs , which are taken , are separated .
Their teeth are basically bashed out with a metal rod .
And we were so unsure that this would work .
He has a telephone booth .
This is Sadua who came and surrendered his bear .
Then there was no looking back at all for us .
We gave cycle rickshaws .
We set up carpet-weaving units , vocational training for the women .
Education . The kids never went to school .
They only had Islamic education , very little of it .
So , we sponsor 600 children education programs today .
We were able to ensure brighter futures for these people .
Of course we also had to get the bears in .
This is what happens to the bears when they come in .
And this is what we turn them into .
We have a veterinary facility in our rescue centers .
So , basically in 2002 there were 1,200 dancing bears .
We rescued over 550 dancing bears .
And the people can hold their heads up high .
And there will be no more removing of these bears .
Marla Spivak : Why bees are disappearing
They &apos;re out there because they need to eat .
Now this business of hand pollination is actually not that uncommon .
Tomato growers often pollinate their tomato flowers with a hand-held vibrator .
Now this one &apos;s the tomato tickler .
I got drawn into the honeybee world completely by a fluke .
I had never thought about insects living in complex societies .
It was like the best of science fiction come true .
And I was permanently hooked .
Now this society has no central authority .
Nobody &apos;s in charge .
So bees have social healthcare .
We &apos;ve found that propolis is a natural disinfectant .
It &apos;s a natural antibiotic .
Humans have known about the power of propolis since biblical times .
So what &apos;s going on ?
We stopped planting cover crops .
Clover and alfalfa are highly nutritious food plants for bees .
And we started growing larger and larger crop monocultures .
And then there &apos;s pesticides .
This small bee is holding up a large mirror .
How much is it going to take to contaminate humans ?
You &apos;ve probably heard about it .
This is a new class of insecticides .
Public enemy number one for bees is this thing .
It &apos;s called varroa destructor .
It &apos;s aptly named .
Let me put this all together for you .
But what if I lived in a food desert ?
And it &apos;s not just our honeybees .
These bees are providing backup for our honeybees .
They &apos;re providing the pollination insurance alongside our honeybees .
We need all of our bees .
So what are we going to do ?
It turns out , it &apos;s hopeful . It &apos;s hopeful .
Plant them in a pot on your doorstep .
Set aside farmland .
And we need to diversify our farms .
On behalf of the bees , thank you .
Thank you . Just a quick question .
What &apos;s your hope / depression level on this ?
Maria Spivak : Yeah .
About 20 years ago , we were at a 15-percent loss .
So it &apos;s getting precarious .
We &apos;re kind of at a tipping point .
We can &apos;t really afford to lose that many more .
Thank you .
Tom Wujec : 3 ways the brain creates meaning
And the consensus was : it really worked .
The processing , of course , begins with the eyes .
We &apos;re only going to talk about three of them .
So the first one is called the ventral stream .
It &apos;s on this side of the brain .
It &apos;s the &quot; what &quot; detector .
A second part of the brain is called the dorsal stream .
You &apos;d be activating the dorsal stream if you did that .
And it &apos;s the part that feels .
It &apos;s the selective logic .
Now we &apos;ve augmented this and spatialized this information .
And so we can compare and contrast the big ideas .
So the act of engaging and creating interactive imagery enriches meaning .
It activates a different part of the brain .
So the point of this is what ?
The lessons for us are three-fold .
So the low-tech version looks like this .
This is a time-lapse view of it .
You &apos;ll be able to figure that out .
No Powerpoint is used in two days .
And this is our great unveiling for today .
So making images meaningful has three components .
The first again , is making ideas clear by visualizing them .
Secondly , making them interactive .
And then thirdly , making them persistent .
Janet Echelman : Taking imagination seriously
This story is about taking imagination seriously .
I was an unlikely person to be doing this .
I never studied sculpture , engineering or architecture .
The deadline for the show arrived -- my paints didn &apos;t .
I had to do something .
This fishing village was famous for sculpture .
So I tried bronze casting .
But to make large forms was too heavy and expensive .
My first satisfying sculpture was made in collaboration with these fishermen .
It &apos;s a self-portrait titled &quot; Wide Hips . &quot;
We hoisted them on poles to photograph .
I was mesmerized .
So we raised this 45,000-pound steel ring .
So we had to create one .
This intersection had been bland and anonymous .
Now it had a sense of place .
I walked underneath it for the first time .
My life was not going to be the same .
Its shape was too complex now .
So we had to create it .
My artistic horizons continue to grow .
I &apos;ll leave you with this story .
I got a call from a friend in Phoenix .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
Shimon Steinberg : Natural pest control ... using bugs !
That &apos;s a magnifier times 10 .
Yeah , times 10 .
Just open it .
So this phenomenon of natural control exists literally everywhere .
Here , in front of this building , I &apos;m sure .
Just have a look at the plants .
What is a pest ?
What damage &#91; does &#93; it actually inflict on the plant ?
Let &apos;s have a look at that .
And then you see what kind of damage it can inflict .
But here comes nature that provides us with a good spider .
By the way , they are hungry always .
And there is another example : aphids .
By the way , it &apos;s springtime now in Israel .
Females giving rise to females giving rise to other females .
No males at all .
Parthenogenesis , &#91; as it &#93; was so called .
And they are very happy with that , apparently .
Here we can see the damage .
And here comes the salvation through this parasitic wasp .
Here we are not talking about a predator .
By the way , the aphid tries to escape .
This is all natural . This is all natural .
This is not fiction , nothing at all .
Again , in your backyard , in your backyard .
But this is the end result .
This is the end result : Mummies -- M-U-M-M-Y .
The birth is almost complete .
And this is of course not the end of it .
But this is a nice , slender , very bad pest .
If you can see this , sweet peppers .
This is not just an exotic , ornamental sweet pepper .
And again , in action .
So this is a very positive situation , by the way .
Everything is just fine under these circumstances .
What we do is actually this .
Many different parts .
There are no GMOs -- Genetically Modified Organisms -- whatsoever .
And that &apos;s what we get , in fact .
You see under a microscope .
And this is the whole bunch of predatory mites .
You see this ampoule . You see this one .
I have one gram of those predatory mites .
So this is what I call amplification of the phenomenon .
And no , we do not disrupt the balance .
That &apos;s the whole idea .
And what is the impact ?
So the impact is very strong .
Why good bugs ?
It &apos;s the same , and it can happen very quickly .
It hardly happens .
And thirdly , public demand .
Because , you see , this is the reality .
Have a look at the gap .
I think it &apos;s times 100 or something like that .
Twenty-five billion .
So there is a huge gap to bridge .
So actually , how can we do it ?
And this gap really narrows .
Step by step , it does narrow .
Thank you .
Carl Safina : The oil spill &apos;s unseen culprits , victims
This is the ocean as I used to know it .
First , just a little bit about me .
It &apos;s like you dipped a marble in water .
Carbon dioxide level has gone up and up and up .
We &apos;re warming the climate .
So this really matters .
And they can handle water .
They can handle a hurricane that comes and goes .
When the water goes down , they know what to do .
They don &apos;t have another thing they can do .
You see a lot of oil on the ocean .
You see a lot of oil on the shoreline .
Parts of the ocean there look just absolutely apocalyptic .
It &apos;s really messy .
They have thousands and thousands of plastic bags .
Meanwhile , there are still people trying to use the beach .
You see people who are really shell-shocked .
They are very hardworking people .
They &apos;re finding that their world is really collapsing .
These are the things that you can see .
What &apos;s going on underwater ?
Well , some people say there are oil plumes .
Some people say there are not oil plumes .
I created a little oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
I think it &apos;s being hidden on purpose .
But you can see it .
Okay .
We heard that bacteria eat oil ?
So do sea turtles .
Turtles eat it . It gets in the gills of fish .
These guys have to swim around through it .
That guide &apos;s entire calendar year is canceled bookings .
He has no bookings left .
Everybody wanted their deposit back . Everybody is fleeing .
That &apos;s the story of thousands of people .
Their numbers have never recovered .
It &apos;s going to take longer for some things .
These tuna swim the entire ocean .
But these are really high-performance athletic animals .
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;ll affect the adults .
And they populate much larger areas .
Down on the lower left there are Ruddy Turnstones and Sanderlings .
The economic effects go at least nationally in many ways .
The biological effects are certainly hemispheric .
Mainly what they &apos;re doing is booms and dispersants .
The booms are absolutely not made for open water .
They get near shore . Look at these two boats .
That one on the right is called Fishing Fool .
The dispersants make the oil go right under the booms .
The booms are only about 13 inches in diameter .
So it &apos;s just absolutely crazy .
Here are shrimp boats employed .
Here they are working .
All they &apos;re doing is stirring it .
It &apos;s just ridiculous .
Everybody &apos;s trying to protect the bird colonies there .
These birds make a living by diving into the water .
It &apos;s really , really important that we express our compassion .
I refuse to acknowledge this as anything like an accident .
I think that this is the result of gross negligence .
Not just B.P.
B.P. operated very sloppily and very recklessly because they could .
Now there are things that we can do in the future .
And you &apos;d have some idea of what to do .
That &apos;s certainly one of the things we need to do .
That &apos;s what it would really mean to be conservative .
I think there are signs of hope .
We seem to be waking up a little bit .
So it &apos;s a continued fight .
It &apos;s a historic moment right now .
The first offshore wells were called whales .
The first offshore drills were called harpoons .
We emptied the ocean of the whales at that time .
Now are we stuck with this ?
Who says it &apos;s too expensive ?
People who sell us fossil fuels .
Energy is always a moral issue .
It &apos;s an issue that is moral right now .
It &apos;s a matter of right and wrong .
Thank you very much .
Martin Jacques : Understanding the rise of China
The world is changing with really remarkable speed .
Goldman Sachs projected 2027 .
The post-crisis projection is 2020 .
That &apos;s just a decade away .
China is going to change the world in two fundamental respects .
This is an illusion .
It will remain in very fundamental respects very different .
How do we try to understand what China is ?
We can &apos;t .
And you can see it against the boundaries of modern China .
It &apos;s never been the case .
And what does it mean ?
Well , I think it has all sorts of profound implications .
I &apos;ll give you two quick ones .
It divided , and it &apos;s remained divided ever since .
The second is maybe more prosaic , which is Hong Kong .
You may remember what the Chinese constitutional proposition was .
One country , two systems .
&quot; Window dressing .
We were wrong . Why were we wrong ?
Think of German unification , 1990 .
What happened ?
Well , basically the East was swallowed by the West .
One nation , one system .
That is the nation-state mentality .
It doesn &apos;t work .
The Chinese don &apos;t feel like that .
China is only multiracial really at the margins .
So the question is , why ?
It &apos;s had no serious rivals .
Know that China believes in the market and the state .
But this is combined with an extremely strong and ubiquitous state .
The state is everywhere in China .
and was finally completed in the seventh century A.D.
It &apos;s kind of arrogant .
And secondly , it &apos;s ignorant .
We refuse to really address the issue of difference .
But it &apos;s not .
I mean , take the question of East Asia .
Now the largest economic region in the world .
And there are two consequences of this .
Europe was not at the final negotiating table .
When did that last happen ?
I would wager it was probably about 200 years ago .
And that is what is going to happen in the future .
Take the 19th century , for example .
But this , alas , is no longer true .
It doesn &apos;t even look like a railway station .
Okay , so how would I like to finish ?
That &apos;s what Europe and North America represented .
I think they &apos;re playing golf .
Christ , the Chinese even invented golf .
Welcome to the future . Thank you .
Philip K. Howard : Four ways to fix a broken legal system
Well , law is also a powerful driver of human behavior .
And our guide was a local science teacher .
The stories started pouring out .
You have to go in a school bus . &quot;
This is a doctor , whose life is caring for people .
People no longer feel free to act on their best judgment .
So , what do we do about it ?
And of course the hindsight bias is perfect .
Absolutely vital .
Is it working ?
What does the macro-data show us ?
It &apos;s very hard to measure because there are mixed motives .
Let &apos;s go to schools .
Well it turns out the schools are literally drowning in law .
And what happens when the teacher tries to assert order ?
They &apos;re threatened with a legal claim .
And how has this system of law worked for government ?
It doesn &apos;t seem to be working very well does it ?
Neither in Sacramento nor in Washington .
That means all the boys are going to be ADD .
I mean it &apos;s just absolutely a formula for failure .
My favorite , though , are all the warning labels .
They &apos;ll think it was some kind of aphrodisiac .
My favorite warning was one on a five-inch fishing lure .
Life is complicated enough without legal fear .
And so the state can come in .
It actually changes the way people think .
Then you &apos;ve wasted 200 billion dollars in unnecessary tests .
Self-consciousness is the enemy of accomplishment .
So , how do you restore trust ?
States with extensive tort reform still suffer all these pathologies .
It turns out that freedom actually has a formal structure .
We &apos;ve forgotten that second part .
So , what &apos;s needed now is to rebuild these boundaries .
And it &apos;s especially important to rebuild them for lawsuits .
So , how do we rebuild it ?
Life is too complex for ...
Life is too complex for a software program .
And so here is the fourth proposition .
The constitution is only 16 pages long .
Worked pretty well for 200 years .
And how do you make it simple ?
We have to rehumanize the law .
That person doesn &apos;t exist today .
This is the hardest hurdle .
Case dismissed without prejudice or refiling in small claims court .
You can &apos;t run a society by the lowest common denominator .
So , what &apos;s needed is a basic shift in philosophy .
We &apos;ve been taught that authority is the enemy of freedom .
Law is a human institution ; responsibility is a human institution .
That &apos;s what &apos;s happened to America . Look around .
Alastair Parvin : Architecture for the people by the people
That &apos;s our kind of working presumption .
And I think it &apos;s wrong , actually .
The economy ran out of jobs .
And a couple of things struck me about this .
One , don &apos;t listen to career advisers .
And a good place to start is your own paycheck .
That &apos;s about 36,000 , 37,000 dollars .
So here &apos;s a story .
They &apos;re far too small . They get congested between classes .
There &apos;s bullying . We can &apos;t control them .
Instead , get rid of the school bell .
And a lot of people can &apos;t even afford them .
How will we sell design services ?
And that &apos;s a good thing .
And that began with open-source software .
And that &apos;s where 3D printing gets really , really interesting .
And they &apos;re distributing massively really complex manufacturing capabilities .
That really is an industrial revolution .
And we were fascinated by what that might mean for architecture .
And it goes together without any bolts .
It uses wedge and peg connections .
They don &apos;t need any traditional construction skills .
Of course , the house is never finished .
One of them is that it &apos;s always incredibly sociable .
People get confused between construction work and having fun .
Don &apos;t reinvent the wheel every time .
They &apos;re self-made cities in one form or another .
A kind of Wikipedia for stuff ?
How much would that change the rules ?
And I think the technology &apos;s on our side .
Thank you very much .
David Keith : A critical look at geoengineering against climate change
The fact is -- uh-uh .
And we &apos;ve accomplished close to zip .
This is the growth rate of CO2 in the atmosphere .
But in fact , they &apos;re growing faster .
I don &apos;t want to depress you too much .
Cheap meaning a few percent of GDP .
Instead , we spend our time talking .
But , of course , the natural world , polar bears .
They will completely lose .
And there &apos;s no adaption .
So this problem is absolutely soluble .
And I know for certain that that will work .
And the reason is , it &apos;s been done .
The result of that was pretty dramatic .
There &apos;s no big mystery about it .
But it clearly cools down .
And one other thing : it &apos;s fast .
So you can &apos;t step on the brakes very quickly .
But if you do this , it &apos;s quick .
And there are times you might like to do something quick .
Another thing you might wonder about is , does it work ?
And the answer seems to be yes .
This topic is also old .
I &apos;m not saying we shouldn &apos;t cut emissions .
We should , but it made exactly this point .
So , in a sense , there &apos;s not much new .
The one new thing is this essay .
He said roughly what &apos;s been said before .
One of the problems with sulfates is they fall out quickly .
I &apos;ll tell you very quickly how the effect works .
And so you see a net force away from the sun .
That &apos;s called the photophoretic force .
I &apos;m sure there will be other problems that arise .
The one thing about this is it gives us extraordinary leverage .
Now , suppose that space aliens arrived .
And the box has two knobs .
One knob is the knob for controlling global temperature .
Maybe another knob is a knob for controlling CO2 concentrations .
You might imagine that we would fight wars over that box .
We have no global governance .
And different people will have different places they want it set .
But we &apos;re building that box .
Even when they &apos;re doing it for other reasons .
They develop science that makes it easier and easier to do .
We need a broader debate .
It &apos;s very cheap . We have a lot of leverage .
And that calculation isn &apos;t much in dispute .
I don &apos;t think anybody takes that seriously .
But here &apos;s a case which is harder to reject .
That &apos;s an absolutely possible scenario .
But there is a problem with that view .
This is what economists call a moral hazard .
Should we do serious research on this topic ?
Should we have a national research program that looks at this ?
A very small amount of money would get us some .
But I have a lot of reservations .
Another thing is , maybe we need a treaty .
A treaty that decides who gets to do this .
And I think it really summarizes where we are here .
Thank you very much .
Nellie McKay : &quot; Clonie &quot;
Dan Dennett : Cute , sexy , sweet , funny
Exactly . Exactly . And it is a strange inversion .
But Darwin shows that it &apos;s just false .
Guys go for girls like this because they are sexy .
We adore babies because they &apos;re so cute .
There &apos;s nothing intrinsically sweet about honey .
Sweetness was born with the wiring which evolved .
And there &apos;s nothing intrinsically sexy about these young ladies .
That &apos;s all there is to it .
It wasn &apos;t designed for chocolate cake .
Chocolate cake is a supernormal stimulus .
It was a hyperstimulus for them , and they loved it .
There &apos;s lots of supernormal stimuli for sexiness .
So nature works on many levels here .
This is the strange inversion .
Thank you very much .
How will we be remembered in 200 years ?
It happened 225 years ago .
It was actually a terrible disaster for Princeton .
It &apos;s the child that &apos;s remembered .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re going through at this time .
That will blow away a lot of the opposition .
So , let &apos;s leave that aside .
And I &apos;m interested in searching for life in the universe .
It &apos;s not only cold , but very dry .
So the asteroids we don &apos;t have much hope for .
And that makes it extraordinarily interesting as a place to explore .
That &apos;s something we don &apos;t yet know how to do .
There are plans to do it , but it &apos;s hard .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to talk about .
What would they need in order to grow on the surface ?
So they would have to have something like a reptilian skin .
And the regular astronomers were scornful about this .
So there &apos;s no point in looking . &quot;
There is something called pit lamping .
You take -- that &apos;s a Canadian expression .
So these creatures will be bright against the cold surroundings .
It &apos;s extremely hard to move from one planet to another .
I call these creatures sunflowers .
They look like , maybe like sunflowers .
So they can collect sunlight from a big area .
That &apos;s another wonderful opportunity that &apos;s opening .
That would be a fun thing to do .
Thank you .
Seyi Oyesola : A hospital tour in Nigeria
I graduated high school in Cleveland , Ohio , 1975 .
Finished university education , got a medical degree , 1986 .
Very interesting .
How many people do you think are on that taxi ?
Believe it or not , some of us do survive .
Some of us do survive malaria ; we do survive AIDS .
That &apos;s sterilizing equipment in Nigeria .
You remember all that oil ?
You can say some of this is education .
And that &apos;s my specialty , right ?
Anesthesiology and critical care -- look at that bag .
And believe me , these are current pictures .
So , these are the problems .
There we go -- we &apos;re going on a mission .
Health is wealth , in the words of Hans Rosling .
You get wealthier faster if you are healthy first .
So , here we are , mission . Big trouble .
Open-heart surgery in Nigeria -- big trouble .
That &apos;s Mike , Mike comes out from Mississippi .
Does he look like he &apos;s happy ?
Yes , let &apos;s just go work this thing out .
We get a lot of donated equipment .
So what we going to do now ?
I mean , what &apos;s an X-ray viewing box ? Please .
Well , nowadays everything &apos;s on PAX anyway .
And we were doing open-heart surgery .
You still get people who believe in it and they came .
At 67 percent oxygen saturation , the normal is about 97 .
The oxygen tanks didn &apos;t quite work right .
But how many did we do the first one ? 12 .
We did 12 open-heart surgical patients successfully .
This is what I mean about appropriate technology .
Have you seen one of those before ?
No ? Yes ? Doesn &apos;t matter , it worked .
Thank you . Sustainable Solutions -- this was my first company .
And that &apos;s a perfect example of one .
That &apos;s exactly how the outlets are designed .
Is it dental surgery you want ? General surgery you want ?
Decide which instruments , stock it up with consumables .
And currently we &apos;re working on oxygen -- oxygen delivery on-site .
The technology for oxygen delivery is not new .
This is what makes it so special .
This picture was taken last year .
These are members of my graduating class , 1986 .
Thank you .
Dan Pallotta : The way we think about charity is dead wrong
I want to talk about social innovation and social entrepreneurship .
I happen to have triplets .
They &apos;re little . They &apos;re five years old .
Sometimes I tell people I have triplets .
They say , &quot; Really ? How many ? &quot;
Here &apos;s a picture of the kids .
That &apos;s Sage and Annalisa and Rider .
Now , I also happen to be gay .
The real social innovation I want to talk about involves charity .
How do you monetize that ?
And that &apos;s where the nonprofit sector and philanthropy come in .
Philanthropy is the market for love .
But it doesn &apos;t seem to be working .
We have two rulebooks .
We &apos;ll put you on the cover of Wired magazine .
Not necessarily . They might be smart .
The second area of discrimination is advertising and marketing .
But I don &apos;t want my donations spent on advertising .
I want it go to the needy . &quot;
But they have to be asked .
The fourth area is time .
And the last area is profit itself .
All of the scale goes to Coca-Cola and Burger King .
So why do we think this way ?
Making all this money will get you sent directly to Hell .
What were they to do about this ?
Well , charity became their answer .
There are a lot of problems with this question .
I &apos;m going to just focus on two .
2002 was our most successful year ever .
And then we went out of business , suddenly and traumatically .
Our sponsor went and tried the events on their own .
The overhead went up .
This is what happens when we confuse morality with frugality .
Here &apos;s how all of this impacts the big picture .
That &apos;s about 300 billion dollars a year .
Now we &apos;re talking scale .
Now we &apos;re talking the potential for real change .
Dan Pallotta : Thank you very much . Thank you .
Thank you .
Jamil Abu-Wardeh : The Axis of Evil Middle East Comedy Tour
This talk is about righting writing wrongs .
No , the sound &apos;s not faulty -- righting writing wrongs .
I think humor is a great way to celebrate our differences .
We need to take our responsibilities seriously , but not ourselves .
And wherever they went , they killed .
Now , I had friends in the U.S.
who had started a successful new tribe .
I had four phases to this plan .
Now , fast forward two years , to early 2007 .
Here &apos;s how the dots connected .
Our new French CEO believed in the power of positive PR ...
and ideas du bon marche .
Let &apos;s just say &quot; value for money . &quot;
This is all true .
Stay away from bolitics in the Middle East .
Now , were the Axis successful ?
We had millions see them on TV and on TV news .
Anywhere you go .
So everywhere we went , we auditioned amateurs .
We filmed that process and aired a documentary .
I called it &quot; Three Guys and Wonho . &quot;
It really is his name .
20 years ago , no one had heard of it .
Look at it now .
These comics are now going to the New York festival .
Enough .
We have a positive story to tell and image to sell .
Three : Is the Middle Eastern character being played by one ?
Clearly , there are wrongs that need to be righted .
We &apos;ve started in our region .
Thank you .
Saki Mafundikwa : Ingenuity and elegance in ancient African alphabets
And I called it the Zimbabwe Institute of Vigital Arts .
Some logos designed by my students .
So it &apos;s a special-interest writing system .
It &apos;s called Sankofa .
All the paths lead to and from God .
Shü-mom is a writing system .
It &apos;s a syllabary . It &apos;s not exactly an alphabet .
It &apos;s a syllabary and reads from left to right .
It is also time that designers in Africa stop looking outside .
Thank you very much .
Mark Roth : Suspended animation is within our grasp
So then there &apos;s also my favorite example of suspended animation .
This is Sea-Monkeys .
Those of you with children , you know about them .
Well , I wasn &apos;t so interested in the swimming .
She got cranky and just went home .
So , these are miracles , right ?
These are truly miraculous things that happen .
And it &apos;s true . It &apos;s true .
That &apos;s over 50 percent .
And here &apos;s the thing that should freak you out .
We can see it in a variety of different organisms .
One of the creatures we see it in is a fish .
But , of course , she was also extremely cold .
It &apos;s a really good thing .
You know ?
And so , we went looking for such things .
And this was a period of time when we failed tremendously .
Well , we had a lot of them .
The researchers had to suit up just to enter it .
It &apos;s filled with this toxic gas , hydrogen sulfide .
Now , hydrogen sulfide is curiously present in us .
We make it ourselves .
The highest concentration is in our brains .
It &apos;s an extraordinarily toxic thing .
It &apos;s really going to be OK . &quot;
I mean , who knows ?
It stopped moving .
It appeared dead .
Its oxygen consumption rate fell by tenfold .
And here &apos;s the really important point .
I told you hydrogen sulfide is in us .
Now , this was cosmic .
Well this was really cool .
I founded a company called Ikaria with others &apos; help .
And also the wonderful scientists and businesspeople at Ikaria .
A miracle ?
Thank you very much .
Rufus Griscom + Alisa Volkman : Let &apos;s talk parenting taboos
AV : We did .
AV : That spawned a dating site .
That &apos;s a subject that we want to dive into .
These are our three sons .
I remember vividly , sitting there in the hospital .
AV : We , or I ?
RG : I &apos;m sorry .
Misuse of the pronoun .
And I was there with my arms open .
So I was bracing myself for the moment .
And you can see , our eyes were glistening .
And it was also , of course , surreal .
And this was all quite remarkable .
And so we &apos;ve done something here that is heretical .
We have charted our love for our child over time .
This , as you know , is an act of heresy .
You &apos;re not allowed to chart love .
You love , or you don &apos;t love .
So I actually threw a pop quiz here onto Rufus .
RG : Uh oh .
RG : The far left . AV : No !
RG : Cruel .
AV : Nothing more to be said .
I &apos;ll move on to taboo number two .
I enjoyed being pregnant . I loved it .
I felt incredibly connected to the community around me .
That continued into the the hospital . It was really exhilarating .
I was shower with gifts and flowers and visitors .
So Alisa &apos;s experience is not isolated .
So your 58 percent of mothers surveyed report feelings of loneliness .
This is actually the last little image we have of him .
And it was obviously a very difficult time -- really painful .
So it was a very difficult time .
And I think , miscarriage is an invisible loss .
There &apos;s not really a lot of community support around it .
There &apos;s really no ceremony , rituals , or rites .
This chart is comprised of four completely independent studies .
We were despondent .
We said , something is wrong here .
There &apos;s something missing from these studies .
It can &apos;t possibly be that bad .
As you get older , you become more stable .
So I &apos;m not going to go .
RG : And so in effect , we trade average happiness .
There &apos;s another factor in our case .
Everybody knows , you should absolutely not work with your spouse .
It &apos;s a bad idea . Don &apos;t do it . &quot;
And we obviously went forward . We did .
And so how about that average baseline of happiness ?
Can we move that up a little bit ?
RG + AV : Thank you .
Steve Jurvetson : Model rocketry
Baking soda and vinegar .
And the boys get bigger , and the rockets get bigger .
These rockets use experimental motors like nitrous oxide .
They use solid propellant most frequently .
It &apos;s a strange kind of love .
Mavericks : we had to call it Rocket Mavericks .
Here was a drag race .
Sometimes they just explode before your eyes or come down supersonic .
Voices : Woohoo ! Yeah . Nice .
They &apos;re yelling deploy . Voices : Oh shit .
Voices : It &apos;s going ballistic . Oh shit .
SJ : And I &apos;ll just be quiet .
Voices : No .
Up , up , up .
Things often go wrong .
It &apos;s a cadence you can &apos;t quite imagine .
Thank you .
Sebastian Wernicke : Lies , damned lies and statistics
And that &apos;s a huge amount of data .
Could you create the ultimate TEDTalk ?
Oh , well .
How should you deliver your talk ?
Now , while ...
I &apos;ll give you three examples .
You &apos;ll all stay with me .
It &apos;s perfectly fine .
Now , let &apos;s go to the visuals .
The most obvious visual thing on stage is the speaker .
Slides are okay , though you might consider going for props .
Color plays a very important role .
And I call this tool the TEDPad .
So , download it and have fun with it .
Now I hope you enjoy the session .
Freeman Hrabowski : 4 pillars of college success in science
And so I begin with a story about my childhood .
We all are products of our childhood experiences .
And there was a designated kicker every day .
And they said his name was Dr. Martin Luther King .
And they said , &quot; Absolutely not . &quot;
And we had a rough go of it .
You make me go to this . You make me listen .
And they thought about it all night .
And they came into my room the next morning .
They had not slept .
And they decided to do it .
I wanted a better education .
I did not want to have to have hand-me-down books .
And the real question is , what lessons did we learn ?
And it has been for 50 years an experiment .
We produced great artists . Beckett is our muse .
A lot of our students get into theater .
It &apos;s great work .
That &apos;s a big deal . It really is .
Quite frankly , you &apos;re talking about Americans .
Well a part of it , of course , is K-12 .
We need to strengthen K-12 .
I know . I know . I know .
We need to find ways of making it happen .
Number one : high expectations .
Smart simply means you &apos;re ready to learn .
Every foundation makes the difference in the next level .
He retook the course .
He now works at Harvard .
Nice story . Give him a hand for that too .
Secondly , it &apos;s not about test scores only .
But she had a factor that was very important .
She never missed a day of school , K-12 .
There was fire in that belly .
Big hand for her . Big hand for her .
And so high expectations , very important .
Secondly , the idea of building community among the students .
Students are not taught to work in groups .
So building community among those students , very important .
And so our students are working in labs regularly .
They had food they had packed out .
They knew they were working on AIDS research .
They were looking at this amazing protein design .
Let me get the staff to help me out . &quot;
It was that connecting .
Give him a big hand for that .
And so we redesigned chemistry , we redesigned physics .
Because so many students are bored in class .
Do you know that ?
They need to be engaged .
It &apos;s called academic innovation .
And what does all of that mean ?
Aristotle said , &quot; Excellence is never an accident .
It represents the wisest option among many alternatives . &quot;
And then he said something that gives me goosebumps .
Thank you all very much .
Thomas Thwaites : How I built a toaster -- from scratch
They look like TV cameras , monitors , annoying radio mics .
But he didn &apos;t have Wikipedia .
I had maybe nine months .
So I thought , okay , I &apos;ll start with five .
So , starting with steel : how do you make steel ?
And Professor Cilliers was very kind and talked me through it .
Can I come up and get some iron ? &quot;
Unfortunately , when I got there -- emerges Ray .
But after some nagging , I got him to do that .
But instead of a bellows , I had a leaf blower .
I dragged out this stuff , and it wasn &apos;t iron .
That &apos;s me getting mica .
Plastic is the defining feature of cheap electrical goods .
BP obviously has a bit more on their mind now .
So I looked at other ways of making plastic .
So this is attempting to make potato starch plastic .
And for a while that was looking really good .
But this is it .
So there &apos;s a picture of my toaster .
That &apos;s it without the case on .
And there it is on the shelves .
Thanks .
I &apos;m told you did plug it in once .
TT : Yeah , I did plug it in .
So the wires were uninsulated .
But I considered it a partial success , to be honest .
Thomas Thwaites . TT : Thanks .
Jane Chen : A warm embrace that saves lives
Please close your eyes , and open your hands .
Now open your eyes .
What about a life ?
What you see here is a premature baby .
Four million of these babies die annually .
That is the primary function of an incubator .
I &apos;ve seen this firsthand over and over again .
So , this is what we came up with .
What you see here looks nothing like an incubator .
It looks like a small sleeping bag for a baby .
You can open it up completely . It &apos;s waterproof .
But the magic is in this pouch of wax .
This is a phase-change material .
But the longer-term social impact is a reduction in population growth .
In designing this we followed a few basic principles .
It &apos;s a pretty accurate description .
Today , we will see 250,000 individual new computer viruses .
We will see 30,000 new infected websites .
People normally write that down , by the way .
Today &apos;s cybercriminal , what do they look like ?
But actually today , cybercriminals are wonderfully professional and organized .
In fact , they have product adverts .
Check out this one I found .
Turns out that &apos;s not cool .
But it goes further .
So let me show you what malicious code looks like today .
Now , there are many ways you can get infected .
You will have come in contact with some of them .
Now there are many ways you can get infected .
I want to show you a couple of my favorites .
This is a little USB key .
Well , you could try looking really cute .
Awww .
Or , in my case , awkward and pathetic .
So let &apos;s have a look here on my victim computer .
Malware is very boring otherwise .
We can access your documents , your data .
You can turn on the webcam .
That can be very embarrassing .
Let me show you how most malware is now distributed today .
This is a script .
It &apos;s code which will be interpreted on the webpage .
Notice that after a couple of seconds , I get redirected .
It creates some very serious alerts .
Oh look , a child porn proxy server .
We really should clean that up .
Now I liked it better when viruses were free .
So anyway , let me change pace a little bit .
So let &apos;s take this a little further .
There are a few other interesting pieces the cybercriminals had uploaded .
And our cybercriminals had done the same thing .
So here &apos;s a photo which resolves to St. Petersburg .
We then deploy the incredibly advanced hacking tool .
We used Google .
One of these was more stereotypical for me .
A little more searching , and here &apos;s our cybercriminal .
Imagine , these are hardened cybercriminals sharing information scarcely .
They were working on the third floor .
But this is where our investigation starts to slow down .
The cybercriminals have locked down their profiles quite well .
Now you &apos;re probably wondering what happened to these guys .
Let me come back to that in just a minute .
So I ran a little scan .
Okay ? So you can see a list of wireless networks .
TEDAttendees , HyattLB . Where do you think I &apos;m staying ?
Sophos _ Visitors , SANSEMEA , companies I work with .
Loganwifi , that &apos;s in Boston . HiltonLondon .
CIASurveillanceVan .
This is how geeks party .
So let &apos;s make this a little bit more interesting .
Let &apos;s talk about you .
Things get more interesting .
And two percent of you have a tendency to extreme profanity .
Would someone be able to abuse it ? &quot;
Get a secure password .
Find these resources . Apply them .
Thank you .
Raul Midon : &quot; Peace on Earth &quot;
This song kind of came out of all of that .
It &apos;s called &quot; Peace on Earth . &quot;
Which brought us to this .
So think of this as a choose-your-own-adventure of an album .
Let &apos;s take a closer look .
Let &apos;s look at one example here .
This is then joined by the sound of sweeping violins .
Thank you .
Marco Tempest : The electric rise and fall of Nikola Tesla
So let the story begin .
Lightning lit the sky , and a baby was born .
His name was Nikola , Nikola Tesla .
Now the baby grew into a very smart guy .
Let me show you .
Tesla , what is 236 multiplied by 501 ?
Nikola Tesla : The result is 118,236 .
Tree . Chair . Girl .
They were hallucinations , which vanished the moment he touched them .
Probably a form of synesthesia .
But it was something he later turned to his advantage .
NT : I needed no models , drawings or experiments .
Only then do I construct it .
MT : His great idea was alternating current .
To sell his idea , he became a showman .
It is the magic of science .
He even photographed the bones of the human body .
But Tesla &apos;s success didn &apos;t last .
NT : I had bigger ideas .
Illuminating the city was only the beginning .
NT : They wouldn &apos;t give me the money .
NT : Yes , that was a big mistake .
MT : Tesla &apos;s career as an inventor never recovered .
He became a recluse .
His legacy is with us still .
Tesla &apos;s insight was profound .
MT : Tesla thought he had the answer .
We are still asking the question .
Thank you .
Michelle Obama : A plea for education
Can you believe that ?
The special relationship between the United States and the U.K.
There is nothing in my story that would land me here .
I was raised on the South Side of Chicago .
That &apos;s the real part of Chicago .
And I was the product of a working-class community .
Neither of them attended university .
He was grateful for what he had .
I know , how romantic .
But when we met , Barack was a community organizer .
And I talked about this throughout the entire campaign .
We know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like .
We all know .
You &apos;re going to write the next chapter in history .
And that &apos;s why getting a good education is so important .
And that &apos;s important to keep in mind .
Part of that health includes an outstanding education .
They allowed for no obstacles .
As the sign said back there , &quot; without limitations . &quot;
And having done so , these women moved many obstacles .
Please remember that .
I never did it .
I loved getting As .
I liked being smart .
I thought being smart was cooler than anything in the world .
You too can pave the way .
You now have control over your own destiny .
And it won &apos;t be easy -- that &apos;s for sure .
But you have everything you need .
My husband works in this big office .
They call it the Oval Office .
Because we are counting on you .
Because the world is big .
And it &apos;s full of challenges .
Chrystia Freeland : The rise of the new global super-rich
So here &apos;s the most important economic fact of our time .
The 0.1 percent in the U.S.
today account for more than eight percent of the national income .
They are where the One Percent was 30 years ago .
Just think about it .
But I think there &apos;s something else going on .
In practice , getting rid of crony capitalism is incredibly difficult .
In and of themselves , these aren &apos;t too mysterious .
Just think about it .
The latest poster boy for this phenomenon is David Karp .
We have superstar technologists .
We have superstar bankers .
We have superstar lawyers and superstar architects .
There are superstar cooks and superstar farmers .
Let &apos;s start with technology .
I love the Internet . I love my mobile devices .
I &apos;m even more of a fan of globalization .
Think of your dishwasher or your t-shirt .
So what &apos;s not to like ?
Well , a few things .
And that &apos;s no mere hypothetical example .
Think about Amazon , Apple , Google , Starbucks .
Again , this is no mere hypothetical .
As income inequality increases , social mobility decreases .
Let &apos;s start with technology .
When &apos;s the last time you used a travel agent ?
The same is true of globalization .
What worries me more is a different nightmare scenario .
We created the modern welfare state .
We created public education .
We created public health care .
We created public pensions .
We created unions .
We need a new New Deal .
Anna Mracek Dietrich : A plane you can drive
What is it about flying cars ?
We &apos;ve wanted to do this for about a hundred years .
And the result is the Terrafugia Transition .
You take off and land at a local airport .
And it works .
within the light sport aircraft category .
And at 110 lbs . , driving .
Now let &apos;s see it in action .
And that &apos;s the automated wing-folding mechanism .
That &apos;s real time .
Radio : It actually flew . Yes .
Radio 2 : That was gorgeous .
Radio : What did you think of that ?
That was beautiful from up here , I tell you .
The Transition will cost in line with other small airplanes .
Here &apos;s why .
And mobility to your destination is clearly solved .
Just fold up the wings and keep going .
It also continues to be a fabulous adventure .
Devdutt Pattanaik : East vs. West -- the myths that mystify
&quot; How come ? &quot; said Kartikeya .
&apos;My world &apos; is subjective .
It &apos;s emotional . It &apos;s personal .
It &apos;s perceptions , thoughts , feelings , dreams .
It is the belief system that we carry .
It &apos;s the myth that we live in .
Different people see things differently -- different viewpoints .
Yours is faith .
Yours is illogical .
This is the root of the clash of civilizations .
It took place , once , in 326 B.C.
This river lends itself to India &apos;s name .
India . Indus .
We don &apos;t know who he was .
Alexander asked , &quot; What are you doing ? &quot;
and the gymnosophist answered , &quot; I &apos;m experiencing nothingness . &quot;
Then the gymnosophist asked , &quot; What are you doing ? &quot;
and Alexander said , &quot; I am conquering the world . &quot;
And they both laughed .
Each one thought that the other was a fool .
The gymnosophist said , &quot; Why is he conquering the world ?
It &apos;s pointless . &quot;
What a waste of a life . &quot;
That &apos;s what he heard .
&quot; What should you not be ?
But these are not the stories that the gymnosophist heard .
He heard a very different story .
Bharat also conquered the world .
that &apos;s what I thought until I came here . &quot;
This was the mythology of the gymnosophist .
But they were not two characters on two different adventures .
They were two lifetimes of the same hero .
When the Ramayana ends the Mahabharata begins .
When Ram dies , Krishna is born .
When Krishna dies , eventually he will be back as Ram .
But you don &apos;t cross it once .
You go to and fro endlessly .
It was called the Vaitarani .
You go again and again and again .
And what do you do at the end of 10 days ?
You dunk it in the river .
Because it has to end .
And next year , she will come back .
&quot; Groundhog Day . &quot;
Two different mythologies .
Which is right ?
One linear , one cyclical .
One believes this is the one and only life .
The other believes this is one of many lives .
And so , the denominator of Alexander &apos;s life was one .
The denominator of the gymnosophist &apos;s life was infinity .
Who knows ?
And that brings us to the mythology of business .
Take a look .
And then look at business .
Standard business model : vision , mission , values , processes .
And if you comply , you will go to heaven .
But in India there is no &quot; the &quot; promised land .
It &apos;s always about taste .
It &apos;s always about my taste .
There is no orchestra conductor .
There is one performer standing there , and everybody follows .
And you can never replicate that performance twice .
It is not about documentation and contract .
It &apos;s about conversation and faith .
And people are okay with it .
And then globalization is taking place .
The demands of modern institutional thinking is coming in .
Which is rooted in one-life culture .
It is bound to happen .
I love mythology too much .
So , I had to teach it to myself .
And mythology does not pay , well , until now .
And I worked in the healthcare industry .
I even was a business consultant , doing strategies and tactics .
Example : Please tell us the process to invoice hospitals .
Step A. Step B. Step C. Mostly .
How do you parameterize &quot; mostly &quot; ?
I would give my viewpoints to people .
And he was dealing with diverse and dynamic markets .
He had an intuitive understanding of the mythic structure of India .
Sounds so simple .
But belief is not measurable .
You can &apos;t measure it . You can &apos;t manage it .
So , how do you construct belief ?
How do you enhance the sensitivity of people to Indian-ness .
And I will share one of the rituals with you .
You see it is based on the Hindu ritual of Darshan .
Hindus don &apos;t have the concept of commandments .
You want to see God .
And based on this , we created a ritual for leaders .
The customer is happy , because the customer is God .
And it has .
So , I will not answer the question .
You see , because both the paradigms are human constructions .
They are cultural creations , not natural phenomena .
Understand it .
And when you understand it you will discover something spectacular .
You will discover that within infinite myths lies the eternal truth .
Who sees it all ?
Varuna has but a thousand eyes .
Indra , a hundred .
You and I , only two .
Thank you . Namaste .
Renata Salecl : Our unhealthy obsession with choice
The sweet anxiety of choice .
Let me give you an example .
But what you are buying now is great . &quot;
Now , why were Manya &apos;s customers so irrational ?
Now , we rarely make really totally rational choices .
Choices are influenced by our unconscious , by our community .
Also we are choosing by looking at what others are choosing .
We &apos;re also guessing what is socially acceptable choice .
Now , choices are anxiety-provoking .
They are linked to risks , losses .
They are highly unpredictable .
And now , I need to choose a sperm donor . &quot;
I looked at this woman in shock .
&quot; Sperm donor ? What &apos;s the rush ? &quot;
Now , we think today that we can prevent these risks .
We have endless market analysis , projections of the future earnings .
Now , chance is actually becoming very traumatic .
Now , we delivered the conference in such a way .
We decoded our genome .
We know about our brains more than before .
Ignorance and denial are on the rise .
Now , what does that mean ?
And who would want to tax one &apos;s son ?
We are anxious that we are not good enough .
And there is an important message that I did learn .
It really prevented us to think about social change .
We can choose to have more wolves .
We can choose to change our environment to have more bees .
We can choose to have different rating agencies .
We have a possibility to make changes .
Thank you .
Kent Larson : Brilliant designs to fit more people in every city
You needed easy access to the fields .
Life was very small for most people .
That &apos;s where babies were born and people died .
Then , with industrialization , everything started to become centralized .
Production was centralized in assembly plants .
You had centralized energy production .
And then you had networks that developed .
You had separated functions , increasingly .
Imagine that .
Cities are places of celebration , personal expression .
Now there &apos;s some trends that will impact cities .
First of all , work is becoming distributed and mobile .
The office building is basically obsolete for doing private work .
And that &apos;s a very important trend to think about .
So this is my image of the city of the future .
In that it &apos;s a place for people , you know .
How can we have the good stuff without the bad ?
The 20 arrondissements of Paris are these little neighborhoods .
So we said , let &apos;s start with that neighborhood cell .
We think of it as a compact urban cell .
And he might be right .
This is even a more interesting solution in Seoul , Korea .
The Highline in Manhattan is very similar .
We actually did exactly the wrong thing in Boston .
You just spin and go directly in .
It &apos;s not really a problem .
You have nobody to make eye contact with .
We hope to have that built this fall .
Housing is another area where we can really improve .
Developers say , okay , we &apos;ll build little teeny apartments .
That &apos;s sort of a bogus concept .
That means twice as much parking , though .
You add shared use , and you can even go further .
We think these little wireless sensors are more effective .
We think we can also personalize sunlight .
That &apos;s sort of the ultimate personalization in some ways .
This can be combined with LED lighting as well .
We think workplaces should be shared .
This is Starbucks , you know .
We need shared spaces for interaction and collaboration .
We &apos;re not doing a very good job with that .
They &apos;re places for people .
Thank you .
Clay Shirky : How the Internet will transform government
Let &apos;s start here .
Can you spot the vegetable ?
This was a zero day . That &apos;s good .
And then two weeks ago yesterday , she posted this .
A post that read : &quot; Goodbye . &quot;
I really enjoyed doing this .
Thank you for reading . Goodbye . &quot;
You can guess what happened next , right ?
Except , of course , this morning .
Now , this isn &apos;t just a contemporaneous question .
What would this lead to ?
Well , obviously , it would lead to world peace .
World peace .
The telephone ?
You guessed it : world peace .
What they got exactly wrong was what happens next .
More media always means more arguing .
That &apos;s what happens when the media &apos;s space expands .
We are a pro-printing press society .
But the other thing they needed was speed .
The scientific revolution wasn &apos;t created by the printing press .
Well , predictions of world peace ? Check .
More arguing ? Gold star on that one .
I mean , YouTube is just a gold mine .
Better arguing ? That &apos;s the question .
All right . They look like org charts .
This is feudalism : one owner , many workers .
Now , that &apos;s fine for the commercial software industry .
The corporation owns the software .
The programmers come and go .
This is Linus Torvalds .
His point of view on this was very clear .
This is a tremendously complicated process .
It has two big differences with traditional version control systems .
This is cooperation without coordination .
This is the big change .
This is a graph of the Ruby community .
So , the law is also dependency-related .
So there &apos;s that as a site for source code management .
Right .
And it includes this very evocative screenshot .
The stuff in red is the stuff that got deleted .
The stuff in green is the stuff that got added .
Programmers take this capability for granted .
This , graphically , was the answer .
The bigger problem , of course , is power .
They are experimenting with openness .
So consider this .
We have them . We &apos;ve seen them . They work .
Can we use them ?
Can we apply the techniques that worked here to this ?
Thank you for listening .
Thank you . Thank you .
Esther Duflo : Social experiments to fight poverty
Maybe a sobering thought and something you all know about .
That &apos;s a Haiti earthquake every eight days .
So why is that ?
Well , here is a thought experiment for you .
Or maybe you turn to the past .
After all , we have spent billions of dollars on aid .
Maybe you look at the past and see .
Has it done any good ?
And , sadly , we don &apos;t know .
And worst of all , we will never know .
And the reason is that -- take Africa for example .
Africans have already got a lot of aid .
These are the blue bars .
And the GDP in Africa is not making much progress .
There &apos;s only one Africa .
So what do you do ?
Sometimes the patient gets better , sometimes the patient dies .
Is it the leeches ? Is it something else ?
We don &apos;t know .
So here are some other questions .
They &apos;re smaller questions , but they are not that small .
So you have your million .
In fact , that is the leading cause of under-five mortality .
Bed nets are very cheap .
&quot; Not so fast , &quot; say other people .
So , what do you do ?
How do you know ?
And a third question : Education .
But how do you do that ?
Do you hire teachers ? Do you build more schools ?
Do you provide school lunch ?
How do you know ?
So here is the thing .
But these three questions , I can answer them .
And I &apos;ll give you some examples with those three questions .
So I start with immunization .
Here &apos;s Udaipur District , Rajasthan . Beautiful .
That &apos;s bad , but there are places like that .
So you get these empty village subcenters and crowded hospitals .
So what is the problem ?
But maybe there is another problem as well .
It &apos;s going from intention to action .
Imagine you are a mother in Udaipur District , Rajasthan .
So these are simple ideas , but we didn &apos;t know .
So let &apos;s try them .
So the blue dots are selected randomly .
The white dots are comparisons , nothing changed .
Now , a kilo of lentils is tiny .
So what do we find ?
Well , beforehand , everything is the same .
That &apos;s the beauty of randomization .
That &apos;s full immunization .
That &apos;s not bad , that &apos;s a good improvement .
Add the lentils and you reach to 38 percent .
So here you &apos;ve got your answer .
We cannot keep giving lentils to people . &quot;
How about bed nets ?
So the answer hinges on the answer to three simple questions .
We can know the answer to this question .
We can just run an experiment .
And now we can see what happens .
So , how about the purchasing ?
Second thing is , how about the use ?
If they get it for free , they use it .
If they have to pay for it , they use it .
How about the long term ?
Maybe we need to give them a little bit more credit .
But what politicians need is a range of options .
So suppose your goal is to get kids into school .
So what &apos;s the best ?
Consider for example transporting goods .
So why shouldn &apos;t we do the same with social policy ?
Suppose you have 100 dollars to spend on various interventions .
And here are the most surprising results .
And they are good , scientific , robust answers .
So let &apos;s go back to Haiti for a moment .
And yet it doesn &apos;t happen .
So , why is that ?
And the problem of poverty is not like that .
There &apos;s no silver bullet .
You cannot helicopter people out of poverty .
And that &apos;s very frustrating .
But look what we just did today .
Here &apos;s an example of how this can be powerful .
Deworming .
Worms have a little bit of a problem grabbing the headlines .
They are not beautiful and don &apos;t kill anybody .
So this evidence is powerful .
It can prompt action .
So we should get started now .
It &apos;s not going to be easy .
It &apos;s a very slow process .
And sometimes what works somewhere doesn &apos;t work elsewhere .
It &apos;s a slow , deliberative process of discovery .
I believe we can and I hope we will .
Thank you .
Parag Khanna : Mapping the future of countries
Do we live in a borderless world ?
Before you answer that , have a look at this map .
That &apos;s probably more than at any time in centuries .
Now , many of you will object .
For you this would be a more appropriate map .
You could call it TEDistan .
How do we distribute ourselves around the world ?
Let &apos;s start with the world of 1945 .
1945 there were just 100 countries in the world .
Over 50 new countries were born .
You can see that Africa has been fragmented .
India , Pakistan , Bangladesh , South East Asian nations created .
Then came the end of the Cold War .
Today we have 200 countries in the world .
The entire planet is covered by sovereign , independent nation-states .
And as you know , China is the most populous .
And they share a lengthy land border .
And only 30 million people are in its eastern areas .
Why do they call it that ?
China isn &apos;t conquering Mongolia .
It &apos;s buying it .
Colonies were once conquered . Today countries are bought .
So let &apos;s apply this principle to Siberia .
But who is it going to feed ?
That &apos;s larger than the entire population of Russia .
They set up their own bazaars and medical clinics .
That &apos;s what I call globalization Chinese style .
But hold on . This map is 700 years old .
Again , globalization Chinese style .
Well it &apos;s China &apos;s turn again .
It starts with the global hubs .
These are the filters and funnels of global capital .
Then there is trade .
Another pillar of this strategy is diplomacy .
China has signed military agreements with many countries in the region .
Another pillar of the strategy , like Russia , is demographic .
Chinese pride is resurgent in the region as a result .
Singapore , for example , used to ban Chinese language education .
Now it encourages it .
If you add it all up what do you get ?
All of this is happening without firing a shot .
What lines on the map should we focus on ?
Let &apos;s start with Iraq .
The reason is Kurdistan .
But what are they guarding ?
Is it really a border on the map ?
No . It &apos;s the pipelines .
I don &apos;t believe we should .
Now remember Kurdistan is landlocked .
It has no choice but to behave .
And therefore it has to have amicable relations with them .
Now lets look at a perennial conflict in the region .
That is , of course , in Palestine .
Today donors are spending billions of dollars on this .
This is the Hejaz Railway .
The Hejaz Railway ran from Istanbul to Medina via Damascus .
But today the Hejaz Railway lies in tatters , ruins .
These countries &apos; borders originate from Stalin &apos;s decrees .
He purposely did not want these countries to make sense .
Why is it all he &apos;s talking about is oil ? &quot;
Before it was , how do we control their oil ?
Now it &apos;s their oil for their own purposes .
A great deal of them .
Just take Azerbaijan .
It was more considered South Siberia during the Soviet Union .
The Great Game connotes dominance of one over the other .
Silk road connotes independence and mutual trust .
And that is , of course , Europe .
In fact most of that happened on just one day .
In 2004 , 15 new countries joined the E.U.
Now let &apos;s look at Turkey and the Caucasus .
I mentioned Azerbaijan before .
Of course , we can &apos;t forget Africa .
Now let &apos;s go up to the Arctic Circle .
Who will win ? Canada ? Russia ? The United States ?
Actually Greenland .
So Denmark is about to get a whole lot smaller .
What is the lesson from all of this ?
Geopolitics is a very unsentimental discipline .
Now we fear changes on the map .
Thank you .
Elizabeth Lesser : Take &quot; the Other &quot; to lunch
I was the freak of the family .
So , looking for answers , I went to Catholic mass .
I tagged along with my neighbors .
I read Sartre and Socrates .
Now , see this strange , underwater , coral reef-looking thing ?
They &apos;ve made me a proud I-don &apos;t-know-it-all .
She &apos;s worried .
They &apos;re supposedly tongue-in-cheek , but they &apos;re actually dangerous .
Who wrote that ?
And then they morph into violent extremism .
This is why I &apos;m launching a new initiative .
Or someone from the other side of the abortion conflict .
Or maybe your brother-in-law who doesn &apos;t believe in global warming .
Now on paper , she passed my smoking ears test .
Be curious ; be conversational ; be real .
And listen .
From there , we dove in .
What issues deeply concern you ?
I think it has relevance to any problem between people anywhere .
&quot; What ? &quot; she wanted to know .
Well , she was shocked .
Neither of us had tried to change the other .
Who should you invite to lunch ?
And what might happen at your lunch ?
Probably not .
Because ubuntu work is slow , and it &apos;s difficult .
It &apos;s two people dropping the pretense of being know-it-alls .
I &apos;ll meet you there . &quot;
Alwar Balasubramaniam : Art of substance and absence
How did you do ? &quot;
And then school also started supporting me .
So I just switched on in the train , loudly .
You know , like just adjacent to me .
I think you should study in a school of art .
You just quit school and come there . &quot;
But it is just a kind of trace of that time .
And that fascinated me , to explore that territory .
So this is called &quot; Self In Progress . &quot;
It &apos;s just a trace of being in this body .
It &apos;s almost like a 3D photograph .
So it &apos;s almost like fossils for the future .
This is called &quot; Dawn to Dawn . &quot;
So it took about 24 hours to get this line .
So like let &apos;s say even a simple act .
Can you just raise the hand ?
Why the cow was crossing the road , you know .
The answer can be so different if Potter said it .
He would say , &quot; For the greater good . &quot;
It just all depends on one &apos;s perception .
And context , what is really context ?
Because I always think meaning doesn &apos;t really exist .
It &apos;s just created by the mind .
This is how we &apos;ve been taught in school .
It &apos;s just captured through from the lamp .
This is called &quot; Limit Out . &quot;
This is an exact negative .
And we &apos;re just pulling the wall off the gallery .
Again , &quot; Inward Out . &quot;
It &apos;s a full-figure cast from myself .
It &apos;s about eight inches deep .
Is there any way to capture the thought into visual art ?
I couldn &apos;t find it .
It &apos;s called Odonil .
This is the work I made out of that material .
Will you help me to make this sculpture ? &quot;
They never wrote back to me .
They said , &quot; Of course .
Please come for the show . &quot;
And they did .
And this work is in the Devi Art Foundation in Delhi .
It &apos;s just all about questioning the preconceptions .
It &apos;s in the same gallery or in the same museum .
And I was like , &quot; What do you mean ? &quot;
&quot; Light makes dark and now evaporating self .
Can you make something from nothing as a sculptor ? &quot;
So , I did this work for her .
It &apos;s called &quot; Emerging Angel . &quot;
So , the same sculpture after a few days .
This is after 15 / 20 days .
This gave me a greater faith .
So what you see now is called &quot; Shadow Foreshadow . &quot;
When it &apos;s bounced on the moon , we see it .
The same thing in the darkroom .
If we sculpt this , this has two reference points .
The skin of this is also representing this .
And skin at the other end also represents the floor .
I did this as an experiment of casting the shadow .
So this is a corrugated box and its shadow .
So that produced a shadow .
Then I thought , okay , let me sculpt that .
Then , again , that becomes an object .
Again , throwing light , then the third one .
You can see the detail .
This is called &quot; Gravity . &quot;
This is called &quot; Kaayam . &quot;
Detail .
Because when we see someone walks , we see the footprint .
Thank you .
Bandi Mbubi : Demand a fair trade cell phone
I came to the U.K. 21 years ago as an asylum-seeker .
I was 21 .
Can you imagine your world without it ?
It is a symbol of an interconnected world .
It is an anticorrosive heat conductor .
It stores energy in our mobile phones , Playstations and laptops .
It is used in aerospace and medical equipment as alloys .
It is so powerful that we only need tiny amounts .
It would be great if the story ended there .
But don &apos;t throw away your phones yet .
The Congo consistently scores dreadfully in global health and poverty rankings .
Coltan is easily controlled by armed groups .
It has truly revolutionized the way we communicate on the planet .
It has allowed momentous political change to take place .
So we are faced with a paradox .
It is time to be asking questions about technology .
Where does it come from ?
Who makes it ?
And for what ?
Recent U.K. legislation could be used in the same way .
But we &apos;re not there yet .
I missed my family and the friends I left behind .
Communication was extremely difficult .
We demand fair trade food and fair trade clothes .
It is time to demand fair trade phones .
This is an idea worth spreading . Thank you .
Kathryn Schulz : Don &apos;t regret regret
So that &apos;s Johnny Depp , of course .
And that &apos;s Johnny Depp &apos;s shoulder .
And that &apos;s Johnny Depp &apos;s famous shoulder tattoo .
And now his shoulder says , &quot; Wino forever . &quot;
That didn &apos;t happen to me .
Which is a great place to do it because nobody cares .
I do that hourly .
I learned a lesson from it .
And okay , I wouldn &apos;t change it .
until I tell you who said it .
It &apos;s called a lobotomy .
So let &apos;s start off by defining some terms .
What is regret ?
So in other words , regret requires two things .
And second of all , it requires imagination .
Why ?
&quot; I should have taken the bridge and not the tunnel .
I should have gone through that yellow light . &quot;
These are the classic conditions that create regret .
This session today is about behavioral economics .
Here &apos;s what the answers turn out to look like .
We wish we &apos;d gotten more of it .
We wish we &apos;d chosen to study a different topic .
They account for less than three percent of our total regrets .
We all know the short answer .
It feels terrible . Regret feels awful .
So the first consistent component of regret is basically denial .
And the thought was , &quot; Make it go away ! &quot;
This is an unbelievably primitive emotional response .
We &apos;re not trying to solve the problem .
We &apos;re not trying to understand how the problem came about .
We just want it to vanish .
The second characteristic component of regret is a sense of bewilderment .
What was I thinking ? &quot;
We can &apos;t identify with that part .
We don &apos;t understand that part .
Make it go away . Make it go away . &quot;
In point of fact , no insurance covers acts of idiocy .
This is obviously an incredibly painful experience .
Sometimes instead of Control-Z , we actually have zero control .
Text : Relpy to all .
Or you can just have an incredibly embarrassing day at work .
Or you can have your last day at work .
So how are we supposed to live with this ?
That is Johnny Depp and me and our seven million friends .
And that &apos;s just regret about tattoos .
We are all in this together .
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s the case though .
And do you guys just want to see it ?
All right .
Because it &apos;s actually not that hideous .
It &apos;s just that I don &apos;t like how it looks .
And as I said earlier , I &apos;m a perfectionist .
But I &apos;ll let you see it anyway .
This is my tattoo .
I can guess what some of you are thinking .
So let me reassure you about something .
Well it did .
The point isn &apos;t to live without any regrets .
The point is to not hate ourselves for having them .
Regret doesn &apos;t remind us that we did badly .
It reminds us that we know we can do better .
Thank you .
Jeff Han : The radical promise of the multi-touch interface
You know , like that .
Now , multi-touch sensing isn &apos;t completely new .
It &apos;s completely intuitive ; there &apos;s no instruction manual .
The interface just kind of disappears .
Google should have something like this in their lobby .
This is a photographer &apos;s light box application .
I can pan , zoom and rotate it effortlessly .
Again , the interface just disappears here .
Now , of course , I can bring up a keyboard .
And I can bring that around , put that up there .
That leads to bad things , like RSI .
This keyboard is probably actually the really wrong direction to go .
So -- again , isn &apos;t this great ?
Audience : Where &apos;s your lab ?
It &apos;s pressure-sensitive , you can notice .
It &apos;s just so much fun playing around with too .
And when I close it , it becomes a character .
And you notice what it does .
Thank you .
James Nachtwey : Moving photos of extreme drug-resistant TB
I believed the photographers and so did millions of other Americans .
Their images fuelled resistance to the war and to racism .
Thank you very much .
Toby Eccles : Invest in social change
Forty-three .
Seven .
It &apos;s got to be worth something , right ?
Now , of course , we care about the social value .
The idea is called the social impact bond .
So we have to raise some money .
We use the contract to raise money from socially motivated investors .
Socially motivated investors : there &apos;s an interesting idea , right ?
And here &apos;s the opportunity .
So we get paid for crimes saved .
So everyone wins here , right ?
Society wins : fewer crimes , fewer victims .
Now , the offenders , they also benefit .
So children in the state care tend to do very badly .
The state is not a great parent .
Investors have put in 3.1 million pounds .
That program started last month .
So what &apos;s caused this excitement ?
Why is this so different for people ?
The second piece it brings is rigor .
And we learn and adapt the program accordingly .
The last element is partnership .
And this creates a structure through which they can combine .
So where does this leave us ?
Thank you .
Alisa Miller : The news about the news
How does the news shape the way we see the world ?
And here &apos;s how news shapes what Americans see .
There was massive flooding in Indonesia .
The U.S. accounted for 79 percent of total news coverage .
What was that story ? The death of Anna Nicole Smith .
So , why don &apos;t we hear more about the world ?
The reality is that covering Britney is cheaper .
And what about the web ?
The most popular news sites don &apos;t do much better .
I know we can do better .
And can we afford not to ? Thank you .
Frederic Kaplan : How to build an information time machine
This is an image of the planet Earth .
This is pretty amazing .
i &apos;m not really sure when this picture was taken .
Is that possible ?
Can I reconstruct social networks of the past ?
Can I make a Facebook of the Middle Ages ?
So , can I build time machines ?
This is what I call the information mushroom .
Vertically , you have the time .
and horizontally , the amount of digital information available .
How do we do that ?
One way is digitization .
I can digitize all these .
I can extract information from these .
So , it might not be enough .
So , I can do what historians do .
I can extrapolate .
This is what we call , in computer science , simulation .
I &apos;m extrapolating .
We need very large archives , and we need excellent specialists .
You have every change that was made in the city .
This is all there .
And these are administrative documents .
They are well structured in many cases .
Actually probably 10 billion events can be extracted from this archive .
And this giant information system can be searched in many ways .
You have to put it in a larger European context .
&quot; How much will it cost ? &quot;
&quot; What are the chance of encountering pirates ? &quot;
So how can we detect and correct these inconsistencies ?
How can we represent that form of uncertainty ?
Maybe there &apos;s not a single map .
Maybe there are several maps .
Again , Venice is extraordinary for that .
It &apos;s really a question of scale .
I thank you very much .
Shyam Sankar : The rise of human-computer cooperation
I &apos;d like to tell you about two games of chess .
At first , the results were predictable .
The surprise came at the end . Who won ?
It &apos;s become the dominant school of thought in computer science .
Note that word &quot; cooperate . &quot;
Of course , in other ways , humans are so limited .
We &apos;re terrible at scale , computation and volume .
You can start by designing the human into the process .
What Kasparov calls process is a byproduct of friction .
The better the process , the less the friction .
And minimizing friction turns out to be the decisive variable .
Or take another example : big data .
These are necessary but insufficient questions .
Again , we start by designing the human into the process .
Osama bin Laden was not caught by artificial intelligence .
These records were human resource forms .
The foreign fighters filled them out as they joined the organization .
They answered questions like , &quot; Who recruited you ? &quot;
In that last question , a surprising insight was revealed .
Thank you .
Ian Goldin : Navigating our global future
The future , as we know it , is very unpredictable .
The best minds in the best institutions generally get it wrong .
And it &apos;s clearly in the area of finance .
Globalization is getting more complex .
And this change is getting more rapid .
The future will be more unpredictable .
It did this a thousand years ago .
The last 40 years have been extraordinary times .
Life expectancy has gone up by about 25 years .
It took from the Stone Age to achieve that .
But there is an underbelly .
There are two Achilles &apos; heels of globalization .
What happens in one place very quickly affects everything else .
This is a systemic risk , systemic shock .
It will continue .
So what will this do ?
It will create huge opportunities in technology .
Miniaturization as well .
This is a dust mite on a nanoreplica .
We can develop any part of the body .
Fantastic potential for regenerative medicine .
But the question is , &quot; Who will have it ? &quot;
So forget about retirements if you &apos;re young .
Of course , migration will become even more important .
This would imply a massive leap in migration .
And then , the systemic risks .
Small levels of stock push resilience into other people &apos;s responsibility .
It &apos;s going to require innovation .
How do we begin to weave these tapestries together ?
How do we think about complex systems in new ways ?
It is vital that we do so .
Thank you .
Paul Piff : Does money make you mean ?
They got two times as much money .
So we &apos;ve provided subtitles .
Rich Player : How many 500s did you have ?
Poor Player : Just one .
Rich Player : Are you serious . Poor Player : Yeah .
Rich Player : I have three .
I don &apos;t know why they gave me so much .
We had a bowl of pretzels positioned off to the side .
It &apos;s on the bottom right corner there .
That allowed us to watch participants &apos; consummatory behavior .
So we &apos;re just tracking how many pretzels participants eat .
Rich Player : Are those pretzels a trick ?
Poor Player : I don &apos;t know .
Rich Player : I love pretzels .
Rich Player : I have money for everything .
Poor Player : How much is that ?
Rich Player : You owe me 24 dollars .
You &apos;re going to lose all your money soon .
I &apos;ll buy it . I have so much money .
I have so much money , it takes me forever .
I &apos;m pretty much untouchable at this point .
And we just monitor how much people give .
I know it sounds like I &apos;m making a joke .
They &apos;re in studies . This is for them .
And we just monitored how much candy participants took .
So here &apos;s an example of how we did it .
He approaches as the red truck successfully stops .
It &apos;s not difficult to discern that there are differences .
We &apos;re at unprecedented levels of economic inequality .
Even people at the top experience these outcomes .
So what do we do ?
Thank you .
Jean-Baptiste Michel : The mathematics of history
So it turns out that mathematics is a very powerful language .
But I don &apos;t think that &apos;s right .
I want to show you a couple of examples why .
That &apos;s a powerful historical force .
Now it &apos;s just the way it is .
Language changes over time , and it &apos;s a powerful force .
So Erez and I wanted to know more about that .
&quot; Today I walk . Yesterday I walked . &quot;
But some verbs are irregular .
&quot; Yesterday I thought . &quot;
So what kind of historical mechanism can produce that ?
What &apos;s the origin of this ?
And so that explains this pattern that we &apos;ve seen before .
Thank you very much .
Olafur Eliasson : Playing with space and light
In the studio we do a lot of experiments .
I would consider the studio more like a laboratory .
I have occasional meetings with scientists .
So just keep looking . Don &apos;t mind me .
I don &apos;t necessarily think the film is so interesting .
Who decides what reality is ?
This is the Tate Modern in London .
The show was , in a sense , about that .
And my idea was to make the space tangible .
So look at this . Look at the girl .
&quot; Oh ! That was my foot there ! &quot;
How do we reconfigure it ?
&quot; What does it matter ? &quot;
Is art about that ?
And the water flows through the city with time .
And if I vote it makes a difference .
If I take a stand , it makes a difference . &quot;
The difference between thinking and doing .
Iceland , lower right corner , my favorite place .
These kinds of experiments , they filter into architectural models .
These are ongoing experiments .
It &apos;s made out of ice .
It &apos;s quite simple and fundamental .
I &apos;ve walked a lot in the mountains in Iceland .
It doesn &apos;t really tell you what you &apos;re looking at .
The big mountains far away , they move less .
The small mountains in the foreground , they move more .
And your body somehow knows that .
So this means a waterfall is a way of measuring space .
It was also about giving the city a sense of dimension .
And why would we want to do that ?
Is there a sense of consequences ?
One could say this is about community , collectivity .
It &apos;s about being together .
How do we create public space ?
What does the word &quot; public &quot; mean today anyway ?
It &apos;s very much about this causality , consequences .
So what is between thinking and doing ?
Experience is about responsibility .
Having an experience is taking part in the world .
Taking part in the world is really about sharing responsibility .
That &apos;s all I have . Thank you very much .
I want to start on a slightly somber note .
Should it be a mastectomy ? Should it be a lumpectomy ?
With all the side effects ?
Or should it be a less aggressive form of treatment ?
And these were being pressed upon us by the doctors .
I think that is too simplistic .
Which got me thinking .
Now , why do you have to consume the tea ?
Why ? Because it makes a lot of sense .
Simultaneously , it needs to be calm .
Not agitated , calm . For which chamomile is very good .
And you know that .
Now , you &apos;re all going to consume the tea .
Anyone in the audience want to take a stab ?
Baba Shiv : Whoa !
Okay , that &apos;s cool .
Because we want these puzzles to be difficult .
Now , here &apos;s another example .
Anyone ? It &apos;s much more difficult .
Yeah , wow . Okay .
So , yeah , so this is again difficult .
Less effort , you &apos;re less persistent , and so on .
How do you know that ?
Well we have two objective measures .
You will spend less time compared to you .
Right ? Second , it is negative .
Remember , the deck was stacked against you .
In terms of the difficulty level of these puzzles .
And this can happen in the medical domain .
Right ? It can happen in the stock market .
Volatile stock market , getting negative feedback that &apos;s also immediate .
And the feedback in all these cases is concrete .
You were responsible for your decision .
So what do you do ?
You focus on the foregone option .
Now , I started off on the somber note .
I want to finish up on a more upbeat note .
Thank you .
Avi Rubin : All your devices can be hacked
Now medical devices have come a long way technologically .
You can see in 1926 the first pacemaker was invented .
And why do I say that ?
They launched many , many successful attacks .
Now , wireless and the Internet can improve health care greatly .
Okay , let me shift gears and show you another target .
The modern car is a sophisticated multi-computer device .
And what happens if somebody wanted to attack this ?
Now , they have two areas they can attack .
They actually carried out their attack in real life .
You might produce a lot of speeding tickets .
They were able to disable the brakes .
All of these were implemented successfully .
How would you steal a car in this model ?
You use the GPS in the car to locate it .
Surveillance was really interesting .
Am I scaring you yet ?
I &apos;ve got a few more of these interesting ones .
I &apos;ll show you two more . One is P25 radios .
It &apos;s more of a two-way radio .
Could you run a denial-of-service , because these are first responders ?
You see the difference ?
This is plain text . This is encrypted .
And what kind of things were people talking about ?
It was mostly law enforcement and criminal .
That one &apos;s pretty easy to fix .
Now , we &apos;ve all looked at smartphones upside down .
And so they had a simple setup .
Don &apos;t waste computer cycles .
It &apos;s the Supreme Court , right ?
So they ran the Pac-Man game .
What does this all mean ?
Thank you very much .
Sarah Kay : If I should have a daughter ...
Believe me , I &apos;ve tried .
That there &apos;ll be days like this .
You will put the wind in winsome , lose some .
You will put the star in starting over , and over .
Your voice is small , but don &apos;t ever stop singing .
Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you .
Thanks .
Thank you .
The only rule is don &apos;t think too hard .
Okay , ready ? Go .
Okay .
So here are three things I know to be true .
Why was the scarecrow invited to TED ?
Because he was out standing in his field .
I &apos;m sorry .
But there are plenty of things I have trouble understanding .
So I write poems to figure things out .
Spoken word poetry is the art of performance poetry .
And I was underdeveloped and over-excitable .
So I decided to give it a try .
And lightning struck .
I was hooked .
Now I can divide my spoken word journey into three steps .
And that was thanks to a girl in a hoodie .
When I was in high school I had created Project V.O.I.C.E.
But it turns out sometimes , poetry can be really scary .
So I came up with lists . Everyone can write lists .
And then someone else has something the complete opposite of yours .
And most people respond really well to this exercise .
I don &apos;t have anything interesting to say . &quot;
But I try to walk through life like this .
I write musicals ; I make short films alongside my poems .
But I teach spoken word poetry because it &apos;s accessible .
Plus , spoken word poetry allows for immediate connections .
Because step three never ends .
I think December 54th was probably supposed to be 24th .
I think that we all did .
So I &apos;d like to close with this poem .
And what was left of the city soon followed .
She says I have old eyes .
My knees still buckle every time I get on a stage .
My parents named me Sarah , which is a biblical name .
I start quickly becoming part of your past .
But in that instant , I get to share your present .
And you , you get to share mine .
And that is the greatest present of all .
These aren &apos;t the last words I &apos;ll share .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Miru Kim : My underground art explorations
I wanted to dissect it and look into its unseen layers .
Most people ignore them or are frightened of them .
The MTA will confiscate your camera . &quot;
I &apos;ll follow the rats . &quot;
Simply documenting these soon-to-be-demolished structures wasn &apos;t enough for me .
The nature had really reclaimed the whole complex .
The construction began in 1837 .
It lasted about five years .
It got abandoned when the new Croton Aqueducts opened in 1890 .
This is a tunnel underneath Riverside Park .
It was built in the 1930s by Robert Moses .
Walking in this tunnel is very peaceful .
This is the same tunnel .
This is a tunnel that &apos;s abandoned in Hell &apos;s Kitchen .
I was basically intruding in his living space .
It must have been a very unusual day for him .
This is underneath my alma mater , Columbia University .
This is the actual catacombs in Paris .
The first tunnels date back to 60 B.C.
It &apos;s very dangerous to get lost in there .
This is a German bunker .
This is the Tower of Saint Jacques .
It was built in the early 1500s .
It was not very comfortable .
This was probably the toughest place to explore .
I &apos;ve become more interested in capturing movement and texture .
And the 16mm black-and-white film gave a different feel to it .
And this is the first theater project I worked on .
This was taken inside an archaeological tunnel in the main temple .
I like doing more than just exploring these spaces .
Thank you .
Ben Kacyra : Ancient wonders captured in 3D
I &apos;d like to start with a short story .
Let me show you how it works .
The point is then recorded into a 3D visualization program .
All of this happens in seconds .
They were gone in an instant .
And unfortunately , there was no detailed documentation of these Buddhas .
We called the project CyArk , which stands for Cyber Archive .
These would be used for education , cultural tourism , etc .
This happens to be the cloud of points for Tikal .
And so this is not a video .
This is actual 3D points with two to three millimeter accuracy .
Let me close with another short story .
Last March , we received very sad news .
The Royal Tombs had been destroyed by suspected arson .
Our answer , of course , was yes .
Let me leave you with a final thought .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
So you have been digitally preserved in about four minutes .
I &apos;d like to thank the wizards here .
David .
Let &apos;s give them a hand .
Thank you .
New thinking on the climate crisis
Perhaps we should say the same thing about optimism .
How dare we be optimistic ?
Optimism is sometimes characterized as a belief , an intellectual posture .
And we have one .
Let me show you these slides here .
This is what &apos;s happened in the last 28 years .
To put it in perspective , 2005 was the previous record .
That puts a lot of pressure on Greenland .
They have exactly the same amount of carbon .
It &apos;s not because Venus is slightly closer to the Sun .
Here &apos;s the stratosphere : cooler .
CSI : Climate .
What is missing is a sense of urgency .
This is the winner .
Fox : two . CNN : two . C zero .
So here &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
But it &apos;s not just the developed nations .
We have the technologies .
We need to do it for our own economy .
And it is based on an old model .
We now have a culture of distraction .
But we have a planetary emergency .
I wish I could find the words to convey this .
This was another hero generation that brought democracy to the planet .
We have the capacity to do it .
Let &apos;s do that . Thank you very much .
That hurts .
You have no idea .
Every single debate has been sponsored by &quot; Clean Coal . &quot;
&quot; Now , even lower emissions ! &quot;
This challenge is part of the fabric of our whole civilization .
CO2 is the exhaling breath of our civilization , literally .
Use the Internet . Go on the Internet .
Connect with people . Become very active as citizens .
We need help . We need help .
We can change things , but we have to actively change .
What &apos;s needed really is a higher level of consciousness .
So we have to have a change in consciousness .
A change in commitment . A new sense of urgency .
Al Gore , thank you so much for coming to TED .
AG : Thank you . Thank you very much .
Amy Cuddy : Your body language shapes who you are
So how many of you are sort of making yourselves smaller ?
Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this .
Sometimes we spread out .
I see you .
Even the BBC and The New York Times .
When we think about communication , we think about interactions .
So what is your body language communicating to me ?
What &apos;s mine communicating to you ?
And we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language .
If you use them poorly , bad idea . Right ?
So what nonverbals am I talking about ?
I became especially interested in nonverbal expressions of power and dominance .
And what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance ?
Well , this is what they are .
So in the animal kingdom , they are about expanding .
And humans do the same thing .
They do this .
So again , both animals and humans do the same thing .
We do the opposite of them .
When they sit down , they &apos;re sort of spread out .
They raise their hands like this .
I notice a couple of things about this .
One , you &apos;re not going to be surprised .
It seems to be related to gender .
So business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap .
There &apos;s some evidence that they do .
They also tend to be able to think more abstractly .
There are a lot of differences between powerful and powerless people .
So here &apos;s one .
A couple more .
Here are a couple more .
So you can be standing or you can be sitting .
And here are the low-power poses .
So you &apos;re folding up , you &apos;re making yourself small .
This one is very low-power .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experiment .
Here &apos;s what we find on testosterone .
So again , two minutes , and you get these changes .
Also , our bodies change our minds .
Again , this is not about you talking to other people .
So that &apos;s what we want to test . Okay ?
It &apos;s five minutes long . They are being recorded .
So this really spikes your cortisol .
We also evaluate these people much more positively overall . &quot;
No effect on those things . This is what &apos;s affected .
I don &apos;t want to feel like an impostor .
I was thrown out of a car , rolled several times .
They say , &quot; You &apos;re not going to finish college .
Eventually I graduated from college .
I am an impostor .
You are going to fake it .
And the second was , she is supposed to be here !
Like , she can fake it , she can become it .
So she had changed .
Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes .
So this is two minutes .
Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
Get your testosterone up . Get your cortisol down .
I don &apos;t have ego involved in this .
Thank you .
Lee Smolin : Science and democracy
So how does it work ?
And here are some of the ethical principles .
I &apos;m in entertain , amaze mode .
And I want to talk about three stages in that evolution .
And the idea is that everything is defined .
And they were very closely associated .
In fact , Newton and Locke were friends .
And let me show you .
This universe is described by being a network of relationships .
And this network of relations is ever-evolving .
So we call it a relational universe .
All properties of things are about these kinds of relationships .
So this is general relativity , this is quantum theory .
They &apos;re thinking about the same things .
So there &apos;s an interesting discussion going on there .
This last view of cosmology is called the relational view .
So in a relational universe we must have processes of self-organization .
That was the triumph of Neo-Darwinism and so forth .
Noel Bairey Merz : The single biggest health threat women face
So this is the leading killer of women .
Because the personal , as you know , is political .
And not enough is being done about this .
Since 1984 , more women die in the U.S. than men .
It &apos;s certainly what I learned when I was training .
So it &apos;s a woman &apos;s disease now .
So that was a big wake-up call in the 1980 &apos;s .
Heart disease kills more women at all ages than breast cancer .
Now sometimes when people see this , I hear this gasp .
I &apos;m going to tell you why .
Heart disease kills people , often very quickly .
Breast cancer , mortality is down to four percent .
And that is the 40 years that women have advocated .
And then physicians have gone to bat .
We &apos;ve done the research .
We have effective therapies now .
Women are living longer than ever .
It &apos;s not happening , and it &apos;s time .
We owe an incredible debt of gratitude to these two women .
And she wanted to study the Talmud .
And so how did she get educated then ?
She had to impersonate a man .
She had to look like a man .
Bernadine Healy , Dr. Healy , was a cardiologist .
Mortality is not going down , it &apos;s going up .
And here &apos;s what the story is .
And they &apos;re just passed .
And this is the biggest biomedical enterprise research in the world .
