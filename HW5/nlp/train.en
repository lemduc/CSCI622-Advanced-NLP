Rachel Pike : The science behind a climate headline
That report was written by 620 scientists from 40 countries .
They wrote almost a thousand pages on the topic .
Over 15,000 scientists go to San Francisco every year for that .
We blow it up and look at the pieces .
This is the EUPHORE Smog Chamber in Spain .
But still , we look at the pieces .
And it takes weeks to perform our integrations .
We also fly all over the world looking for this thing .
And this is the tower from below .
So maybe you took a similar aircraft to get here today .
We hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering .
We have to get special flight clearance .
So you can imagine the scale of the effort .
Thank you very much .
Christopher deCharms : A look inside the brain in real time
You can mimic what you can see .
You can program the hundreds of muscles in your arm .
I &apos;m going to tell you about that technology .
People envision this as being very difficult .
It was terribly dangerous .
You could be attacked by white blood cells in the arteries .
But now , we have a real technology to do this .
We &apos;re going to fly into my colleague Peter &apos;s brain .
We &apos;re going to do it non-invasively using MRI .
He can look at these 65,000 points of activation per second .
So put your arms back up and flex your bicep .
When they control their brain , they can control their pain .
When you do , what do you want to control ?
But I want to leave with you the big question .
Where will we take it ?
Beeban Kidron : The shared wonder of film
We are inveterate storytellers .
Cinema is arguably the 20th century &apos;s most influential art form .
As a filmmaker , it worried me .
The films were curated and contextualized .
The outcome , immediate .
It was an education of the most profound and transformative kind .
It &apos;s a remarkable comment on slums , poverty and aspiration .
Frank Capra &apos;s classic values independence and propriety .
After all , Jimmy Stewart filibustered for two entire reels .
As they watch more films their lives got palpably richer .
&quot; Pickpocket &quot; started a debate about criminality disenfranchisement .
&quot; To Sir , with Love &quot; ignited its teen audience .
And those without friends started making them .
The films provided communality across all manner of divide .
And the stories they held provided a shared experience .
Who was right , who wrong ?
What would they do under the same conditions ?
Was the tale told well ?
Was there a hidden message ?
How has the world changed ? How could it be different ?
And they themselves had not known they cared .
I have an aunt who is a wonderful storyteller .
I was past 40 when my father died .
He never mentioned that journey .
After two years in hiding , my grandfather appeared in London .
He was never right again .
And his story was hushed as he assimilated .
But within the reels lie purpose and meaning .
Consider &quot; Citizen Kane &quot; as valuable as Jane Austen .
They are neither feral nor myopically self-absorbed .
Thank you .
Ellen Jorgensen : Biohacking -- you can do it , too
It &apos;s a great time to be a molecular biologist .
Reading and writing DNA code is getting easier and cheaper .
Biotech is probably the most powerful and the fastest-growing technology sector .
So who gets to do it ?
But what about that guy ?
In 2009 , I first heard about DIYbio .
I thought so .
The press started calling us .
Let me take you on a little tour .
Biohackers work alone .
We reverse engineer lab equipment .
We genetically engineer bacteria .
We like to build things .
Then we like to take things apart .
We make things grow .
We make things glow .
And we make cells dance .
I &apos;m not going to minimize those concerns .
That &apos;s a lot more than conventional science has done .
Now , we follow state and local regulations .
I &apos;ve actually chosen to take a different kind of risk .
I signed up for something called the Personal Genome Project .
So this stuff is just beginning .
We &apos;re only seeing just the tip of the DNA iceberg .
Let me show you what you could do right now .
I discovered an invasive species in my own backyard .
Looked like a ladybug , right ?
It actually is a Japanese beetle .
You can make some sort of a biofuel cell .
You can do a lot of things .
It &apos;s really cool .
Some people ask me , well , why am I involved ?
I could have a perfectly good career in mainstream science .
It just has to follow safety guidelines .
It &apos;s spaces like these that spawned personal computing .
Why not personal biotech ?
Geert Chatrou : A whistleblower you haven &apos;t heard
Thank you very much .
That was whistling .
I &apos;m trying to do this in English .
So I whistled along with him .
I whistled alone . I whistled in the classroom .
I whistled on &#91; my &#93; bike . I whistled everywhere .
So &quot; Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer &quot; -- you know it ?
But it can also sound like this .
And I just couldn &apos;t .
So , okay , I &apos;m going to America .
I would love to , but why ?
So I immediately called her up , of course .
She didn &apos;t expect me to go there .
And I would have lost my face .
I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s correct English .
But the Dutch people here will understand what I mean .
I lost my face .
And she thought , &quot; He will never go there . &quot;
But actually I did .
That was great fun , of course .
Then I couldn &apos;t participate for a few years .
And actually I earn my money whistling at the moment .
So I quit my day job as a nurse .
Okay , I &apos;m not the only one whistling here .
You say , &quot; Huh , what do you mean ? &quot;
Well actually , you are going to whistle along .
Why ? Can I go away ? &quot;
No , you can &apos;t .
Actually it &apos;s very simple .
It &apos;s about 80 minutes long .
No , no , no . It &apos;s four minutes long .
And I want to first rehearse with you your whistling .
So I whistle the tone .
Sorry . I forgot one thing .
You whistle the same tone as me .
I heard a wide variety of tones .
This is very promising .
This is very promising .
I &apos;ll ask the technicians to start the music .
Oh , hah .
I &apos;m so sorry , technicians .
I &apos;m so used to that .
I start it myself .
Okay , here it is .
Okay .
It &apos;s easy , isn &apos;t it ?
Now comes the solo . I propose I do that myself .
Geert Chatrou : Thank you . Thank you .
Francesca Fedeli : Ciao .
So he &apos;s Mario . He &apos;s our son .
But in the end everything seemed to be under control .
So he got the right weight at birth .
He got the right Apgar index .
So we were pretty reassured by this .
As you might know , a stroke is a brain injury .
So life had to change .
We needed to change our schedule .
As you may imagine , unfortunately , we were not ready .
And that has been really a tough time .
And what went wrong ?
Will he be able to be normal ?
Honestly , we went down .
So immediately , as Francesca said , we changed our life .
Basically , we spent months doing this with Mario .
He was looking at us .
We were his mirror .
And that day really changed our perspective .
And we started from our passions .
This short video is from last week .
This is why we are here .
Mario !
And we thank you so much , all of you .
Thank you . Thank you . Bye .
Thank you .
Mark Shaw : One very dry demo
Not anymore .
Porous , nonporous .
So what &apos;s superhydrophobic ?
A windshield coating is going to give you about 110 degrees .
Did you guess the one that was dry ?
And we &apos;re talking really small here .
So very small , but very useful .
And it &apos;s not just water that this works with .
You can see the difference .
It &apos;s that afraid of the water .
So what &apos;s going on here ? What &apos;s happening ?
So what are the applications ?
We &apos;ve certainly seen that today .
It could be anti-corrosion .
No water , no corrosion .
It could be anti-bacterial .
Without water , the bacteria won &apos;t survive .
It &apos;s happening !
Dan Ariely : Our buggy moral code
I was burned very badly .
And the nurses told me two things .
This is not just in Hebrew , by the way .
So that &apos;s what I did .
I kept on doing this for a while .
And here &apos;s how it went .
Other people I would tempt to cheat .
I would pass their sheet of paper .
People now solved seven questions on average .
You say , what &apos;s the probability of being caught ?
How much do I stand to gain from cheating ?
And how much punishment would I get if I get caught ?
So , we try to test this .
What about the probability of being caught ?
Some people shredded the whole sheet of paper .
We call this like a personal fudge factor .
Now , how would you test a personal fudge factor ?
Then they shredded it . No cheating whatsoever .
So , all this was about decreasing the fudge factor .
What about increasing the fudge factor ?
No bill ever disappeared .
Think about the following intuition .
These things feel very differently .
Our subjects doubled their cheating .
People see each other behaving .
What does this cause us ?
So , we did another experiment .
The same thing happens .
When we give people the opportunity to cheat , they cheat .
They cheat just by a little bit , all the same .
But in this experiment we also hired an acting student .
That &apos;s it . The task is finished . &quot;
Nobody knew it was an actor .
And they clearly cheated in a very , very serious way .
What would happen to the other people in the group ?
Will they cheat more , or will they cheat less ?
Here is what happens .
Here is the thing .
We ran this at Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh .
It was about the norms for cheating .
So , what have we learned from this about cheating ?
We &apos;ve learned that a lot of people can cheat .
They cheat just by a little bit .
When we remind people about their morality , they cheat less .
Would they not be able to see it this way ?
Of course they would .
The question is , are we going to test those intuitions ?
And I learned two interesting things .
I felt my intuition was correct . &quot;
Thank you very much .
Jane McGonigal : Massively multi-player … thumb-wrestling ?
So thank you , Monochrom .
Sunni , let &apos;s just remind them .
So the first thing we need is more thumbs .
So Eric , come on over .
That is not how you win .
Ah , who did that ? Eric you did that .
We can really go for it .
So you can see up here .
So I think we should kind of get some more involved .
Perfect .
So this is the kind of simple level , right ?
But there are advanced configurations .
This is called the Death Star Configuration .
Any Star Wars fans ?
And this one &apos;s called the Möbius Strip .
Any science geeks , you get that one .
This is the hardest level . This is the extreme .
Thirty seconds . Into the network . Make the node .
Stand up ! It &apos;s easier if you stand up .
Everybody , up up up up up !
Stand up , my friends .
All right .
Don &apos;t start wrestling yet .
Okay . We need to do a last-minute thumb check .
Grab that thumb !
Reach behind you . There you go .
Any other thumbs ?
Try to keep track . Grab , grab , grab it .
Okay ? One , two , three , go !
Well done . Thank you . Thank you very much .
All right .
So curiosity .
I said &quot; massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling . &quot;
So I provoked a little curiosity .
I &apos;m reaching around and I &apos;m reaching up .
So you used creativity . That was great .
You heard that sound go up in the room .
We have relief . You got to stand up .
We had some contentment .
And it &apos;s truly awesome and wondrous .
And the last emotion of pride .
How many people are like me . Just admit it .
You lost both your thumbs .
It just didn &apos;t work out for you .
That &apos;s okay , because you learned a new skill today .
So congratulations .
How many of you won just won thumb ?
All right . I have very good news for you .
So congratulations , grandmasters .
Win one thumb once , you will become a grandmaster .
Did anybody win both their thumbs ?
Yes . Awesome . Okay .
Get ready to update your Twitter or Facebook status .
Pick off the one that looks easiest .
They &apos;re not paying attention . They look kind of weak .
Focus on that one and do something crazy with this arm .
As soon as you win , suddenly stop .
Everybody is thrown off . You go in for the kill .
Thank you for letting me teach you my favorite game .
Wooo !
Thank you .
David Byrne : How architecture helped music evolve
It was , remarkably , a pretty good sounding room .
This is a song that was recorded there .
This is not Talking Heads , in the picture anyway .
The lyrics of the songs could be pretty much understood .
The sound system was kind of decent .
And there wasn &apos;t a lot of reverberation in the room .
So the rhythms could be pretty intact too , pretty concise .
Other places around the country had similar rooms .
This is Tootsie &apos;s Orchid Lounge in Nashville .
The clientele behavior was very much the same too .
And it &apos;s been very exciting .
Is that a kind of model for creativity ?
Okay , Africa .
The music works perfectly in that setting .
It &apos;s no accident .
It &apos;s perfect for that particular context .
In a gothic cathedral , this kind of music is perfect .
It actually improves it .
This is a little bit later .
This is the kind of rooms that Mozart wrote in .
I think we &apos;re in like 1770 , somewhere around there .
It fits the room perfectly .
This is La Scala .
And well , that was an opera experience .
This is the opera house that Wagner built for himself .
And the size of the room is not that big .
It &apos;s smaller than this .
But Wagner made an innovation .
He wanted a bigger band .
Okay .
This is Carnegie Hall .
Obviously , this kind of thing became popular .
The halls got bigger . Carnegie Hall &apos;s fair-sized .
It &apos;s larger than some of the other symphony halls .
And they &apos;re a lot more reverberant than La Scala .
They had to be very quiet .
This is Mahler .
It looks like Bob Dylan , but it &apos;s Mahler .
That was Bob &apos;s last record , yeah .
Popular music , coming along at the same time .
This is a jazz band .
Again , it &apos;s noisy . They &apos;re playing for dancers .
And they &apos;d say , &quot; Play that part again . &quot;
So the bands started to improvise new melodies .
And a new form of music was born .
These are played mainly in small rooms .
People are dancing , shouting and drinking .
&#91; Live music &#93; doesn &apos;t really change that much .
And this was one way that the music got there .
Other singers after him went even further .
This is Chet Baker .
It would have been impossible without recorded music as well .
And he &apos;s singing right into your ear .
He &apos;s whispering into your ears .
The effect is just electric .
So at this point , music diverged .
There &apos;s live music , and there &apos;s recorded music .
And they no longer have to be exactly the same .
So the early hip-hop guys would loop certain sections .
And another new form of music was born .
Musicians who ended up there did the best they could .
The tempos are medium . It sounds big .
It &apos;s more a social situation than a musical situation .
So there &apos;s more new venues .
One of the new ones is the automobile .
I grew up with a radio in a car .
But now that &apos;s evolved into something else .
The car is a whole venue .
Automobile music , you can share with your friends .
Presumably , this is just for Christian music .
So that doesn &apos;t really work .
And does it happen anywhere else ?
So birds do it too .
Yeah . I think it &apos;s evolutionary .
It &apos;s adaptive .
We already know where that passion is going .
But this conflict of views is kind of interesting .
And they &apos;ll vote for that .
We adapt .
We sing .
Thank you very much .
Kevin Breel : Confessions of a depressed comic
That &apos;s the life everyone sees .
But that &apos;s sadness . That &apos;s a natural thing .
That &apos;s a natural human emotion .
It &apos;s a massive problem .
But we don &apos;t see it on social media , right ?
That &apos;s their problem . &quot;
I came this close to doing it .
See , some people might fear girls not liking them back .
Some people might fear sharks . Some people might fear death .
You don &apos;t beat it once and it &apos;s gone forever .
That &apos;s what keeps you from getting help .
That &apos;s what makes you hold it in and hide it .
That &apos;s the stigma .
And I don &apos;t know what the solution is .
We need to speak up and shatter the silence .
You &apos;re wrong , because it &apos;s the opposite .
We &apos;re people , and we have problems .
We &apos;re not perfect , and that &apos;s okay .
And I believe that we can .
I believe that we can . Thank you guys so much .
This is a dream come true . Thank you .
Thank you .
Ronny Edry : Israel and Iran : A love story ?
And I was like , &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
We don &apos;t know people from Iran .
And now people from Iran are talking to me .
So I &apos;m like , whoa .
And everybody &apos;s crying now .
Because it &apos;s working , put me in a poster now .
Tell the Iranians we from Israel love you too . &quot;
It was a huge amount of pictures .
If it &apos;s an image , they may read it .
So here are a few of them .
They have graphic designers . What ?
Crazy , crazy .
So . And now it &apos;s communication .
And it became really big at some point .
And then it became news .
Who is everybody ? &quot; &quot; Everybody . &quot;
They said , &quot; Syria ? &quot; &quot; Syria . &quot;
&quot; Lebanon ? &quot; &quot; Lebanon . &quot;
It &apos;s everybody . &quot; The Chinese .
And we were just at the beginning of the story .
Something crazy also happened .
I give you Iran-Loves-Israel . &quot;
You have Palestine-Loves-Israel .
You have Lebanon that just -- a few days ago .
We really changed how people see the Middle East .
Because you &apos;re not in the Middle East .
And for a few days you got those images .
They see images of us , and they see bad images .
Look at this one . This is the Iran-Loves-Israel page .
This is not the Israel-Loves-Iran . This is not my page .
This is the enemy .
What ?
And it &apos;s going both ways .
And we &apos;re understanding . And you show compassion .
And you become friends .
You can go and travel and meet people .
And I was in Munich a few weeks ago .
And that was the end of it .
Remember that image from the beginning ?
And it goes the other way around .
Just read where those guys are from .
Just people sending their pictures .
Crazy , yes ?
I know how it can look really bad .
And really , we can be our own ambassadors .
We can just send a message and hope for the best .
And maybe that image will help us change something .
Just raise that . Exactly .
Oh my God .
Don &apos;t cry .
Thank you guys .
Charles Moore : Seas of plastic
Let &apos;s talk trash .
Only we humans make waste that nature can &apos;t digest .
Plastics are also hard to recycle .
It &apos;s diddly-point-squat .
That &apos;s the percentage we recycle .
Now , melting point has a lot to do with this .
Notice that the bottles here have caps on them .
but , mostly bottle caps .
We cleaned up the swaths of beach shown .
I offered five cents each for bottle caps .
I got plenty of takers .
Here are the 1,100 bottle caps they collected .
I thought I would spend 20 bucks .
That day I ended up spending nearly 60 .
And this .
Now , you can buy certified organic produce .
This is the legacy we are leaving to future generations .
The throwaway society cannot be contained -- it has gone global .
We simply cannot store and maintain or recycle all our stuff .
We have to throw it away .
All the king &apos;s horses and all the king &apos;s men ...
Anchor : He offers no hope of cleaning it up .
Charles Moore : Thank you .
Carolyn Steel : How food shapes our cities
How do you feed a city ?
It &apos;s one of the great questions of our time .
Yet it &apos;s one that &apos;s rarely asked .
And increasingly these landscapes are not just feeding us either .
And it &apos;s an escalating problem too .
So meat and urbanism are rising hand in hand .
And that &apos;s going to pose an enormous problem .
Six billion hungry carnivores to feed , by 2050 .
We &apos;re very hungry for fossil fuels too .
Half the food produced in the USA is currently thrown away .
None of it makes very much sense .
So how did we get here ?
Because , as you can see , it was crescent shaped .
And it was also fertile .
And in fact , that &apos;s true of every ancient city .
But of course not all of them were that small .
So how did a city like this feed itself ?
The answer is what I call &quot; ancient food miles . &quot;
And the food obviously went off very quickly .
So Rome shaped its hinterland through its appetite .
So the grain markets were to the south of the city .
And the same of course was true for fish .
Which is extraordinary , really , when you think about it .
But also you have to imagine it full of food .
And then 10 years later everything changed .
This is an image of the Great Western in 1840 .
And they &apos;re coming into the city by rail .
And this changes everything .
All of a sudden they are effectively emancipated from geography .
Now it &apos;s anonymous .
We just read the back of a label on a packet .
So instead of trusting it , we fear it .
And instead of valuing it , we throw it away .
So what are we going to do about that ?
It &apos;s not a new question .
500 years ago it &apos;s what Thomas More was asking himself .
This is the frontispiece of his book &quot; Utopia . &quot;
the ordering principle of his vision .
Utopia was actually a word that Thomas Moore used deliberately .
It can either mean a good place , or no place .
I believe we already live in Sitopia .
Well I think it looks a bit like this .
This is where food should be in our society .
By the way , these can be men as well .
We need these people . We &apos;re part of a network .
But networks , markets where food is being grown locally .
It &apos;s common . It &apos;s fresh .
It &apos;s part of the social life of the city .
Cows with a view .
Steaming piles of humus .
This is basically bringing the whole thing together .
And this is a community project I visited recently in Toronto .
It &apos;s a re-conceptualization of the way food shapes our lives .
It &apos;s Ambrogio Lorenzetti &apos;s &quot; Allegory of Good Government . &quot;
It &apos;s about the relationship between the city and the countryside .
And I think the message of this is very clear .
What would an allegory of good government look like today ?
Because I think it &apos;s an urgent question .
We know we are what we eat .
Thank you very much .
Eddi Reader : &quot; Kiteflyer &apos;s Hill &quot;
So this is another one dedicated to that guy ...
who I &apos;ve got over .
But this is &quot; Kiteflyer &apos;s Hill . &quot;
Thank you very much .
Christopher C. Deam : The Airstream , restyled
In fact it appeared like they referenced a mountain cabin .
So that became a challenge .
It &apos;s a compound curve interior .
That &apos;s the trailer , pretty much finished .
The trailers themselves are actually hand-built .
They didn &apos;t want to go to a componentized system .
And there it is , that &apos;s the Bambi 16 .
Elliot Krane : The mystery of chronic pain
Please keep your seat .
A very different feeling .
Now what does it have to do with chronic pain ?
Imagine , if you will , these two ideas together .
In fact , imagine something even worse .
It was cadaverically cold to the touch .
How can the nervous system get this so wrong ?
So people imagine the nervous system is just like that .
These glial cells become activated .
And that &apos;s why pain becomes its own disease .
The nervous system has plasticity .
It changes , and it morphs in response to stimuli .
Well , what do we do about that ?
What can we do in a case like Chandler &apos;s ?
But the future is actually even brighter .
Thank you very much .
Bruce Aylward : How we &apos;ll stop polio for good
Actually , it &apos;s a really big idea .
This is a polio vaccine .
This is a great technology .
We can take it completely for granted .
But it wasn &apos;t always that way .
People were terrified of this disease .
And it was because of scenes like this .
In this scene , people are living in an iron lung .
This disease was terrifying .
There was no cure , and there was no vaccine .
Twenty years later , they succeeded and developed the polio vaccine .
It was hailed as a scientific miracle in the late 1950s .
But this wasn &apos;t the case everywhere in the world .
But the reality is that polio still exists today .
This is the picture .
There &apos;s not very much left in the world .
Hundreds of people were paralyzed .
Hundreds of people died -- children as well as adults .
They had come from thousands of miles away .
And in one case , it originated on another continent .
But the message was very clear .
Polio is still a devastating , explosive disease .
It &apos;s just happening in another part of the world .
We &apos;re not trying to control polio .
So what we &apos;re looking for is a permanent solution .
This virus can only survive in people .
It can &apos;t live for a very long time in people .
It doesn &apos;t survive in the environment hardly at all .
So we are trying to wipe out this virus completely .
So those are the kind of stakes that we &apos;re after .
So it was a massive effort .
Even then , kids need many doses of the vaccine .
With polio it &apos;s almost completely different .
Now giving the polio vaccine is simple .
It &apos;s just two drops , like that .
But reaching 500 million people is much , much tougher .
But one of the most extraordinary is Rotary International .
They &apos;re right at the center of the whole thing .
Last year , it was 1,000 .
We should abandon this idea of eradication .
Let &apos;s settle for control -- that &apos;s good enough . &quot;
There &apos;s absolutely no question .
These are children like Umar .
Umar also has polio .
Umar was paralyzed for life .
His right leg was paralyzed in 2004 .
Umar is an exceptional kid in exceptional circumstances .
The reality of polio today is something very different .
Polio strikes the poorest communities in the world .
We think children deserve better .
And we didn &apos;t start with the easy places .
And yet , the impossible is happening .
India &apos;s not unique .
Now we &apos;re in tough times economically .
Finishing polio eradication is the right thing to do .
Here &apos;s a great idea to spread : End polio now .
Help us tell the story .
Thank you .
Where would you say we need to be the smartest ?
It keeps getting reinfected .
They &apos;re going to be the tough ones .
Now what about the money ?
And is it easy to raise that money ?
B It &apos;s interesting .
That &apos;s what it costs to reach 500 million children .
But right now we don &apos;t have enough of that .
And that great buy costs us a little bit more .
So good luck . We &apos;re all in this with you .
Thank you .
Frank Warren : Half a million secrets
Hi , my name is Frank , and I collect secrets .
It all started with a crazy idea in November of 2004 .
I printed up 3,000 self-addressed postcards , just like this .
But soon the idea began spreading virally .
Soon my crazy idea didn &apos;t seem so crazy .
PostSecret.com is the most visited advertisement-free blog in the world .
And this is my postcard collection today .
I never did have someone . &quot;
Secrets can take many forms .
They can be shocking or silly or soulful .
Maybe one of you sent this one in .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; Dear Birthmother , I have great parents .
I &apos;ve found love . I &apos;m happy . &quot;
&quot; Your mic wasn &apos;t off during sound check .
We all heard you pee . &quot;
Right . You know what I &apos;m saying .
He pays me a lot to keep it a secret . &quot;
It &apos;s in my pocket right now . &quot;
He said , &quot; My knees are still shaking . &quot;
But she finally did .
She got to that bottom secret , his proposal to her .
And he emailed me this picture .
&quot; I found your camera at Lollapalooza this summer .
This one &apos;s my favorite .
&quot; That &apos;s me , my husband and son .
The other pictures are of my very ill grandmother .
Thank you for making your site .
These pictures mean more to me than you know .
My son &apos;s birth is on this camera .
He turns four tomorrow . &quot;
Secrets can take many forms .
They can be shocking or silly or soulful .
Voicemail recording : First saved voice message .
Have a real happy birthday , and I love you .
I &apos;ll say bye for now .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Frank , that was beautiful , so touching .
Have you ever sent yourself a postcard ?
Have you ever sent in a secret to PostSecret ?
I have one of my own secrets in every book .
Has anyone in your life been able to tell ?
Sometimes I share that information , yeah .
Tony Porter : A call to men
This is my two at home , Kendall and Jay .
They &apos;re 11 and 12 .
Kendall &apos;s 15 months older than Jay .
Daddy &apos;s got you . That &apos;s all that &apos;s important .
Hold your head up . Look at me .
Explain to me what &apos;s wrong .
Tell me what &apos;s wrong . I can &apos;t understand you .
Why are you crying ? &quot;
Just go on , go on in your room .
Like a man .
And he &apos;s five years old .
What am I doing ? Why would I do this ? &quot;
And I think back .
I think back to my father .
We lived in New York City , as I said .
And the limousine empties out .
I grew up in tenement buildings in the inner city .
And he was hanging out with all us younger guys .
He was a troubled kid .
His mother had died from a heroin overdose .
He was being raised by his grandmother .
His father wasn &apos;t on the set .
His grandmother had two jobs .
He was home alone a lot .
He was cool . He was fine .
He was having sex .
We all looked up to him .
They called me Anthony growing up as a kid .
&quot; Hey Anthony , come on upstairs . &quot;
Johnny call , you go .
So I run right upstairs .
Now I immediately knew what he meant .
Two things : One , I never had sex .
We don &apos;t talk about that as men .
There ain &apos;t no first time .
Women are objects , especially sexual objects .
Anyway , so I couldn &apos;t tell him any of that .
He told me to go in his room .
She &apos;s 16 years old .
She &apos;s nude .
We had a whole choice of inappropriate names for her .
Anyway , Johnny had just gotten through having sex with her .
So he was offering me the opportunity to do the same .
Folks , I &apos;m petrified .
So now there &apos;s a living room full of guys .
It was like the waiting room in the doctor &apos;s office .
But I knew I felt bad about what was happening .
We see that as an equation that equals violence against women .
I need you on board . I need you with me .
He said to me , &quot; I would be free . &quot;
Thank you folks .
Stanley McChrystal : Listen , learn ... then lead
And you put on the T-10 parachute .
Then you take off .
They give 20 minutes -- that &apos;s a time warning .
You sit there , OK .
Then they give you 10 minutes .
And of course , you &apos;re responding with all of these .
Then they give you , &quot; Get ready . &quot;
Then they go , &quot; Outboard personnel , stand up . &quot;
If you &apos;re an outboard personnel , now you stand up .
If you &apos;re an inboard personnel , stand up .
I &apos;m probably going to jump .
So nice air comes flowing in .
The jumpmasters start to check the door .
Jump is a misnomer ; you fall .
But typically you do ; typically it opens .
Boom .
Now you prepare for the inevitable .
You are going to hit the ground .
You can &apos;t delay that much .
It &apos;s this elegant little land , twist and roll .
And that &apos;s not going to hurt .
In 30-some years of jumping , I never did one .
They &apos;d be doing everything that we had taught them .
When we landed on the drop-zone , everything had changed .
But things had changed ; I was a 46-year-old brigadier general .
And I also was raised with personal examples of leadership .
This was my father in Vietnam .
And I still believe real leaders are like that .
And I &apos;m not sure that was real interaction .
And I had an armored organization at that point .
The enemy didn &apos;t break a sweat doing it .
Sort of leadership by humiliation .
But everything we do is in a different context .
I have to have trust in them and vice versa .
And I also have to build their faith .
And that &apos;s a new kind of leadership for me .
We failed .
The mission didn &apos;t work .
Entirely new requirement .
Also , the people had changed .
And yet , we need to have that shared sense .
And it &apos;s a brand new leadership challenge .
Then another thing .
There &apos;s an effect on you and on your leaders .
There &apos;s an impact , it &apos;s cumulative .
You don &apos;t reset , or recharge your battery every time .
And I remembered his son was in our force .
I said , &quot; Where is he now ? &quot;
Think about knowing that over time .
And it &apos;s a new cumulative pressure on leaders .
And you have to watch and take care of each other .
I probably learned the most about relationships .
I learned they are the sinew which hold the force together .
I grew up much of my career in the Ranger regiment .
It &apos;s a promise .
And every Ranger gets that same promise from every other Ranger .
Think about it . It &apos;s extraordinarily powerful .
It &apos;s probably more powerful than marriage vows .
And so the organizational relationship that bonds them is just amazing .
And I learned personal relationships were more important than ever .
That was my journey .
I hope it &apos;s not over .
This isn &apos;t easy stuff .
And it isn &apos;t always fair .
Thank you .
Arunachalam Muruganantham : How I started a sanitary napkin revolution !
I saw . &quot; What is that ? &quot; I asked .
My wife replied , &quot; None of your business . &quot;
I don &apos;t even use that cloth to clean my two-wheeler .
And it &apos;s called affordability .
Why not make a local sanitary pad for my new wife ?
So only problem : the only available victim is my wife .
Close your eyes . &quot;
Because I tried to make it intimate .
Because it &apos;s an arranged marriage , not a love marriage .
Then other victims , they got into my sisters .
They are having a lot of women volunteers around them .
Why I am not getting &#91; any &#93; ?
Then I used , tried to use the medical college girls .
My God , it &apos;s unbelievable .
You need first funds .
Why is this ? I used medical college girls .
That is my invention .
Why are they coming for , finally , for philanthropy ?
Why the need for accumulating money , then doing philanthropy ?
What if one decided to start philanthropy from the day one ?
Play video one .
Why not make myself a low-cost napkin ?
That is my idea .
They are performing puja .
I make a rural woman to compete with multinationals .
I &apos;m sustaining on seventh year .
Already 600 installations . What is my mission ?
That &apos;s why I &apos;m not running after this bloody money .
I &apos;m doing something serious .
Do your job simply , the girl will chase you .
Like that , I never chased Mahalakshmi .
Not in front pocket . I &apos;m a back pocket man .
I am becoming a solution provider . I &apos;m very happy .
I don &apos;t want to make this as a corporate entity .
Now 110 countries are accessing it . Okay ?
Thank you very much . Bye !
Stephen Hawking : Questioning the universe
There is nothing bigger or older than the universe .
How did the universe come into being ?
Are we alone in the universe ?
Is there alien life out there ?
What is the future of the human race ?
Then it was discovered that the universe was expanding .
Distant galaxies were moving away from us .
This meant they must have been closer together in the past .
This was the Big Bang , the beginning of the universe .
But was there anything before the Big Bang ?
If not , what created the universe ?
The universe can spontaneously create itself out of nothing .
We think we have solved the mystery of creation .
But we don &apos;t know how life first appeared .
This suggests that a probability of life appearing is reasonably high .
I am discounting the reports of UFOs .
Why would they appear only to cranks and weirdoes ?
But we are entering an increasingly dangerous period of our history .
Thank you for listening .
Professor Hawking , thank you for that answer .
Thank you very much indeed .
Amanda Bennett : We need a heroic narrative for death
So I went to a party .
I talk to him for hours .
Only months later , I discover who he really was .
He was the China representative for the American Soybean Association .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand . Soybeans ?
You told me you were a Fulbright scholar . &quot;
I said , &quot; You jerk . &quot;
Only jerk wasn &apos;t the word I used .
I said , &quot; You could &apos;ve gotten me fired . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Let &apos;s get married . &quot;
&quot; Travel the world and have lots of kids . &quot;
So we did .
And for years , it seemed like we were succeeding .
The surgeon emerged from the surgery .
And yet , he did not die .
Mysteriously , he lived on .
He coached Little League for our son .
He built a playhouse for our daughter .
I &apos;m looking for a cure .
So we try another treatment , aggressive , nasty .
Then another year goes by .
Two years go by .
More specialists .
We take the kids to Italy .
We take the kids to Australia .
This time , there &apos;s new treatments on the horizon .
They &apos;re exotic . They &apos;re experimental .
They &apos;re going to attack the cancer in new ways .
So he enters a clinical trial , and it works .
There &apos;s another drug out there .
It &apos;s newer . It &apos;s more powerful .
He started it just two weeks ago .
Perhaps there &apos;s still hope ahead .
So what do I say ?
I say , &quot; Keep him alive if you can . &quot;
And Terence died six days later .
So we fought , we struggled , we triumphed .
We fought together , we lived together .
It was also an expensive fight .
We never got the chance to say goodbye .
We never thought it was the end .
We always had hope .
So what do we make of all of this ?
And what did I discover ?
Yet I had that piece of paper .
We both did .
And they were readily available .
I had them right at hand .
Yet we never got to no further hope .
Now , what do the experts call this ?
They say it &apos;s denial .
It &apos;s a strong word , isn &apos;t it ?
The family won &apos;t listen to reason .
They &apos;re in denial .
How can they insist on this treatment at the end ?
It &apos;s so clear , yet they &apos;re in denial . &quot;
It &apos;s not just families either .
You want to help . You want to fix .
You want to do .
I saw it firsthand .
Days before he died .
It &apos;s not a bug .
It &apos;s a feature .
Maybe I wanted to believe it .
So what do we need ?
Maybe we don &apos;t need a new piece of paper .
People did mention hospice , but I wouldn &apos;t listen .
So I &apos;ll give you a couple lines from him .
This is a poem about Mark Antony .
Actually , one of Cleopatra &apos;s guys .
And he &apos;s been a pretty good general .
The people are leaving . They &apos;re playing instruments .
They &apos;re singing .
And suddenly he knows he &apos;s been defeated .
And the poet tells him what to do .
And isn &apos;t that what we &apos;re missing ?
The overwhelming presence of hope isn &apos;t denial .
Hope isn &apos;t a bug .
It &apos;s a feature .
Thank you .
Juliana Machado Ferreira : The fight to end rare-animal trafficking in Brazil
And in these places they are cared for .
But then what ?
All of these were released by us .
On the top , the turtles are just enjoying freedom .
But it &apos;s still a big issue in Brazil .
We believe we have performed responsible releases .
We &apos;ve registered released animals mating in nature and having chicks .
So , these genes are indeed going back to the populations .
I &apos;m devoting my career to that .
Thank you very much .
Shawn Achor : The happy secret to better work
So we were up on top of our bunk beds .
Did you see how you landed ?
No human lands on all fours like that .
Amy , I think this means you &apos;re a unicorn . &quot;
And the latter won out .
... with one broken leg .
and then we tailor the class right towards the average .
But normal is merely average .
Bobo married Amy the unicorn .
Which , even at Yale , is extraordinarily rare .
When I applied to Harvard , I applied on a dare .
Tuesday night it &apos;s school violence and bullying .
Wednesday night is eating disorders .
Thursday night is elicit drug use .
Silence on the phone .
The absence of disease is not health .
You &apos;re 37 percent better at sales .
Which means we can reverse the formula .
Exercise teaches your brain that your behavior matters .
Thank you very much .
Dan Ariely : What makes us feel good about our work ?
Think about something like mountaineering and mountain climbing .
No , they are full of misery .
I &apos;ll never do it again . &quot;
And he came one day back to campus .
He was working in a big bank .
This was in preparation for a merger and acquisition .
He stayed late at night every day .
And the guy was deeply depressed .
We &apos;ll pay you three dollars for it . &quot;
And people said yes , and they built with these Legos .
If they said yes , we gave them another one .
This was what we called the meaningful condition .
People built one Bionicle after another .
There was another condition .
This other condition was inspired by David , my student .
And this other condition we called the Sisyphic condition .
And if they said yes , they built it .
Now what happens when you compare these two conditions ?
People were not curing cancer or building bridges .
People were building Bionicles for a few cents .
So there was not a real opportunity for big meaning .
But even the small meaning made a difference .
Now we had another version of this experiment .
What happened ?
People predicted the right direction but not the right magnitude .
There was one other piece of data we looked at .
And that &apos;s actually what we found in the meaningful condition .
What happened in the Sisyphic condition ?
In that condition the correlation was zero .
We basically eliminated it .
And everybody raised their hand .
And everybody raised their hand .
And they came up with all kinds of ideas .
The next experiment was slightly different .
That was the task .
And people did the first sheet .
And we had three conditions .
What happened in those three conditions ?
At 15 cents per page , they basically stopped these efforts .
And this is basically the result we had before .
But what about the ignored condition ?
It turns out it was almost like the shredder .
Now there &apos;s good news and bad news here .
Ignoring gets you a whole way out there .
So there is a store in the U.S. called IKEA .
I put things in the wrong way .
I can &apos;t say enjoy those pieces .
I can &apos;t say I enjoy the process .
And there &apos;s an old story about cake mixes .
But it turns out they were very unpopular .
People did not want them .
And they thought about all kinds of reasons for that .
Maybe the taste was not good .
No , the taste was great .
It was as if you bought it in the store .
It didn &apos;t really feel like your own .
So what did they do ?
They took the eggs and the milk out of the powder .
Now you had to break the eggs and add them .
Now it was your cake . Now everything was fine .
So how do we look at this question experimentally ?
We asked people to build some origami .
How much do you want to pay for it ? &quot;
And we had two types of people .
Which one of those two is correct ?
They thought everybody else would love it more as well .
In the next version we tried to do the IKEA effect .
We tried to make it more difficult .
So for some people we gave the same task .
For some people we made it harder by hiding the instructions .
For some people we just eliminated that .
So now this was tougher . What happened ?
Why ? Because now the builders loved it even more .
They put all this extra effort into it .
And evaluators ? They loved it even less .
Because in reality it was even uglier than the first version .
Now think about kids .
Your memories and associations and so on .
But imagine this was slightly different .
And you played with them for a few hours .
How much would you pay for them now ?
Most people say not that much .
Those are really tough .
Let me say one last comment .
He gave an example of a pin factory .
Is efficiency still more important than meaning ?
I think the answer is no .
Thank you very much .
Amy Lockwood : Selling condoms in the Congo
The DRC is a dangerous place .
There are many health issues as well .
Damien runs a hotel outside of Kinshasa .
He said there &apos;s just not in demand .
They like the generics .
And as a marketer , I found that curious .
Sex !
Their marketing is slightly different .
It might just save their lives .
Thank you .
Vicki Arroyo : Let &apos;s prepare for our new climate
This is the skyline of my hometown , New Orleans .
Half the city is already below sea level .
The changes in these times won &apos;t affect us all equally .
And how will they cope in a foreign land ?
It &apos;s already fueled conflicts in Chad and Darfur .
Sure , some are looking for opportunities in this new world .
Their March electricity bill was only 48 dollars .
We need better planning and systems for evacuation .
Second , preparing for heat and drought .
It &apos;s giving them access to affordable credit .
So some solutions to heat can provide for win-win-wins .
Third , adapting to rising seas .
That &apos;s where half of Vietnam &apos;s rice is grown .
Infrastructure is going to be affected .
Airports around the world are located on the coast .
Imagine the staggering cost of protecting this vital infrastructure with levees .
But now , a word of caution .
Adaptation &apos;s too important to be left to the experts .
Why ? Well , there are no experts .
But we can simply no longer rely on established norms .
The larger point I &apos;m trying to make is this .
There are no quick fixes .
There are no one-size-fits-all solutions .
We &apos;re all learning by doing .
But the operative word is doing .
Thank you .
Aubrey de Grey : A roadmap to end aging
I &apos;m going to talk about why defeating aging is desirable .
I &apos;m going to do that in two steps .
So I &apos;m going to start with why we should .
Now , I want to ask a question .
That was easy . OK .
OK . So we all think malaria is a bad thing .
And here is that characteristic .
What part of this do people not understand ?
It &apos;s a global trance .
And that &apos;s true .
That &apos;s my answer to the overpopulation question .
So that &apos;s all I &apos;m going to say about that .
I &apos;m now going to talk about feasibility .
A very simple definition .
Those side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology .
So then , what do we do about that ?
But it isn &apos;t .
That &apos;s the wrong answer .
But after that , things were pretty steady and pretty uniform .
And you see it in all sorts of technologies .
This is a very important point for me to get across .
I &apos;m not saying that at all .
And the same for 300 and 400 and so on .
Well , it seems to get the point across .
You won &apos;t be able to withstand them .
And that &apos;s quite a thought .
I have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation .
And this is what it is .
I say that &apos;s nonsense .
15 years from the robust mouse .
The public &apos;s perception will probably be somewhat better than that .
The public tends to underestimate how difficult scientific things are .
So they &apos;ll probably think it &apos;s five years away .
But it is not part of metabolism itself .
And this turns out to be useful .
Because we can re-draw our original diagram this way .
The engineering approach does not intervene in any processes .
It does not intervene in this process or this one .
The point about this slide is actually the bottom .
This list is just for illustration ; it is incomplete .
The list on the right is also incomplete .
And there are only seven of them .
Of course one can make a biological argument .
We &apos;re made of cells and stuff between cells .
What can damage accumulate in ?
It &apos;s got to be long-lived molecules .
We do need to really start trying .
And we &apos;ll just end with a few things .
And you know what happened .
So , you know , this does happen .
There &apos;s a proposal to actually put together an institute .
This is what &apos;s going to take a bit of money .
Not very long . OK .
Thank you .
The genes don &apos;t care but we do ?
AG : That &apos;s right .
AG : If you lose a bit of weight .
Your numbers are a bit out .
AG : There are technical implications certainly .
Lewis Pugh : My mind-shifting Everest swim
The water is completely black .
It &apos;s flipping freezing in that water .
I heard about this lake , Lake Imja .
So it &apos;s right up in the heavens .
That &apos;s not the worst part of it .
And we walked up this pathway , all the way up .
I could barely breathe .
I was gasping for air .
I have never , ever heard such utter bollocks .
I got myself to the side of the lake .
And my team just gave it to me straight .
Take some time to rest and think about things .
Instead of swimming crawl , swim breaststroke .
And remember , never ever swim with aggression .
This is the time to swim with real humility .
And I swam across the lake .
The warning signs are all there .
And then the second lesson , the radical , tactical shift .
So thank you very , very much .
John Hodgman : Design , explained .
Ah yes , a table .
We use these every day .
And on top of it , the juicy salif .
Okay , what is this object ?
It looks terrible . Is it a little hot plate ?
I don &apos;t get it .
Does anyone know ? Chi ?
It &apos;s an ... iPhone. iPhone .
No , I have an iPhone . Of course I do .
Here is my well-loved iPhone .
I do so many things on this little device .
I like to read books on it .
And yet I forget about it all the time .
Unlike the Theme Building , this is not alien technology .
And you didn &apos;t even notice it happened .
So there you go . My name is John Hodgman .
I just explained design .
Thank you very much .
Lakshmi Pratury : The lost art of letter-writing
So I thought , &quot; I will talk about death . &quot;
Seemed to be the passion today .
Actually , it &apos;s not about death .
That &apos;s what I want to talk about .
Handwriting is a disappearing art .
But too late .
So what do I plan to leave for my son ?
I plan to publish my own notebook .
I took it out for the first time to come here .
Thank you .
Sergey Brin : Why Google Glass ?
Okay , it &apos;s great to be back at TED .
Okay , Glass , record a video .
This is it . We &apos;re on in two minutes .
Okay Glass , hang out with The Flying Club .
Google &quot; photos of tiger heads . &quot; Hmm .
You ready ? You ready ?
Right there . Okay , Glass , take a picture .
Go !
Man 6 : Holy &#91; beep &#93; ! That is awesome .
Whoa ! Look at that snake !
Woman 3 : Okay , Glass , record a video !
Man 7 : After this bridge , first exit .
Man 8 : Okay , A12 , right there !
Man 9 : Google , say &quot; delicious &quot; in Thai .
Woman 4 : Google &quot; jellyfish . &quot;
Man 10 : It &apos;s beautiful .
He needs help getting 10 million dollars .
Should it be by just walking around looking down ?
You &apos;re just kind of moving around .
And also you want something that frees your eyes .
This project has lasted now , been just over two years .
We &apos;ve learned an amazing amount .
It &apos;s been really important to make it comfortable .
So our first prototypes we built were huge .
It was like cell phones strapped to your head .
It was very heavy , pretty uncomfortable .
But we &apos;ve come a long way .
And the other really unexpected surprise was the camera .
Like if I smoked , I &apos;d probably just smoke instead .
Thank you all very much .
Brené Brown : Listening to shame
And she said , &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
I had a slide that said Breakdown .
And she said , &quot; I saw your Talk live-streamed .
It was not really you .
It was a little different than what you usually do .
But it was great . &quot;
And I said , &quot; This can &apos;t happen .
YouTube , they &apos;re putting this thing on YouTube .
And I said , &quot; Let me ask you something . &quot;
And she said , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
And she said , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
And she goes , &quot; Uh ... no . &quot;
That ... me neither . &quot;
Your sisters would be perfect for this . &quot;
I had no contingency plan for four million .
And my life did end when that happened .
But I want to talk about what I &apos;ve learned .
The first is vulnerability is not weakness .
And that myth is profoundly dangerous .
How many of you think of vulnerability and weakness synonymously ?
The majority of people .
Vulnerability is not weakness .
I define vulnerability as emotional risk , exposure , uncertainty .
It fuels our daily lives .
We &apos;d like you to come in and speak .
What would you like for me to talk about ?
There &apos;s three big answers .
To create is to make something that has never existed before .
There &apos;s nothing more vulnerable than that .
Adaptability to change is all about vulnerability .
And I &apos;m going to be really honest with you .
I &apos;ll give you an example .
I &apos;m a fifth generation Texan .
Our family motto is &quot; Lock and load . &quot;
I am not a natural vulnerability researcher .
And then I hear , &quot; Vulnerability TED ! &quot;
I turn around , I go , &quot; Hi . &quot;
&quot; Look away . &quot;
And I see you .
I learned about these things from studying shame .
And so I want to walk you in to shame .
Jungian analysts call shame the swampland of the soul .
And we &apos;re going to walk in .
Here &apos;s why .
Yes ? We heard that .
Yes ?
And all-powerful folks don &apos;t need checklists .
Myshkin Ingawale , I hope I did right by you .
I saw the TED Fellows my first day here .
And he said , &quot; I saw this need .
So you know what I did ? I made it . &quot;
And he said , &quot; And it didn &apos;t work .
You know what the big secret about TED is ?
I can &apos;t wait to tell people this .
I guess I &apos;m doing it right now .
This is like the failure conference .
No , it is .
You know why this place is amazing ?
Because very few people here are afraid to fail .
I &apos;ve failed miserably , many times .
I don &apos;t think the world understands that because of shame .
You &apos;re not good enough .
You never finished that MBA . Your wife left you .
I know those things that happened to you growing up .
Shame is that thing .
Us .
The thing to understand about shame is it &apos;s not guilt .
Shame is &quot; I am bad . &quot;
Guilt is &quot; I did something bad . &quot;
How many of you would be willing to say that ?
Guilt : I &apos;m sorry . I made a mistake .
Shame : I &apos;m sorry . I am a mistake .
There &apos;s a huge difference between shame and guilt .
And here &apos;s what you need to know .
And here &apos;s what you even need to know more .
Guilt , inversely correlated with those things .
It &apos;s uncomfortable , but it &apos;s adaptive .
Everyone sitting in here knows the warm wash of shame .
And it &apos;s a straight-jacket .
Shame is one , do not be perceived as what ?
Weak .
And I said , &quot; I don &apos;t study men . &quot;
And he said , &quot; That &apos;s convenient . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Why ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
So I started interviewing men and asking questions .
Shame is an epidemic in our culture .
Very quickly , some research by Mahalik at Boston College .
And so I &apos;ll leave you with this thought .
And that is seductive .
But the truth is that never happens .
We want you to go in .
We want to be with you and across from you .
So thank you all very much . I really appreciate it .
Eric Whitacre : Virtual Choir Live
I was in the third year of my seven-year undergraduate degree .
I took a couple victory laps in there .
Now fast forward to just three years ago .
Could we do this all in real time ?
Could we have people singing together in real time ?
Now , we &apos;ll perform &quot; Cloudburst &quot; for you .
We deal in milliseconds .
Thank you .
Laura Trice : Remember to say thank you
And I asked myself , why ?
I felt shy , I felt embarrassed .
So , I decided to investigate .
I know a woman who &apos;s good at this .
So , the question is , why was I blocking it ?
Why were other people blocking it ?
I &apos;m telling you where I &apos;m insecure .
I &apos;m telling you where I need your help .
Because what can you do with that data ?
You could neglect me .
You could abuse it .
Or you could actually meet my need .
So , I &apos;m going to challenge all of you .
Go home to your husband -- what does he need ?
And it &apos;s simple .
And why should we care about this ?
We talk about world peace .
So , let &apos;s make it right in our own backyard .
Thank you .
Carter Emmart : A 3D atlas of the universe
This is the WMAP microwave background that we see .
But this our containment of the visible universe .
I know Dr. Carolyn Porco is the camera P.I.
for the Cassini mission .
This software can also be networked between domes .
And we can network between domes and classrooms .
So you &apos;re seeing the edge of the Earth .
This is Nepal .
This is Nepal and Tibet .
We carry that in us .
Thank you .
Esther Perel : The secret to desire in a long-term relationship
That &apos;s the million-dollar question , right ?
And why is the forbidden so erotic ?
What is it about transgression that makes desire so potent ?
And when you love , how does it feel ?
And when you desire , how is it different ?
So what sustains desire , and why is it so difficult ?
Give me comfort , give me edge .
Give me novelty , give me familiarity .
Give me predictability , give me surprise .
So why does good sex so often fade ?
What is the relationship between love and desire ?
How do they relate , and how do they conflict ?
Because therein lies the mystery of eroticism .
We want to neutralize the tensions . We want closeness .
Forgone conclusion does not keep our interest .
In desire , we want a bridge to cross .
Desire needs space .
But then I took a question with me .
Not attracted sexually , per se , but most drawn .
Radiant , as in self-sustaining .
Nobody needs anybody .
There is no caretaking in desire .
Caretaking is mightily loving . It &apos;s a powerful anti-aphrodisiac .
For good reasons , right ?
But basically it &apos;s when there is novelty .
Novelty is , what parts of you do you bring out ?
What parts of you are just being seen ?
So where do you go in sex ?
What parts of you do you connect to ?
What do you seek to express there ?
Is it a place for transcendence and spiritual union ?
Is it a place where you can express your infantile wishes ?
What comes out there ? It &apos;s a language .
It isn &apos;t just a behavior .
You know , animals have sex .
But the central agent is really that piece called the imagination .
They knew how to keep themselves alive .
And so I began to ask a different question .
And then I began to ask the reverse question .
You know , the erotic mind is not very politically correct .
My partner hasn &apos;t taken care of me in so long .
I will lose my freedom in order not to lose connection .
Translate this into adult language .
&quot; Are you going to be there ?
Are you going to be angry with me ? &quot;
The third child doesn &apos;t really come back .
One , they have a lot of sexual privacy .
Foreplay pretty much starts at the end of the previous orgasm .
Responsibility and desire just butt heads .
They don &apos;t really do well together .
Erotic couples also understand that passion waxes and wanes .
But what they know is they know how to resurrect it .
Committed sex is premeditated sex .
It &apos;s willful . It &apos;s intentional .
It &apos;s focus and presence .
Merry Valentine &apos;s .
Nalini Nadkarni : Life science in prison
Trees epitomize stasis .
I simply tied the end of a paintbrush onto a twig .
You might have a guess .
And our prison system itself is stuck .
The United States has over 2.3 million incarcerated men and women .
That number is rising .
That , I think , is movement .
That , I think , is movement .
That , I think , is movement .
Thank you very much .
Sleepy Man Banjo Boys : Bluegrass virtuosity from ... New Jersey ?
Robbie Mizzone : Thank you .
Tommy Mizzone : Thank you very much .
TM : Thank you very much .
On guitar is my 15-year-old brother Tommy .
On banjo is 10-year-old Jonny .
He &apos;s also our brother .
So you can probably piece the rest together .
It might have been that it weighs about a million pounds .
TM : Thank you very much .
RM : Thank you .
Michael Hansmeyer : Building unimaginable shapes
If we could free ourselves from our education ?
What would these unseen forms look like ?
Would they surprise us ? Would they intrigue us ?
Would they delight us ?
I propose we look to nature .
Nature has been called the greatest architect of forms .
We can abstract them and to create something that is new .
We &apos;re free to choose where we make the fold .
And by doing so , we can differentiate the surfaces .
And in doing so , we can suddenly fold anything .
A simple volume , the cube .
And we can play with this .
We can begin to sculpt the form .
We can make folds that we otherwise could not make .
Surfaces can become porous .
They can stretch . They can tear .
But in each case , I didn &apos;t design the form .
I designed the process that generated the form .
White surfaces have long edges , black ones have short ones .
So let &apos;s bring this process to architecture .
How ? And at what scale ?
I chose to design a column .
Columns are architectural archetypes .
I started using four cylinders .
And these columns , they have information at very many scales .
We can begin to zoom into them .
The closer one gets , the more new features one discovers .
Some formations are almost at the threshold of human visibility .
These forms are undrawable .
In this case , the process is deterministic .
So this leads to a new role for the architect .
But enough of the theory .
There &apos;s been a lot of talk now about 3D printing .
But it was very labor intensive .
But it is increasingly possible .
These are images from the Gwangju Biennale .
Each column is effectively a hybrid of two columns .
So where does this leave us ?
In short , we have no constraints .
Thank you .
David Hoffman : Sputnik mania
The rocket was huge .
On October 4 , 1957 , they launched their rocket .
Now we have the good fortune to open up space .
For days after the launch , Sputnik was a wonderful curiosity .
All hell broke loose .
It provoked the missile gap .
It exploded an arms race .
It began the space race .
And the reactions to Sputnik went far beyond weapons increases .
But Sputnik provoked wonderful changes as well .
&quot; Sputnik &quot; will soon be released .
And I &apos;d like to thank you all .
Thank you , Chris .
Harish Manwani : Profit &apos;s not always the point
Of not just creating economic value but creating social value .
And that model is all about doing well and doing good .
But the question is easier said than done .
But how do we actually get that done ?
There are things that you stand for .
I joined Unilever in 1976 as a management trainee in India .
You &apos;re here to change lives .
You know , I thought it was rather facetious .
We are a company that sells soap and soup .
What are we doing about changing lives ?
We run the largest hand-washing program in the world .
And brands indeed can be at the forefront of social change .
Small actions can make a big difference .
We have 60,000 such women now in India .
Small actions , big difference .
So just think about it .
There are small actions that can make a big difference .
And I can go on and on .
Thank you very much .
Susan Cain : The power of introverts
Because in my family , reading was the primary group activity .
Camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol .
Rowdie , rowdie , let &apos;s get rowdie . &quot;
Yeah .
I did my best .
And I felt kind of guilty about this .
Now , I tell you this story about summer camp .
It &apos;s different from being shy .
Shyness is about fear of social judgment .
But now here &apos;s where the bias comes in .
And kids are working in countless group assignments .
Okay , same thing is true in our workplaces .
I &apos;ll give you some examples .
So no wilderness , no revelations .
So ...
And do you really want to leave it up to chance ?
One answer lies deep in our cultural history .
And they feature as their role models really great salesmen .
So that &apos;s the world we &apos;re living in today .
That &apos;s our cultural inheritance .
Guess what ?
Books .
I have a suitcase full of books .
Here &apos;s Margaret Atwood , &quot; Cat &apos;s Eye . &quot;
Here &apos;s a novel by Milan Kundera .
But these are not exactly my books .
And people would come from all over to hear him speak .
But here &apos;s the thing about my grandfather .
So I prepared for moments like these as best I could .
And I call this my &quot; year of speaking dangerously . &quot;
And that actually helped a lot .
I mean , we are .
Number one : Stop the madness for constant group work .
Just stop it .
Thank you .
That is great .
It &apos;s great for introverts and it &apos;s great for extroverts .
School , same thing .
This is especially important for extroverted children too .
Okay , number two : Go to the wilderness .
Be like Buddha , have your own revelations .
So extroverts , maybe your suitcases are also full of books .
Or maybe they &apos;re full of champagne glasses or skydiving equipment .
And that &apos;s okay .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you .
Yves Behar : Designing objects that tell stories
And then there was another influence .
Those are pretty good escapes from the drab weather in Switzerland .
And I realized then I had to go to design school .
I mean , look at those graphics there .
&quot; You know , do people really use it ?
And I didn &apos;t want to be a colorist .
It wasn &apos;t what I wanted to do .
I didn &apos;t want to be a stylist in this way .
And what I wanted to work on is important stuff .
And then finally , the leaf lamp for Herman Miller .
So , the light bulb actually does that .
But designers are really the glue that brings these things together .
And this is what we &apos;re pursuing here .
But how we work on Jawbone is really unique .
I want to point at something here , on the left .
It &apos;s really about designing from the inside out .
And it &apos;s what I call being design driven .
And then , of course , design is never done .
And here &apos;s another project , another partnership-type approach .
And this allows the bottle to turn into a game .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s another project , which I think really emulates that .
This picture is incredible .
I mean , to me , it just means so much .
But the third pillar that he talked about was design .
I didn &apos;t really want to , from the previous adventure .
They fought the suppliers , they fought the manufacturers .
And I think this is something really important .
And we went away from obviously the beige .
I mean it &apos;s colorful , it &apos;s fun .
Like paper , paper and cardboard .
These are the dispensers . There &apos;s this friendly shape .
And we also designed the condoms themselves .
Of course , clubs and discos , too .
And here &apos;s the public service announcement for this project .
Get some .
So , thank you .
Paul Root Wolpe : It &apos;s time to question bio-engineering
We altered our ecological niche by creating civilization .
Now we actually have been doing it for a long time .
Dogs are the result of selectively breeding traits that we like .
We don &apos;t have to do it that way anymore .
This is a beefalo .
A beefalo is a buffalo-cattle hybrid .
This is a geep , a goat-sheep hybrid .
I think they said it tasted like chicken .
This is a cama .
And they are now using these in certain cultures .
Then there &apos;s the liger .
It &apos;s bigger than a tiger .
And then finally , everybody &apos;s favorite , the zorse .
None of this is Photoshopped . These are real creatures .
But something much , much more powerful is happening now .
We all know that some deep-sea creatures glow .
These are normal cells .
So they did it with mouse pups , kittens .
They did it with pigs .
They did it with puppies .
And , in fact , they did it with monkeys .
Be easier to find us at night .
These are zebra fish . They &apos;re normally black and silver .
Other states have banned them .
Nobody knows what to do with these kinds of creatures .
These are all the first cloned animals of their type .
This is Prometea , the first cloned horse .
The guar is an endangered Southeast Asian ungulate .
We have two kinds of DNA in our bodies .
That DNA is passed down through our mothers .
These are really hybrids , not pure animals .
This lovely creature is an Asian cockroach .
They &apos;ve created a kind of insect bot , or bugbot .
It gets worse than that -- or perhaps better than that .
These goliath beetles are wired in their wings .
They can &apos;t actually make them land .
But it &apos;s the closest they can get to a landing .
It &apos;s not just insects .
The scientists can make this creature go left , right .
They &apos;ve now created an organic robot .
We &apos;ve taken away the autonomy of this animal . &quot;
I &apos;ll get back to that in a minute .
There &apos;s also been work done with monkeys .
This is Miguel Nicolelis of Duke .
This is Thomas DeMarse at the University of Florida .
They self-aggregated into a network , became an integrated chip .
This is a brain from a lamprey eel .
It &apos;s photophilic .
So now we have a complete living lamprey eel brain .
Genetic engineering coupled with polymer physiotechnology coupled with xenotransplantation .
This is where we are in this process .
This is what Frankenstein &apos;s lab looks like .
And so , we need to ask ourselves some questions .
Is everything okay ?
Is it okay to manipulate and create whatever creatures we want ?
Do we have free reign to design animals ?
It &apos;s already happening . It &apos;s not science fiction .
We are now taking control of our own evolution .
Thanks .
Péter Fankhauser : Meet Rezero , the dancing ballbot
Let me introduce to you Rezero .
Our robot belongs to a family of robots called Ballbots .
This means that the robot is inherently unstable .
Now we &apos;ll explain that in a second .
Let me first explain how Rezero actually keeps his balance .
Let &apos;s play a little .
In this mode , he &apos;s trying to maintain his position .
I can also make him spin .
He &apos;s now keeping a constant distance to Thomas .
We call this the orbiting mode .
All right , thank you , Thomas .
Now , what &apos;s the use of this technology ?
Rezero could be used in exhibitions or parks .
And these are more practical applications .
But there &apos;s also a certain beauty within this technology .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Do you know which group you &apos;re in ?
If you don &apos;t , you &apos;re not alone .
Because the breast has become are very political organ .
But first , my disclosures .
I am not a breast cancer survivor .
I &apos;m not a radiologist .
She came to see me after discovering a breast lump .
Her sister had been diagnosed with breast cancer in her 40s .
Fortunately , her lump proved to be benign .
Radiologists were outraged by the guidelines .
But in my view , the radiologists are heroes .
But that very fact is telling .
The factor most responsible for that fire is breast density .
And that proportion is primarily genetically determined .
So how do you know if your breasts are dense ?
And breasts that fall into these two categories are considered dense .
But what else could I offer her ?
What about ultrasound ?
Think about iPods compared to stereos .
But it &apos;s the exact opposite in health care .
The machines get ever bigger and ever more expensive .
It &apos;s just way too much equipment .
One MRI scan costs 10 times what a digital mammogram costs .
It &apos;s like the essence of TED .
This is an image from our first patient .
This is our current detector .
And you can see that it looks a lot different .
So how does this work ?
But with MBI , we use just light , pain-free compression .
And the detector then transmits the image to the computer .
So here &apos;s an example .
Our big break came in 2004 .
MBI found 83 percent .
Here &apos;s an example from that screening study .
In this case , a one-centimeter tumor .
So this is not just young women that it &apos;s benefiting .
It &apos;s also older women with dense tissue .
MBI generates four images per breast .
MRI generates over a thousand .
First , know your density .
Of course we should .
We need to individualize screening based on density .
For women without dense breasts , mammography is the best choice .
Thank you .
Pranav Mistry : The thrilling potential of SixthSense technology
We grew up interacting with the physical objects around us .
It comes as a part of our everyday learning .
It had some strings and pulleys and some springs .
What we are interested in is information .
We want to know about things .
We want to know about dynamic things going around .
The camera is actually tracking all your gestures .
You can start painting on any wall .
But we are not only tracking one finger , here .
Thank you .
This was Obama &apos;s visit last week to MIT .
But the camera is actually tracking where my fingers are moving .
You can of course watch movies .
And why only computers ? We can just play with papers .
Paper world is interesting to play with .
That &apos;s all . Thank you .
Thank you .
This is incredible , really .
Or is this research forever , or what ?
Open source ? Wow .
PM : Yeah . Yes , yes , of course .
What are your plans ? MIT ?
It &apos;s an honor to have you at TED .
Thank you so much .
That &apos;s fantastic .
Kevin Stone : The bio-future of joint replacement
So let me just start with my story .
And it &apos;s not just aging that causes arthritis .
Let &apos;s consider an alternative path .
I &apos;m not ready for joint replacement . &quot;
And &#91; the allograft &#93; replaces &#91; the missing meniscus &#93; .
And so we can regrow these surfaces biologically .
Well the reason is because there &apos;s not enough donor cycles .
And the tissue &apos;s very expensive .
So my story in working with animal tissues starts in 1984 .
And that &apos;s great when I can degrade the tissue .
I can &apos;t grind it up in a blender .
And we call that a &quot; gal stripping &quot; technique .
What we do is humanize the tissue .
So what about the next step ?
How are we going to revolutionize artificial joint replacement ?
Well here &apos;s how we &apos;re going to do it .
So that &apos;s our biologic approach right now .
We &apos;re going to rebuild your knee with the parts .
We &apos;re going to resurface it with a completely new surface .
But we have other advantages from the animal kingdom .
There &apos;s a benefit of 400 million years of ambulation .
We can harness those benefits .
We can do it as an outpatient procedure .
And so welcome to super biologics .
It &apos;s not hardware .
It &apos;s not software .
It &apos;s bioware .
It &apos;s version 2.0 of you .
Thank you very much .
Marcel Dicke : Why not eat insects ?
That &apos;s quite a lot .
Because there &apos;s 80 percent out there that really eats insects .
But this is quite good .
Why not eat insects ? Well first , what are insects ?
Insects are animals that walk around on six legs .
And here you see just a selection .
It was 80 billion U.S. dollars .
Well we know that that was not a cheap war .
What do they do ?
They remove dung , they pollinate our crops .
They control pests , and they &apos;re food for animals .
They &apos;re at the start of food chains .
Small animals eat insects .
Even larger animals eat insects .
There &apos;s quite a lot of people that are eating insects .
And they prepare it in a wonderful way .
And you can eat something new everyday .
More than 1,000 species -- an enormous variety .
You &apos;re eating at least 500 grams per year .
What are you eating ?
Some fruits get some insect damage .
And that &apos;s your view of a tomato .
So anything is a good protein source already .
We &apos;re even doing this on purpose .
One gram of cochineal costs about 30 euros .
One gram of gold is 30 euros .
The human population is growing very rapidly and is growing exponentially .
How are we going to feed this world ?
And we eat quite a lot of it .
In the developing world it &apos;s much lower .
It &apos;s 25 kilograms per person per year .
But it &apos;s increasing enormously .
They have the same share that we have .
You &apos;ll get proteins in any kind of food anyway .
The first problem that we &apos;re facing is human health .
Pigs are quite like us .
That means that pigs also share diseases with us .
You get a new disease that can be deadly .
So that &apos;s one point for insects .
And there &apos;s the conversion factor .
We &apos;re not taking the bonus yet .
We &apos;re not taking the nine kilograms of output yet .
So that &apos;s two points for insects .
And there &apos;s the environment .
So less waste .
So that &apos;s three points for insects .
And even in terms of calories , it is very good .
So that &apos;s four points for insects .
So the question is , why not eat insects ?
I gave you at least four arguments in favor .
We &apos;ll have to .
On the right-hand side you see a grasshopper .
It &apos;s just very good food .
You can vary enormously .
It has many benefits .
Who wouldn &apos;t like to eat a shrimp ?
They are delicacies .
So why are we not eating insects yet ?
Well that &apos;s just a matter of mindset .
That &apos;s why we &apos;re changing the perception of insects .
If we die out , the insects will continue very happily .
And some might think , well they &apos;re not yet available .
Well they are .
And they &apos;re being made in the most wonderful ways .
A Dutch chocolate maker .
So there &apos;s even a lot of design to it .
And when she got all the Ministers of Agriculture of the E.U.
It &apos;s not something that is a hobby of mine .
It &apos;s really taken off the ground .
So why not eat insects ?
You should try it yourself .
Look at them first . Look at them first .
Marcel Dicke : It &apos;s all protein .
And it looks delicious .
They just make it &#91; with &#93; nuts or something .
MD : Thank you .
Cameron Sinclair : The refugees of boom-and-bust
1.1 million of them .
They pay a middle-man thousands of dollars to be there .
And then the financial collapse happened .
Currently , right now , thousands of workers are abandoned .
There is no way back home .
And there is no way , and no proof of arrival .
These are the boom-and-bust refugees .
So let &apos;s forget your environmental footprint .
Let &apos;s think about your ethical footprint .
Thank you .
Kevin Surace : Eco-friendly drywall
What &apos;s happening to the climate ?
It is unbelievably bad .
So we all look at what we can do .
Only nine percent is passenger cars , interestingly enough .
So we ran off to a sushi bar .
And it was something called EcoRock .
We started R &amp; amp ; D in 2006 .
Decided to use recycled content from cement and steel manufacturing .
And they worked absolutely very , very , very hard .
We did the line install over the summer .
We started right there , with absolutely nothing .
That &apos;s the finished production line there .
We got our first panel out on December third .
But this has a huge , huge impact on the environment .
And we &apos;ve got Cradle-to-Cradle Gold on this thing .
Thank you . Thank you .
We must change everything .
We &apos;re going as fast as we can .
Those are my kids , Natalie and David .
Thank you so much .
Shigeru Ban : Emergency shelters made from paper
Hi . I am an architect .
Then I built the temporary structure , 1990 .
This is the first temporary building made out of paper .
So it &apos;s very useful .
Year 2000 , there was a big expo in Germany .
My goal of the design is not when it &apos;s completed .
After , the building was recycled .
So that was the goal of my design .
We stayed there for six years without paying any rent .
Thank you . I had one big problem .
That was the problem .
Then I completed the Pompidou Center in Metz .
They have money and power .
Those are invisible .
But I must say they are no longer natural disasters .
That &apos;s the responsibility of architects .
We can make it better .
So that is why I started working in disaster areas .
1994 , there was a big disaster in Rwanda , Africa .
Two tribes , Hutu and Tutsi , fought each other .
Over two million people became refugees .
But over two million people cut trees .
It just became big , heavy deforestation and an environmental problem .
That is why they started providing aluminum pipes , aluminum barracks .
And he said , &quot; Oh God , are you crazy ?
After a fire , what are you proposing ? &quot;
So I proposed to rebuild . I raised -- did fundraising .
The color coordination is very important .
So I remember it was so disappointing .
Finally the priest , finally he trusted me to rebuild .
So we spent five weeks rebuilding the church .
It stayed there in Taiwan as a permanent church even now .
So this building became a permanent building .
2001 , in West India , I built also a shelter .
I was asked to rebuild the temporary church .
I brought my Japanese students to work with the Chinese students .
And they are very kind , affording my model .
And I was very lucky .
But look at this . There &apos;s no privacy .
People suffer mentally and physically .
But it &apos;s really necessary to do it .
So I proposed to the mayor while I was making partitions .
Many of the people want to stay here forever .
I was very happy to hear that .
Now I am working in New Zealand , Christchurch .
And I was asked to come to rebuild the temporary cathedral .
So this is under construction .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Neil Burgess : How your brain tells you where you are
Here &apos;s the problem facing Homer .
Place cells are also being recorded in humans .
And when you expand the box , the firing location expands .
But we also know where we are through movement .
Do people have grid cells ?
So back to Homer .
And that would be represented by the firing of boundary-detecting cells .
Maybe it &apos;s been towed .
And grid cells could move this viewpoint through that space .
Thank you very much .
Nigel Marsh : How to make work-life balance work
We should stop looking outside .
I &apos;m talking about all companies .
Have sex .
Walk the dog .
Have breakfast with my wife and children .
Have sex again .
Drive the kids to school on the way to the office .
Do three hours &apos; work .
Play a sport with a friend at lunchtime .
Do another three hours &apos; work .
Meet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink .
Drive home for dinner with my wife and kids .
Meditate for half an hour .
Have sex .
Walk the dog . Have sex again .
Go to bed .
How often do you think I have that day ?
We need to be realistic .
You can &apos;t do it all in one day .
There &apos;s got to be a middle way .
And I realize that my life is completely out of balance .
It &apos;s totally dominated by work .
All of my relationships have failed .
There &apos;s nothing in my life apart from my work .
So I joined a gym . &quot;
Now that can be daunting .
And I understand .
I truly understand how that can be daunting .
Now my point is the small things matter .
Being more balanced doesn &apos;t mean dramatic upheaval in your life .
Moreover , I think , it can transform society .
And that , I think , is an idea worth spreading .
Sam Harris : Science can answer moral questions
&quot; What is worth dying for ? &quot;
&quot; What constitutes a good life ? &quot;
But I think this is quite clearly untrue .
Values are a certain kind of fact .
They are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures .
Why don &apos;t we feel compassion for rocks ?
Would adding cholera to the water be a good idea ?
Probably not .
And morality relates to these truths .
So , in talking about values we are talking about facts .
And these await our discovery .
We &apos;re not talking about Connecticut .
And the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious .
Well , consider by analogy , the concept of physical health .
The concept of physical health is undefined .
It &apos;s now around 80 in the developed world .
People will send you donations when you &apos;re in that condition .
Now , why wouldn &apos;t this undermine an objective morality ?
There is clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food .
But there &apos;s nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison .
Why would we think this ?
Consider , by analogy , the game of chess .
But it clearly admits some exceptions .
And yet , chess is a domain of perfect objectivity .
Well , who are we not to say this ?
What are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing ?
Now , what stands in the way of this ?
He likes chocolate , he likes vanilla .
Notice that we don &apos;t do this in science .
On the left you have Edward Witten .
He &apos;s a string theorist .
I &apos;m not a fan . &quot;
I &apos;m the Ted Bundy of string theory .
But this is just the point .
Whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded .
That is what it is to have a domain of expertise .
That is what it is for knowledge to count .
How have we convinced ourselves that every opinion has to count ?
Just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality .
Thank you very much .
So , some combustible material there .
Language seems to be really important here .
But can you reconcile that ?
So , everything is not going to be up for grabs .
Do people love their daughters just as much in these systems ?
And I think there are clearly right answers to that .
SH : Really an honor . Thank you .
Kathryn Schulz : On being wrong
My friend looks at me totally blankly .
And what I &apos;m talking about is this .
Right , the famous Chinese character for picnic area .
We get it in the abstract .
We all know everybody in this room makes mistakes .
I think this is a problem .
And second , why it &apos;s such a problem .
Dreadful . Thumbs down .
Embarrassing . Okay , wonderful , great .
But just being wrong doesn &apos;t feel like anything .
I &apos;ll give you an analogy .
That &apos;s when he falls .
So I should actually correct something I said a moment ago .
I call this error blindness .
Think back for a moment to elementary school .
This is not mine , by the way .
We learn these really bad lessons really well .
Right , Mr. CFO , astrophysicist , ultra-marathoner ?
Okay , so fine .
So let me tell you a story .
Beth Israel &apos;s in Boston .
Everything seems to have gone fine .
So this is a huge practical problem .
But it &apos;s also a huge social problem .
Think for a moment about what it means to feel right .
So this is a catastrophe .
And yeah , it is also why we get things wrong .
It &apos;s totally fundamental to who we are .
And my first thought was , &quot; I &apos;ve lost it .
I &apos;ve become the crazy wrongness lady .
I just imagined it everywhere , &quot; which has happened .
When it comes to our stories , we love being wrong .
And something else happened instead .
And something else happened instead .
And something else happened instead .
And something else happened instead .
I mean , this is life .
Didn &apos;t really work out that way , did it ?
Where &apos;s my jet pack , Chris ?
So here we are again .
And that &apos;s how it goes .
We come up with another idea .
We tell another story .
We hold another conference .
Maybe I &apos;m wrong . &quot;
Thank you .
Thank you guys .
Neil MacGregor : 2600 years of history in one object
It doesn &apos;t , I agree , look very much .
It &apos;s about the size of a rugby ball .
And you all know roughly the story .
Not only the Jews , he &apos;d taken the temple vessels .
He &apos;d ransacked , desecrated the temple .
Belshazzar , his son , decides to have a feast .
And Cyrus makes a declaration .
They &apos;re not shy of hyperbole as you can see .
So the hyperbole is not actually surprising .
He &apos;ll let them return to their countries .
It &apos;s a central document in Jewish history .
This is the Jewish version of the same story .
Who is there among you of his people ?
Two great texts , what about the politics ?
Cyrus begins in the 530s BC .
It was the largest empire the world had known until then .
And it had to be run in a quite new way .
It had to be run in different languages .
The fact that this decree is in Babylonian says one thing .
All of those are respected by Cyrus .
The Greek invasions ended that .
But what Cyrus represented remained absolutely central .
And throughout European culture afterward , Cyrus remained the model .
And it enters now another story .
No other evidence .
Suddenly , this appeared .
It &apos;s a great 19th century moment .
It can only be Jehovah .
The question is , which god was it ?
That &apos;s 1879 .
You all know what happened .
And another story of the cylinder begins .
Cyrus cylinder : guarantor of the Shah .
10 years later , another story : Iranian Revolution , 1979 .
Then another Iran-Iraq war .
And the obvious emblem is Cyrus .
It &apos;s the only object they want .
They want to borrow the Cyrus cylinder .
It was a huge event .
This is the other side of that same picture .
This is beyond any blockbuster exhibition in the West .
Is Iran still to be the defender of the oppressed ?
It was a narrative presented by the president himself .
It stands with the American constitution .
It certainly says far more about real freedoms than Magna Carta .
A replica of this is at the United Nations .
Thank you .
Joshua Klein : A thought experiment on the intelligence of crows
Any of you get really freaked out by that ?
You might want to leave now .
So , this is a vending machine for crows .
We gotta kill them because they &apos;re making a mess .
And he said that was impossible .
So I did .
They &apos;d become extremely adept at living with us .
And in doing so , we were breeding them for parasitism .
So , for example , rats are incredibly responsive breeders .
And so I built the vending machine .
We &apos;re seeing a population boom with crows .
So that &apos;s no great surprise .
And I &apos;ll give you an example of that .
So this is Betty . She &apos;s a New Caledonian crow .
But the researchers had a problem .
And she hadn &apos;t had the opportunity to do this before .
You see , it wasn &apos;t working very well .
So she adapted .
But she did it all on her own .
So keep in mind that she &apos;s never seen this done .
Right .
Yeah . All right .
That &apos;s the part where the researchers freak out .
It &apos;s pretty annoying for the fishermen .
And the next month . And after summer break .
So -- the moral being , don &apos;t piss off crows .
It &apos;s fairly interesting .
Wait for the light to stop the traffic .
Then , collect your cracked nut in safety .
Joshua Klein : Yeah , yeah . Pretty interesting .
In fact , that &apos;s old hat for crows .
Parents seem to be teaching their young .
The point being that they &apos;ve developed cultural adaptation .
So we know that there &apos;s lots of crows .
So that &apos;s what we did .
This is a vending machine for crows .
It &apos;s pretty simple .
And eventually , they eat up all the peanuts .
Then you can come back anytime and get yourself a peanut .
And so this goes on for some time .
Come back , look for the peanut , go away .
They figure it &apos;s gotta have more to it .
And then , we &apos;re off to the races .
Instead , I think we should look a little bit larger .
I think that crows can be trained to do other things .
Or find expensive components from discarded electronics ?
Or maybe do search and rescue ?
Thanks very much .
David Logan : Tribal leadership
Now , I want to tell you a quick story .
We &apos;ll go back a little more than a year .
It was February 3rd , 2008 .
Anyone remember what happened , February 3rd , 2008 ?
And they had discussed things of great national importance .
Like , &quot; Do we like the Budweiser commercial ? &quot;
All of you are members of tribes .
That is in fact what great tribal leaders do .
So here is the bottom line .
And so people form tribes .
They always have . They always will .
But here &apos;s the rub .
Now here is the net out of this .
You &apos;re all a member of tribes .
Now , this is the lowest of the stages .
You don &apos;t want this . Okay ?
Stage One produces people who do horrible things .
This is the kid who shot up Virginia Tech .
It &apos;s not enough to simply write people off .
But let &apos;s move on to Stage Two .
It will be despairing hostility .
Actually , no , I &apos;m not .
But I &apos;m saying the culture makes people dumb .
You find them in all places in society .
What kind of innovation would get done ?
The amount of world-changing behavior that would happen ?
In fact it would be basically nil .
Because it is in Stage Three that many of us move .
And we park . And we stay .
I &apos;m great and you &apos;re not .
And the elevator door opened , and they all walked out .
That is a meeting of a Stage Three tribe .
Like , oh , I don &apos;t know , TEDx USC .
Here is the greatest challenge we face in innovation .
It is moving from Stage Three to Stage Four .
Let &apos;s take a look at a quick video snippet .
It was not Christmas time . There was a Christmas tree .
This is their lobby .
Employees volunteer time in the advice booth .
Notice it looks like something out of a Peanuts cartoon .
Okay , we &apos;re going through the hallway here at Zappos .
This is a call center . Notice how it &apos;s decorated .
Notice people are applauding for us .
But you &apos;ll notice the level of excitement .
Notice , again , how they decorate their office .
But they value things like fun . And they value creativity .
And you &apos;ll notice they are a little bit weird .
Stage Four tribes can do remarkable things .
There is , in fact , another stage .
In fact , South Africa has not gone down that road .
We &apos;re great ! Who is not great ? England ! &quot;
Sorry .
Well , what about other great leaders ? What about Gandhi ?
What about Martin Luther King ?
Just one little bit of happiness and joy after another .
Two percent are at Stage One .
And our values are beginning to unite us . &quot;
And those are the ones that change the world .
I &apos;d like to show you some examples of this .
And he grew up essentially in Stage One .
I don &apos;t know anybody .
In fact , that &apos;s progress .
So , what about moving from Stage Three to Stage Four ?
I want to argue that we &apos;re doing that right here .
That &apos;s called a triadic relationship .
See , people who build world-changing tribes do that .
And ultimately that adds to their values .
You know they do polls , right ?
Pretty much everybody else who does polls .
So , they were bored .
And they found a way to do the first-ever world poll .
Incidentally , they did pull it off .
And they released the first-ever world poll .
So I &apos;d like to leave you with these thoughts .
You remember to talk all five culture stages .
Because we &apos;ve got people in all five , around us .
Thank you very much .
Frederick Balagadde : Bio-lab on a microchip
This is the most devastating epidemic of our time .
This is already beginning to happen in Sub-Saharan Africa .
I experienced this firsthand as a high school student in Uganda .
We all know about the miracle of miniaturization .
This is a microfluidic chip that I developed .
Thank you very much .
Jonathan Drori : The beautiful tricks of flowers
Do you know how many species of flowering plants there are ?
And flowers are a real bugger .
They &apos;re really difficult for plants to produce .
Why would they go to that bother ?
Evolution works that way .
Now the way that plants transmit that information is through pollen .
Some of you may have seen some of these pictures before .
And that &apos;s actually rather useful for forensics and so on .
There are markings on many plants that look like other insects .
And they get up to all sorts of tricks .
They have to try and attract pollinators to do their bidding .
And sure enough , there &apos;s the insect .
Now this is a plant .
And this is the mimic .
So this is a plant that is mimicking the first plant .
Now deceit carries on through the plant kingdom .
Sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect , even to us .
It &apos;s a wonderful , amazing thing .
This one &apos;s clever . It &apos;s called obsidian .
I think of it as insidium sometimes .
And this one doesn &apos;t have anything for them .
So it &apos;s deceiving on two levels -- fabulous .
Here we see ylang ylang , the component of many perfumes .
I actually smelt someone with some on earlier .
And the flowers don &apos;t really have to be that gaudy .
This one doesn &apos;t smell so good .
So flies love this .
They fly in and they pollinate .
It &apos;s really horrible .
And blowflies just can &apos;t help themselves .
I photographed this thing last week in Dorset .
This is the philodendron selloum .
This is the most amazing thing .
That sort of phallic bit there is about a foot long .
This thing does something else which is unusual .
There &apos;s a thermoregulation mechanism in there that keeps constant temperature .
And they get inside , and they get it all on .
And what a wonderful thing it is .
So there &apos;s something that goes on off the end there .
Well yes we can .
So what is an insect seeing ?
And this is what it looks like with visible light .
Most bees don &apos;t perceive red .
And that &apos;s a real fantastic bull &apos;s eye .
So maybe the chemical in that would be useful .
And I love the idea of something hidden .
That &apos;s the main use of that filter .
Thank you very much .
Srdja Popovic : How to topple a dictator
Good afternoon . I am proud to be here at TEDxKrakow .
Here it is . It is December 15 , 2010 .
But you need to share it with the world . Okay ?
Curiosity killed the cat . You take the bet .
Next thing you know , two guys in white appear .
Well , people power has been there for a while .
It helped Gandhi kick the Brits from India .
It helped Martin Luther King win a historic racial struggle .
If this is true , we can help these movements .
Well , first one , analytic skills .
What is the average age of Egyptians ? 24 .
How long was Mubarak in power ? 31 .
It seems that Generation Epsilon is coming .
Now let me set another example .
And , I mean , there is a set of conditions .
Let me give you the example .
I am coming from a country called Serbia .
Guess what ? That was the day of his defeat .
They appear on the street only with the flag of Egypt .
I will give you a counter-example .
You see nine presidential candidates running against Lukashenko .
You will know the outcome .
That thing doesn &apos;t exist in the world .
If you maintain nonviolent discipline , you will exclusively win .
One single act of violence can literally destroy your movement .
Now let me move to another place .
It &apos;s selection of strategies and tactics .
There are certain rules in nonviolent struggle you may follow .
First , you start small .
Second , you pick the battles you can win .
It &apos;s only 200 of us in this room .
We won &apos;t call for the March of Millions .
They &apos;re very useful in a violent oppression .
So it works like in a video game .
You have a fear high , you have status quo .
You have enthusiasm higher , you see fear starting to melt .
In Egypt , you can tell that something is happening there .
Well , that &apos;s just the beginning of the show .
The real show starts when the police appears .
We are three blocks away observing it from our espresso bar .
Arrest the shoppers with kids ? Doesn &apos;t make sense .
When you start to mock them , it hurts .
Don &apos;t mix tools with the substance .
But here is also the bad news .
Are they going to become the world wave ?
This is the difference between two towns .
Now , what &#91; do &#93; the statistics have ?
This is one more reason to look at this phenomenon .
Thank you .
Gordon Brown : Wiring a web for global good
This is Tiananmen Square .
And what do all these pictures and events have in common ?
They protested across Britain .
They won public opinion over a long period of time .
But it took 24 years for the campaign to be successful .
Now look at what &apos;s happened in the last 10 years .
200 years ago the problem we had to solve was slavery .
My husband too has spent a long time in prison . &quot;
We cannot solve these problems unless we work together .
Take the financial crisis .
I have just been talking to the President of Sierra Leone .
There is a photograph of a boy called David .
Beside that photograph there is the information about his life .
It said &quot; David , age 10 . &quot;
David : ambition to be a doctor .
Favorite sport : football . What did he enjoy most ?
Making people laugh .
How did he die ?
Tortured to death .
And we never did .
So my argument today is basically this .
They said , &quot; Let &apos;s march . &quot;
We should be marching towards a global society .
Thank you .
Oliver Sacks : What hallucination reveals about our minds
And seeing with the brain is often called imagination .
They don &apos;t seem to be of our creation .
They don &apos;t seem to be under our control .
I went in to see her .
So I said , &quot; What sort of things ? &quot;
A man who turns towards me and smiles .
But he has huge teeth on one side of his mouth .
Animals too .
Then , one night , the scene changes .
I see cats and dogs walking towards me .
They come to a certain point and then stop .
Then it changes again .
I said , &quot; Is this like a dream ? &quot;
But it &apos;s completely silent , like a silent movie . &quot;
And she said that it &apos;s a rather boring movie .
And she has a sense of humor .
She knew it was a hallucination .
She had no control over them .
And she didn &apos;t know what was going on .
She wondered if she was going mad or losing her mind .
Well , I examined her carefully .
She wasn &apos;t on any medications which could produce hallucinations .
But she was blind .
And you have Charles Bonnet syndrome .
You have Charles Bonnet syndrome . &quot;
She said , &quot; Who is this Charles Bonnet ? &quot;
She said , &quot; Did he have them himself ? &quot;
Well , so I did tell the nurses .
Now this , for me , is a common situation .
I work in old-age homes , largely .
About 10 percent of the hearing impaired people get musical hallucinations .
His grandfather had these hallucinations .
His grandfather was a magistrate , an elderly man .
He &apos;d had cataract surgery .
His vision was pretty poor .
It was a large blue handkerchief with four orange circles .
And he knew it was a hallucination .
You don &apos;t have handkerchiefs in midair .
And then he saw a big wheel in midair .
And then the handsome young men disappeared .
They don &apos;t usually fade in and out .
They are rather sudden , and they change suddenly .
That was the only figure he recognized .
This repetition of perception is sometimes called palinopsia .
And you start to see things .
The things you see can be very complicated indeed .
She had very mobile hallucinations as well .
A lot of them had to do with a car .
Another patient of mine had a different sort of hallucination .
And , above all , she would see cartoons .
And especially she saw cartoons of Kermit the Frog .
You know , I was wondering about Freudian determinants .
Why Kermit ?
Kermit the Frog means nothing to me . &quot;
She didn &apos;t mind the cartoons too much .
And these frightened her .
Well , what is going on with these people ?
They seduce you . They humiliate you .
They jeer at you .
You interact with them .
You &apos;re at a particular road junction .
You smell chestnuts roasting .
You hear the traffic . All the senses are involved .
And you &apos;re waiting for your girl .
And it &apos;s that Tuesday evening back in 1982 .
The Charles Bonnet ones are quite different .
And one of the second commonest is cartoons .
So , what is going on ?
You don &apos;t form images with your primary visual cortex .
It &apos;s very interesting that that should be specific .
&quot; Face cells &quot; were discovered around 1970 .
I saw an Aston Martin this morning .
I had to bring it in .
And now it &apos;s in there somewhere .
Suddenly this , and suddenly that .
&quot; Kermit means nothing to me . &quot;
You don &apos;t get anywhere thinking of them as dreams .
Well , I &apos;ve more or less said what I wanted .
Think of the number of blind people .
Thanks very much .
That was superb . Thank you so much .
Have you yourself experienced any of the syndromes you write about ?
Oliver Sacks : I was afraid you &apos;d ask that .
Well , yeah , a lot of them .
And actually I &apos;m a little visually impaired myself .
And I see the geometrical hallucinations .
But they stop there .
And they don &apos;t disturb you ?
That was an utterly , utterly fascinating talk .
Thank you so much for sharing .
OS : Thank you . Thank you .
Bart Weetjens : How I taught rats to sniff out land mines
As a child , I had two passions .
One was a passion for rodents .
I also had a passion for Africa .
Africa was truly fascinating for me .
We &apos;re talking &apos; 95 now .
We chose rats .
Why would you choose rats ?
Because , aren &apos;t they vermin ?
And actually , our product -- what you see here .
There &apos;s a target somewhere here .
There , the animal finds a mine .
It scratches on the soil .
And the animal comes back for a food reward .
Very , very simple .
Very sustainable in this environment .
Here , the animal gets its food reward .
And that &apos;s how it works .
Very , very simple .
Now why would you use rats ?
They &apos;re extremely sensitive to smell .
Now how do we communicate with rats ?
This consists of 400 square meters .
Question of scale .
We have a demonstration site in Mozambique .
But let me bring you to a very different problem .
You can actually cure T.B. , even in HIV-positives .
So in our common language , Dutch , the name for T.B.
So how does it work ?
You have a cassette with 10 samples .
You put these 10 samples at once in the cage .
Here it &apos;s already at the third sample .
This is a positive sample .
It gets a click sound and comes for the food reward .
But let &apos;s stick first to tuberculosis .
Microscopy for 1,800 patients .
So this is really considerable .
At least our hero rats have saved lots of lives .
The way forward for us is now to standardize this technology .
So , to standardize this .
To conclude , there are also other applications at the horizon .
This is in a prototype stage .
We don &apos;t have a working system here yet .
Thank you very much .
Amy Tan : Where does creativity hide ?
The Value of Nothing : Out of Nothing Comes Something .
OK .
And I had a miniature poodle .
Everything except randomness . She did not believe in randomness .
There was a reason for everything .
You become very creative , in a survival sense .
And this , then , led to my big questions .
And they &apos;re the same ones that I have today .
And this happens constantly in the writing .
You won &apos;t discover anything .
And they all operate at the same time .
There is also a big question of ambiguity .
And I would link that to something called the cosmological constant .
A very famous Chinese saying , she said .
And then we have intentions .
What are we supposed to do ?
I got these hints everywhere .
And what I need , in effect , is a focus .
And when I have the question , it is a focus .
And it seems like it &apos;s happening all the time .
And you are noticing it more often .
But you apply this .
Why or why not ?
This leads to this question .
It seems so obvious , and yet it is not .
Sometimes I get help from the universe , it seems .
And I needed to find something historically that would match that .
You wonder , are these things random chance ?
And that goes into the story , too .
A big thing that I also think about is accidents .
What is the nature of accidents ?
60 homes were destroyed , and 40 were damaged .
Responsibility was assigned to the family .
It &apos;s the son , not the father . &quot;
And so I was there on three occasions , different seasons .
And how do I create my own life ?
So , there are never complete answers .
There she is .
Thank you very much !
Andrew Fitzgerald : Adventures in Twitter fiction
But I want to start and go back to the 1930s .
And from those single points emanated stories .
Some of them were familiar stories .
Some of them were new stories .
Think about episodes that happened live on radio .
There are thousands upon thousands of them .
Every single one of these points is its own broadcaster .
I believe this starts with an evolution of existing methods .
He was able to write and publish in relatively short order .
There was no mediator between him and the audience .
So this whole project was an experiment .
It was originally written specifically with Twitter in mind .
Now Twitter , of course , has a 140-character limit .
I think that &apos;s pretty exciting : tune-in literary fiction .
when this woman falls to her death .
These three characters brought an authentic vision from multiple perspectives .
It was also Twitter as a production mechanism .
All of these are rapid iterations on a theme .
Keep in mind , they &apos;re all Democrats .
And they engage with the real world .
They respond to it .
So during the Chicago mayoral election there was a parody account .
It was Mayor Emanuel .
I double checked the newspapers .
And then , very interestingly , it came to an end .
It ended , a true narrative conclusion .
And I think this is an interesting experiment in format .
In this particular case , he &apos;s talking about drone strikes .
Thank you .
Rachelle Garniez : &quot; La Vie en Rose &quot;
Catherine Bracy : Why good hackers make good citizens
I &apos;m going to talk about hackers .
It &apos;s about critical thinking .
It &apos;s about questioning existing ways of doing things .
And in many ways , hacking is what built America .
Betsy Ross was a hacker .
The Underground Railroad was a brilliant hack .
So keep that in mind .
All of you are potential civic hackers .
So what does civic hacking look like ?
They asked citizens to write the content .
So you &apos;ve heard of a hack-a-thon .
I authored this answer , and a few others .
They actually love it .
And the contract was a two-year contract for 9.3 million dollars .
They can actually build government .
We have 31 brigades in the U.S.
So please come hack with us .
Thank you .
Ananda Shankar Jayant : Fighting cancer with dance
I heard the word &quot; carcinoma . &quot;
Yes , breast cancer .
I thought I knew what fear was .
That day , I learned what fear was .
Is this the end of my dance ? &quot;
I needed something that would pull me out of all this .
But it wasn &apos;t easy .
Believe me , it definitely wasn &apos;t easy .
All I wanted to do was curl up and weep .
It was excruciatingly painful , but I did it .
Difficult .
But I needed something else .
The metaphor of Mahishasura Mardhini , of Durga .
Durga , the epitome of creative feminine energy , or shakti .
Durga , the fearless one .
Yes , cancer has just been one page in my life .
My story is the power of thought .
My story is the power of choice .
It &apos;s the power of focus .
My story is the power of a metaphor .
It &apos;s the power of an image .
Mine was that of Durga , Durga the fearless one .
Thomas Dolby : &quot; Love Is a Loaded Pistol &quot;
And that was largely because there weren &apos;t any .
And I can light up the Nutmeg like a beacon .
It &apos;s about Billie Holiday .
But I know where she was .
She was with me on my lifeboat .
And she was hot .
Jeremy Gilley : One day of peace
And when I was 12 , I became an actor .
I was told I was dyslexic .
In fact , I have got qualifications .
And so concern is where all of this comes from .
And then I thought , well maybe I could do something .
Maybe I could become a filmmaker .
Maybe there &apos;s a little change I can get involved in .
Because it &apos;s obviously incredibly frightening .
And that was when I had the idea .
There was no starting point for peace .
There was no day of global unity .
There was no day of intercultural cooperation .
So obviously we didn &apos;t have any money .
I was living at my mom &apos;s place .
And we started writing letters to everybody .
He was a prisoner of war .
He saw the bomb go off at Nagasaki .
It poisoned his blood . He died when I was 11 .
So he was like my hero .
And very quickly , some letters started coming back .
And we started to build this case .
And I remember the first letter .
One of the first letters was from the Dalai Lama .
And we didn &apos;t have money for the flight .
And then Dr. Oscar Arias came forward .
And we invited everybody , and no press showed up .
And that was kind of like the launch of this thing .
For me , it was really about the process .
It wasn &apos;t about the end result .
And that &apos;s the beautiful thing about the camera .
So anyway , we began the journey .
Yeah , I &apos;m not worried about it now .
76 countries in the last 12 years , I &apos;ve visited .
I &apos;ve recorded 44,000 young people .
I &apos;ve recorded about 900 hours of their thoughts .
And we were listening to everybody .
And it was an incredibly thing , working with the U.N.
and working with NGOs and building this case .
I don &apos;t know how to get involved in that process .
And thank you to all of them .
That was an incredible moment .
And suddenly , we started to institutionalize this day .
And it was 8 : 00 AM when I stood there .
It never happened .
And we have to make this day work .
It &apos;s been created ; nobody knows .
And I left New York freaked , but actually empowered .
I remember putting that film out and going to cynics .
It &apos;s just symbolism .
Children can lead their projects .
That &apos;s what I &apos;d heard .
And so I went back to the United Nations .
I decided that I &apos;d continue filming and make another movie .
And then UNAMA became involved in Afghanistan .
I won &apos;t go into that .
It &apos;d be really interesting if you came .
It would help and bring attention .
I think there &apos;s a number of pillars to success .
One is you &apos;ve got to have a great idea .
So these guys were absolutely crucial .
So he said yes , and we found ourselves in Afghanistan .
There was an interest in what was going on .
And her Afghan network was just absolutely everywhere .
And she was really crucial in getting the message in .
We had to wait now and see what happened .
We will observe this day .
We see it as a window of opportunity .
And we gave the film over .
Obviously it was shown , and it was amazing .
They were saying they would stop .
70 percent reduction in violence on this day at least .
And that completely blew my mind almost more than anything .
And I was there thinking about what was going on .
And I kept thinking about this 70 percent .
We have to go for a global truce .
That &apos;s exactly what we must do .
And you can see the education box there .
And obviously the life-saving is increased , the concepts help .
Ultimately , that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . &quot;
We &apos;ll make a new film about this process .
We &apos;ll utilize sport and football .
So , utilizing all of these ways to inspire individual action .
And ultimately , we have to try that .
We have to work together .
I was with Brahimi , Ambassador Brahimi .
He &apos;s an amazing man .
And I sat with him a few weeks ago .
He said , &quot; It &apos;s absolutely possible . &quot;
I said , &quot; What would you do ?
It &apos;s all about the individuals .
It &apos;s all about you and me .
It &apos;s all about partnerships .
It &apos;s about your constituencies ; it &apos;s about your businesses .
By working together , we can create peace one day .
Thank you TED . Thank you .
Thank you .
Thanks a lot .
Thank you very much . Thank you .
&quot; A lesbian girl . &quot;
I know you know a lot of endocrinology . &quot;
This wasn &apos;t rocket science .
And so he did .
Right ?
Does this make so-and-so straight ?
I was getting sexual orientation confused with gender identity .
And the data show it .
So what to do ?
And they fall apart .
That &apos;s how good it can be .
They look normal . They had normal heights .
in a crowd .
Well , where were these kids before ?
They were out there suffering , is where they were .
So we started a program in 2007 .
And since then , we have 160 patients .
Did they come from Afghanistan ? No .
And some came from England .
Jackie had been abused in the Midlands , in England .
It was a horror show .
They had to homeschool her .
And yet , she had just begun a male puberty .
And so here she is at 16 , on the left .
They will do it at 18 now .
And on the far right , there she is .
She went public , semifinalist in the Miss England competition .
The judges debated as to , can they do this ?
And she &apos;s become a remarkable spokeswoman .
Go figure .
So this picture , I think , says it all .
It really says it all .
He &apos;s got a prominent Adam &apos;s apple .
Now Nicole is on estrogen .
She has a bit of a form to her .
And then they finally got it .
So where do we go from here ?
We need less expensive drugs .
They cost a fortune .
And we need to get this condition out of the DSM .
And this isn &apos;t going to break anybody &apos;s budget .
This is not that common .
Thank you .
Melinda Gates : What nonprofits can learn from Coca-Cola
Coke is everywhere .
And I &apos;m not the first person to ask this question .
It &apos;s staggering , if you think about Coca-Cola .
They sell 1.5 billion servings every single day .
So why does this matter ?
So let &apos;s start with the data .
They have this very continuous feedback loop .
They have a whole team called &quot; Knowledge and Insight . &quot;
It &apos;s a lot like other consumer companies .
Let &apos;s contrast that for a minute to development .
Real-time data turns on the lights .
So what &apos;s the second thing that Coke &apos;s good at ?
They &apos;re good at tapping into that local entrepreneurial talent .
Let &apos;s look at the development side .
What is it that governments and NGOs can learn from Coke ?
Now , think about how this can change people &apos;s lives .
So what &apos;s the next step for Ethiopia ?
Well , they &apos;re already starting talk about this .
The third component of Coke &apos;s success is marketing .
Well , it &apos;s aspirational .
Coke &apos;s global campaign slogan is &quot; Open Happiness . &quot;
But they localize it .
Now , that played itself out in the World Cup campaign .
So how does health and development market ?
Well , it &apos;s based on avoidance , not aspirations .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ve heard some of these messages .
&quot; Use a condom , don &apos;t get AIDS . &quot;
&quot; Wash you hands , you might not get diarrhea . &quot;
And I think that &apos;s a mistake .
One example is sanitation .
But there &apos;s a solution : you build a toilet .
People reuse it for a slab for their home .
They sometimes store grain in it .
I &apos;ve even seen it used for a chicken coop .
Well , you work with the community .
And it works -- look at these headlines .
I &apos;m not kidding .
Women are refusing to marry men without toilets .
No loo , no &quot; I do . &quot;
But more importantly , it saves lives .
And can you guess what the young men are waiting for ?
They &apos;re waiting to be circumcised .
Can you you believe that ?
Well , why is all of this so important ?
In 2009 , we &apos;re down to 1,600 cases .
Well how did that happen ?
Let &apos;s look at a country like India .
They have two and a half million vaccinators .
Now it could have come from one of two places .
So many more people would have been affected .
So what &apos;s the endgame ?
It &apos;s not the marketing on the ground .
We have a problem with marketing in the donor community .
And we are so close .
And this victory is so possible .
To me , that is deep happiness .
Thank you .
JoAnn Kuchera-Morin : Stunning data visualization in the AlloSphere
Our scientist colleagues are finding new patterns in the information .
This first project is called the AlloBrain .
You &apos;re flying through the cortex of my colleague &apos;s brain .
They &apos;re mining blood density levels .
And they &apos;re reporting them back to you sonically .
You view the bond in the triangle .
We think it makes a beautiful structural art .
Oxygen , hydrogen and zinc have their own signature .
And you &apos;re going to hear an undulation between the sound .
This is actually a light emitter .
They &apos;re starting to find new mathematical structures in these calculations .
And they &apos;re understanding more about quantum mathematics .
This will be the final project that I show you .
You &apos;re actually seeing and hearing quantum information flow .
Thank you very much .
Ben Saunders : Why bother leaving the house ?
I &apos;m usually introduced as a polar explorer .
The pithiest answer to the question &quot; why ? &quot;
Now I &apos;m not actually sure that he did say that .
There is not the slightest prospect of any gain whatsoever .
We don &apos;t live to eat and make money .
We eat and make money to be able to enjoy life .
There was a bit of fun , a bit of joy .
And that journey lasted 10 weeks , 72 days .
Beyond that , I didn &apos;t see anyone for 10 weeks .
NASA described conditions that year as the worst since records began .
And I would add a cautionary note here , however .
Many of you will know the story .
This is a photo of Captain Scott and his team .
Is there a chance you &apos;ll see her there ? &quot;
But Scott &apos;s journey remains unfinished .
So that &apos;s precisely what I &apos;m setting out to do .
We have to turn around and come back again .
Thank you very much .
Tal Golesworthy : How I repaired my own heart
I &apos;m a process engineer .
This is an inherited disorder .
Everyone in here will be between 3.2 and 3.6 cm .
I was already up at 4.4 .
The thought of the surgery was not attractive .
The thought of the warfarin was really quite frightening .
I can do this . I can change this .
The project aim is really quite simple .
So the possibility exists to simply externally wrap the pipe .
And it would remain stable and operate quite happily .
So where do we start ?
Well this is a sagittal slice through me .
This is a model of my aorta .
You can see , it &apos;s quite a complex structure .
So it &apos;s quite a difficult structure to produce .
So this is absolutely personalized medicine at its best really .
Every patient we do has an absolutely bespoke implant .
Once you &apos;ve made it , the installation &apos;s quite easy .
Happy , away I went .
So the surgical implantation actually was the easiest part .
No breaking into your circulatory system .
So it really is great .
And even worse , it inevitably foreshortens your life .
Well the answer to that is a multidisciplinary team .
This is a list of the core team .
Jargon is a big one .
The engineers amongst you will recognize rapid prototyping and CAD .
Our disciplinary conventions were funny as well .
In the medical world they look up at plans .
So the horizontal images were all an inversion .
So one needs to be careful with disciplinary conventions .
Institutional barriers were another serious headache in the project .
I &apos;m sure it &apos;s the same in Poland .
And they made extra problems for us .
You &apos;ll have an equivalent in Poland , no doubt .
We had to get past the NICE problem .
We now have a great clinical guidance out on the Net .
Funding barriers : Another big area to be concerned with .
It must be rubbish . They binned it .
I &apos;ve coined a phrase &quot; obstructive conservatism . &quot;
They don &apos;t want to change .
They simply want to do whatever they &apos;ve done before .
And in fact , there are many surgeons in the U.K.
We &apos;ve actually got 30 patients .
I &apos;m at seven and a half years .
It really is a problem . It really is a problem .
You &apos;ve got to express support for them .
Tom Treasure , professor of cardiothoracic surgery : incredible guy .
Dead easy to give him respect .
Him giving me respect ? Slightly different .
That &apos;s all the bad news .
The good news is the benefits are stonkingly huge .
Translate that one . I bet they can &apos;t .
So Heather &apos;s going to like me .
Mark Bittman : What &apos;s wrong with what we eat
I write about food . I write about cooking .
Now , that is only a little bit hyperbolic .
And why do I say it ?
There was the bomb , and there &apos;s now .
Then hear this , please .
There &apos;s more .
And that &apos;s the direct result of eating a Western diet .
Now global warming was unforeseen .
It &apos;s not the beta-carotene , it &apos;s the carrot .
The evidence is very clear that plants promote health .
This evidence is overwhelming at this point .
Not bad .
But back to animals and junk food .
What do they have in common ?
One : we don &apos;t need either of them for health .
Two : both have been marketed heavily , creating unnatural demand .
We &apos;re not born craving Whoppers or Skittles .
Now , let &apos;s imagine a parallel .
Incredible , isn &apos;t it ?
Yet they do that .
And they do this here . It &apos;s the same deal .
But industry lobbyists would never let that happen .
And guess what ?
Now , don &apos;t get me wrong .
That &apos;s our number . 10 billion .
That &apos;s just the United States .
Seriously .
They both get it wrong , though .
A hundred years ago , guess what ?
Every family had a cook , usually a mom .
And those moms bought and prepared food .
It was like your romantic vision of Europe .
Margarine didn &apos;t exist .
There were no restaurant chains .
Eating ethnic was unheard of unless you were ethnic .
And fancy food was entirely French .
You just ate .
You didn &apos;t claim to be anything .
There was no marketing . There were no national brands .
Vitamins had not been invented .
You ate food .
The cornflake hadn &apos;t been invented .
Goldfish swam .
And again , everyone ate local .
Oranges became common in New York .
The effects of this are well known . They are everywhere .
Thus arrived convenience .
Who needed it though ? Meat was everywhere .
But by then cattle were already raised unnaturally .
New drugs kept them healthy .
Well , they kept them alive .
Healthy was another story .
And chicken soon joined them on the throne .
Meat consumption increased five-fold .
And this took care of the situation resoundingly .
Not that they were any good , but they were there .
For dessert , store-bought ice cream or cookies .
It wasn &apos;t all bad .
We weren &apos;t all hippies , either .
Meanwhile , food production had become industrial . Industrial .
Many people became fat-phobic .
Others worshiped broccoli , as if it were God-like .
But mostly they didn &apos;t eat broccoli .
Similarly , let &apos;s look at a granola bar .
Think of the frozen chicken nugget .
All you do is nuke it . What could be better ?
And zapped horribly , pathetically .
Leading the way -- what &apos;s leading the way ?
So , now we clamor for organic food .
That &apos;s good .
Let me pose you a question .
I don &apos;t know .
Now here is where we all meet .
We need to start acting .
How much livestock do you need to produce this ?
But don &apos;t we need meat to be big and strong ?
Isn &apos;t meat eating essential to health ?
Some of us might think that would be a good thing .
Ann Cooper &apos;s right .
The USDA is not our ally here .
And that happens to be quite easy .
Less meat , less junk , more plants .
It &apos;s a simple formula : eat food .
Eat real food .
We &apos;ll reduce not only calories , but our carbon footprint .
We have to choose that path .
Thank you .
David Hanson : Robots that &quot; show emotion &quot;
There he &apos;s starting to walk .
This is at the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology .
I built the head . They built the body .
It also recognizes where you &apos;re looking , your head orientation .
Okay . So I &apos;m smiling .
Now I &apos;m frowning .
And this is really heavily backlit .
Okay , here we go .
Oh , it &apos;s so sad .
Okay , so you smile , frowning .
Machines are becoming devastatingly capable of things like killing . Right ?
Those machines have no place for empathy .
And there is billions of dollars being spent on that .
So , we &apos;re involving two things .
You start to believe that it &apos;s alive and aware .
which was the basis of the movie &quot; Bladerunner . &quot;
And we &apos;re getting this mass-manufactured .
Interfacing with the Internet , it gets smarter over the years .
As artificial intelligence evolves , so does his intelligence .
Thank you so much . That &apos;s incredible .
Gever Tulley : Life lessons through tinkering
We &apos;re not trying to teach anybody any specific thing .
It &apos;s a six-day immersive experience for the kids .
Nothing ever turns out as planned ... ever .
We start from doodles and sketches .
And sometimes we make real plans .
And sometimes we just start building .
Problems become puzzles and obstacles disappear .
Decoration of the unfinished project is a kind of conceptual incubation .
All materials are available for use .
And the things that they build amaze even themselves .
Three , two , one , go !
Gever Tulley : A rollercoaster built by seven-year-olds .
Yay !
GT : Thank you . It &apos;s been a great pleasure .
Marco Tempest : Augmented reality , techno-magic
So magic is a very introverted field .
That &apos;s true even amongst peers .
Now my own speciality is combining digital technology and magic .
Could we bring down the lights please ? Thank you .
So let &apos;s give this a try .
Terribly sorry . I forgot the floor .
Wake up .
Hey .
Come on .
Please .
Come on .
Ah , sorry about that .
Forgot this .
Give it another try .
Okay .
He figured out the system .
Uh oh .
All right . Let &apos;s try this .
Come on .
Hey .
You heard her , go ahead .
Bye-bye .
Jackson Browne : A song inspired by the ocean
Thank you .
Majora Carter : Greening the ghetto
We garnered much support along the way .
One out of four South Bronx children has asthma .
These impacts are coming everyone &apos;s way .
Good .
Yeah , I &apos;m a poor black child from the ghetto .
These things make me different from you .
So how did things get so different for us ?
My dad was not alone .
A national highway construction boom was added to our problems .
600,000 people were displaced .
Now , why is this story important ?
Are these factors taken into consideration when land-use policy is decided ?
What costs are associated with these decisions ? And who pays ?
Think bike shops , juice stands .
We secured 20 million dollars to build first-phase projects .
Even during rush hour , it goes virtually unused .
Green roofs are soil and living plants .
And they provide habitats for our little friends !
So -- -- so cool !
I like that , too .
It &apos;s better to ask for forgiveness than permission .
In the post-Katrina era , we have still more in common .
We are more than simply national symbols of urban blight .
But I &apos;ll tell you later if you want to know .
At present , that &apos;s not happening in New York City .
And we are operating with a comprehensive urban planning deficit .
Now let &apos;s get this straight . I am not anti-development .
So I don &apos;t have a problem with developers making money .
This is my version of globalization .
He looked at the demographics .
For his brilliant efforts , he was nearly impeached .
We have no excuse in this country . I &apos;m sorry .
But Bogota &apos;s example has the power to change that .
You , however , are blessed with the gift of influence .
Use your influence in support of comprehensive sustainable change everywhere .
Make it a part of your dinner and cocktail conversations .
Help me fight for environmental and economic justice .
Support investments with a triple-bottom-line return .
Oh good , glad I have a little more time !
His response was a grant program .
I was making him an offer .
What troubled me was that this top-down approach is still around .
Now , don &apos;t get me wrong , we need money .
I have come from so far to meet you like this .
Ciao bellos !
Kary Mullis : A next-gen cure for killer infections
And I was pulling a molecule out of this bag .
Actually our body doesn &apos;t hate these .
Our body loves these . It eats them .
And I said , why don &apos;t you use that ?
Our antibiotics are running out .
And I feel now like George Bush .
It &apos;s like &quot; mission accomplished . &quot;
And it &apos;s killing bacteria . It &apos;s eating them .
You can stick this to something called a DNA aptamer .
Why did they not die ?
So we did it . Okay ?
Mission accomplished !
Hans Rosling : Global population growth , box by box
This box contains one billion people .
And they lived away then .
And their aspiration was to buy a car .
This was the economic level at which Sweden was .
Just look how many .
The world population has doubled since I went to school .
And now their aspiration is not only to have a car .
So this is where they are today .
They are now buying cars .
So there they are .
This is the new world we have today in 2010 .
And what will happen in the future ?
Well , I &apos;m going to project into 2050 .
They will start flying .
And they will start to buy electric cars .
This is what we will find there .
So what about the poorest two billion ?
What about the poorest two billion here ?
Will they move on ?
Here &#91; among the poorest &#93; , population is growing .
Because we already have this &#91; growth &#93; in process .
Here I have on the screen my country bubbles .
Every bubble is a country . The size is population .
The colors show the continent .
That &apos;s India and this is China . Size is population .
The year is 1960 .
Look , Bangladesh catching up with India .
They are still up here .
And the population will double in one generation .
Child survival is the new green .
And will it happen ?
I &apos;m a very serious &quot; possibilist . &quot;
It can be done .
We can have a much more just world .
And look at the position of the old West .
This will not happen &#91; again &#93; .
But it &apos;s a very important role .
Do it well and get used to it .
Thank you very much .
Joe Sabia : The technology of storytelling
Ladies and gentlemen , gather around .
I would love to share with you a story .
It was venerable .
It was ubiquitous .
But it was a little bit boring .
His name was Lothar , Lothar Meggendorfer .
He grabbed his pen , he snatched his scissors .
For this delight and for this wonder , people rejoiced .
There seemed to be no cure for this Meggendorferitis .
One Taiwanese production studio would interpret American politics in 3D .
And this was a cause for celebration .
The art of storytelling has remained unchanged .
And for the most part , the stories are recycled .
Jeff Smith : Lessons in business ... from prison
For the most part , everyone was just trying to survive .
It &apos;s a lot harder than you might think .
And it &apos;s hard for a couple of reasons .
So how do you survive ?
Well , you learn to hustle , all kinds of hustles .
There &apos;s legal hustles .
You pay everything in stamps . Those are the currency .
You charge another inmate to clean his cell .
You want a cigarette in prison ? Three to five dollars .
You want a dirty magazine ?
Well , it can be as much as 1,000 dollars .
All they &apos;ll learn on the inside is new hustles .
Thank you .
Alex Laskey : How behavioral science can lower your energy bill
How many of you have checked your email today ?
Come on , raise your hands .
How many of you are checking it right now ?
And how about finances ? Anybody check that today ?
Credit card , investment account ?
How about this week ?
Now , how about your household energy use ?
Anybody check that today ?
This week ? Last week ?
A few energy geeks spread out across the room .
It &apos;s good to see you guys .
The woman in the photo with me is Harriet .
We met her on our first family vacation .
This is the story of how Harriet came to pay attention .
In fact , only 10 percent ends up as light .
Turn off your air conditioning , turn on your fans .
Another group got an environmental message .
Most people guessed that money-saving message would work best of all .
In fact , none of these messages worked .
They had zero impact on energy consumption .
And wouldn &apos;t you know it , they did .
So what does this tell us ?
In fact , it already is .
And it &apos;s working .
And we &apos;re not burning anything .
That &apos;s half our coal usage right there .
So what are we waiting for ?
Utilities are still rewarded when their customers waste energy .
They ought to be rewarded for helping their customers save it .
But this story is much more than about household energy use .
Take a look at the Prius .
Which brings us back to Harriet .
We met her on our first family vacation .
It was then that her eyes lit up .
Now I &apos;m here with a genuine expert .
Tell me . What should I do to save energy ? &quot;
There are many experts who can help answer Harriet &apos;s question .
My goal is to make sure we are all asking it .
Thank you .
Miwa Matreyek : Glorious visions in animation and performance
Miwa Matreyek !
Ami Klin : A new way to diagnose autism
We intuit other people &apos;s feelings .
We know the meaning of their actions even before they happen .
We are social to the core .
And for them , autism was devastating .
They had profound intellectual disabilities .
Extremely , extremely isolated .
These are survival skills .
They orient to the caregiver .
Well , they orient to the caregiver .
The caregiver seeks the baby .
It doesn &apos;t . It begins with the beginning of life .
You &apos;d do probably two things , wouldn &apos;t you ?
You would recoil . You would call the police .
We do so , remember , intuitively , effortlessly .
And this is not something that happens to humans only .
Now remember that we learn a great deal by sharing experiences .
There are those individuals who don &apos;t talk at all .
There are those individuals who talk too much .
There are millions of individuals with autism all around us .
The societal cost of this condition is huge .
It &apos;s not that that window closes . It doesn &apos;t .
But it diminishes considerably .
So I feel that we have a bio-ethical imperative .
So this is our view of autism .
Autism creates itself .
So how do we do that ?
We had to see the world through her eyes .
We can see moment by moment what children are engaging with .
You &apos;re watching a video .
What are the children with autism doing ?
They are focusing on the revolving door , opening and shutting .
It &apos;s something very different .
I thought at the time that this was an intractable condition .
No longer . We can do a great deal of things .
And the idea is not to cure autism .
That &apos;s not the idea .
And there are those individuals who have incredible artistic abilities .
We want them to be free of that .
Well thank you for listening to me .
Alan Siegel : Let &apos;s simplify legal jargon !
I &apos;ve been simplifying things for 30 years .
I come out of the advertising and design business .
This is a real thing .
And many people might need help in computation .
And what about terms like &quot; over the limit &quot; ?
Perhaps a stealth thing .
Define it in context . Tell people what it means .
Plain English is about changing the content .
It &apos;s a grid , it &apos;s a calendar .
Received very favorably by business .
And there is some good news to report today .
There are 200 million letters that go out .
All the parts of the document in red are not intelligible .
They have been tested in the laboratory .
And the IRS has introduced the program .
We see all this complexity .
So , how are we going to change the world ?
Make clarity , transparency and simplicity a national priority .
I thank you .
Rodney Brooks : Why we will rely on robots
That we &apos;re overestimating the technology in the short term .
So I &apos;m scared we won &apos;t have enough robots .
And they would look that up .
The librarians were afraid their jobs were going to disappear .
But that &apos;s not what happened in fact .
Same thing happened in offices .
Back in the old days , people used spreadsheets .
But here was an interesting thing that came along .
So office workers became programmers of spreadsheets .
It increased their capabilities .
On the left there is the PackBot from iRobot .
So the robot takes over the dangerous jobs .
These are in hundreds of hospitals across the U.S.
And they take the dirty sheets down to the laundry .
They take the dirty dishes back to the kitchen .
They bring the medicines up from the pharmacy .
And ordinary people can &apos;t interact with them .
It &apos;s displaced the worker from the technology .
So Baxter is up here .
This is Chris Harbert from Rethink Robotics .
We &apos;ve got a conveyor there .
And then it &apos;ll go back , reach for another object .
The interesting thing is Baxter has some basic common sense .
By the way , what &apos;s going on with the eyes ?
The eyes are on the screen there .
The eyes look ahead where the robot &apos;s going to move .
And Baxter &apos;s safe to interact with .
But with Baxter it doesn &apos;t hurt .
It puts a little icon there .
That puts the green icon there .
He didn &apos;t have to select that from a menu .
These robots we &apos;re shipping every day .
They go to factories around the country .
This is Mildred .
Mildred &apos;s a factory worker in Connecticut .
She &apos;s worked on the line for over 20 years .
She decided she really liked robots .
Now she &apos;s got the robot doing it .
They &apos;re older , and they &apos;re getting older and older .
There aren &apos;t many young people coming into factory work .
There &apos;s two great forces that are both volitional but inevitable .
That &apos;s climate change and demographics .
Demographics is really going to change our world .
This is the percentage of adults who are working age .
And it &apos;s gone down slightly over the last 40 years .
The percentage of adults who are working age drops dramatically .
That &apos;s happening statistically right now .
And I don &apos;t mean robots in terms of companions .
Thanks very much .
Marco Tempest : A magical tale
Today &apos;s its debut .
It &apos;s a demonstration of augmented reality .
And the visuals you &apos;re about to see are not prerecorded .
They are live and reacting to me in real time .
So fingers crossed .
And keep your eyes on the big screen .
Magic is deception , but it is a deception we enjoy .
Without it , a script is just words .
Augmented reality is just the latest technology .
And sleight of hand is just an artful demonstration of dexterity .
We are all very good at suspending our disbelief .
Without this ability there is no magic .
Jean Robert-Houdin : A conjurer is not a juggler .
He is an actor playing the part of a magician .
The tricks of magic follow the archetypes of narrative fiction .
Now many of them are intensely dramatic .
Because the best stories always have a happy ending .
The tricks of magic have one special element .
They are stories with a twist .
He said that magicians deliberately exploit the way their audiences think .
MT : In that respect , magic tricks are like jokes .
Jokes lead us down a path to an expected destination .
The same thing happens when people watch magic tricks .
It &apos;s fun to be fooled .
We feel compelled to tell them .
They want to share the experience .
It keeps me busy .
We think in narrative structures .
It &apos;s a uniquely human achievement .
We turn facts into similes and metaphors , and even fantasies .
They give us our identity and a sense of community .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Hi .
I did that for two reasons .
I &apos;m used to a stationary mic .
It &apos;s the sensible shoe of public address .
I just become skanky .
So I &apos;m sorry about that .
And I &apos;m already off-message .
You cannot turn them off with a switch .
Soon , it had occurred to me what my job was .
Because that is what Knopf is .
We bring stories to the public .
They all need a face .
But you don &apos;t do this . &quot;
Because this is treating your audience like a moron .
And they deserve better .
So there you are .
Pure content and pure form , side by side .
No fighting , ladies .
Now , what is the story here ?
Someone is re-engineering dinosaurs by extracting their DNA from prehistoric amber .
Genius !
We &apos;re in the middle of the process .
And then I just threw some typography on it .
Very basic stuff , slightly suggestive of public park signage .
And even back then , Michael was on the cutting edge .
I miss Michael .
Well , they used it .
And I was thrilled .
No , that is not me .
I was so wasted . &quot;
That &apos;s a responsibility .
And it &apos;s a responsibility that I don &apos;t take lightly .
You get something that goes much deeper than that .
Hello !
What does that mean ?
Very simple stuff .
This is going to be the opposite of that .
The answer was the most low-tech thing you can imagine .
Now , that &apos;s a good printing job .
A book cover is a distillation .
This story was a real puzzle .
This is what it &apos;s about .
And so , here &apos;s the design , right ?
Huhh ! They &apos;ve been discovered by the sultan .
He will not be pleased .
Huhh ! And now the sultan is in danger .
Try experiencing that on a Kindle .
Don &apos;t get me started .
Seriously .
He &apos;d smell it .
So how do we show this ?
So this is on a semi-transparent piece of velum .
It &apos;s one part of the form and content .
And the object itself invited exploration interaction , consideration and touch .
Not exactly Jackie Collins .
So that &apos;s my story . To be continued .
What does it look like ?
Thank you .
And it is .
And yet , it feels natural to us now .
At the time , we knew that it was political .
But her suffering is equal to mine .
Aicha el-Wafi : Good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen .
I am the mother of Zacarias Moussaoui .
So they introduced me to five families .
And I saw Phyllis , and I watched her .
She was the only mother in the group .
The others were brothers , sisters .
I suffered a lot as a mother .
I was married when I was 14 .
So the story with Zacarias was too much really .
I know she really cried for her son .
But she knows where he is .
My son , I don &apos;t know where he is .
I don &apos;t know what happened to him .
We must be hand-in-hand and do something together .
I talk against violence , against terrorism .
This is why I &apos;m here in front of you .
But we were all so nervous .
&quot; Why does she want to meet us ? &quot;
And then she was nervous .
&quot; Why did we want to meet her ? &quot;
What did we want from each other ?
Because our time is up .
You must be tolerant .
You have to fight against violence .
This is what I wanted to say .
Graham Hill : Why I &apos;m a weekday vegetarian
I also knew that I &apos;m not alone .
So why was I stalling ?
Imagine your last hamburger .
Sound familiar ?
So I wondered , might there be a third solution ?
It &apos;s called weekday veg .
On the weekend , your choice .
Simple .
The program has been great , weekday veg .
Thank you .
Taryn Simon : Photographs of secret sites
Photography threatens fantasy .
And the outsider can never really reach the core .
In this context I &apos;ll just show you a few .
So I create these two poles .
Every image is accompanied with a very detailed factual text .
This is a 21-year-old Palestinian woman undergoing hymenoplasty .
This process costs 60,000 dollars .
There is a pig &apos;s head and African cane rats .
I do take certain liberties and intervene .
It &apos;s a research crop marijuana grow room .
This is a Braille edition of Playboy magazine .
And Playboy is always in the top few .
And the film was shot on 72 millimeter , government-issue film .
And that red dot is a marking on the government-issue film .
Meaning white fur , ice blue eyes , a pink nose .
It &apos;s a very violent process that is little known .
Kenny was born . He actually made it to adulthood .
This is the Death Star .
And it &apos;s shown here in its true orientation .
They flip the negative .
This is at Fort Campbell in Kentucky .
It &apos;s a Military Operations on Urbanized Terrain site .
It &apos;s called the World Church of God .
It &apos;s supposed to be a generic site of worship .
And I put them into my photograph .
It runs 24 hours a day , commercial free .
It &apos;s titled &quot; The Innocents . &quot;
I &apos;ll give you an example from a case .
And he served 10 years of a life sentence .
He served 18 years of a death sentence .
Calvin Washington was convicted of capital murder .
He is photographed at his alibi location .
I photographed him at the scene of arrest in Chicago .
William Gregory was convicted of rape and burglary .
He served seven years of a 70 year sentence in Kentucky .
He had been misidentified by an 11-year-old victim .
Now I &apos;m going to leave you with a self portrait .
That &apos;s it . Thank you .
Ed Boyden : A light switch for neurons
Think about your day for a second .
Let &apos;s make it concrete .
It &apos;s called the basket cell .
New ones are being discovered everyday .
They &apos;re excitatory .
Every one of these cells is an incredible electrical device .
Could we dial-in information precisely where we want it to go ?
Now how are we going to do that ?
So how do we do this ?
So these molecules are called channelrhodopsins .
So this turned out to be very simple to do .
You take this DNA and you put it into a neuron .
So this is very powerful .
This field has now come to be known as optogenetics .
The brain will do more of whatever got that reward .
And so that &apos;s what happens .
And he &apos;ll do that hundreds and hundreds of times .
Now we can generalize the idea .
Or that could be good clinical targets for treating brain disorders .
This goes back to the Pavlovian days .
This tone used to mean bad news .
And now this next clip is just eight minutes later .
Okay , there it goes . Right now .
If we could do that , this could be extremely powerful .
I already told you that electrical stimulators are not uncommon .
Seventy-five thousand people have Parkinson &apos;s deep-brain stimulators implanted .
And the retina , of course , is a complex structure .
Now how could you repair this ?
The eye is still transparent and you can get light in .
So this is some work that we &apos;re doing .
So he &apos;s not using vision to do it .
So how are we going to solve this ?
Light is converted to electricity on them .
Thank you .
Ed Boyden : That &apos;s right .
Right , yeah .
Ueli Gegenschatz : Extreme wingsuit flying
I started with paragliding .
Also different aerobatic maneuvers are possible with a paraglider .
From there I started with skydiving .
From regular , relative skydiving I went on to freeflying .
Freeflying is more the three-dimensional skydiving .
The one with the yellow-green suit , he &apos;s flying head-down .
From freeflying I went on to skysurfing .
Skysurfing is skydiving with a board on the feet .
From there I went on to wingsuit flying .
This is a jump I did in Rio de Janeiro .
You can see the Copacabana on the left-hand side .
of being in free fall , with all the visual references .
In 2008 I jumped the Eiffel Tower in Paris .
Or this jump , from a moving truck on the highway .
You need to have the best possible equipment .
Enjoy , and thank you very much .
I have some questions .
I think we all might have some questions .
Because it looks like it might .
It &apos;s not possible to land a wingsuit yet .
And I believe soon .
UE : Nope . It &apos;s just smoke .
Coming off of you ?
UE : Hopefully not .
That seems dangerous .
What do you do to to cover your face ?
Are you in a helmet ? Are you in goggles ?
And is that how you usually fly ?
So you have to be prepared .
Right . Now is there anything you don &apos;t do ?
UE : Thank you very much .
Amanda Palmer : The art of asking
So I didn &apos;t always make my living from music .
Hello .
And I would get harassed sometimes .
People would yell at me from their passing cars .
&quot; Get a job ! &quot;
It was consistent .
This was me on piano , a genius drummer .
This is a library in Auckland .
And I lay there thinking , these people have so little .
Is this fair ?
And I thought , this is fair .
This is this .
I &apos;ve always been with my band or my crew .
Is this what stupid people do ?
Is this how stupid people die ?
So I couchsurf a lot . I also crowdsurf a lot .
I maintain couchsurfing and crowdsurfing are basically the same thing .
And meanwhile , my band is becoming bigger and bigger .
We signed with a major label .
And our music is a cross between punk and cabaret .
It &apos;s not for everybody .
Well , maybe it &apos;s for you .
And they walk off .
I just want you to have this money . &quot;
And this starts happening all the time .
Thank you .
And the goal was 100,000 dollars .
And you can see how many people it is .
It &apos;s about 25,000 people .
How did you make all these people pay for music ? &quot;
It &apos;s kind of counterintuitive for a lot of artists .
They don &apos;t want to ask for things .
And a lot of artists have a problem with this .
Asking makes you vulnerable .
And this hurt in a really familiar way .
So this is slightly not safe for work .
This is my Kickstarter backer party in Berlin .
Should I ? Show me .
I see them as trust .
Thank you .
They &apos;ve changed the world .
And this here is the infamous NSA data center in Utah .
And it &apos;s a pretty big building .
Maybe it &apos;s better to imagine it as a comparison .
This is five times larger .
How many hard drives can you fit in an IKEA store ?
Right ? It &apos;s pretty big .
In fact , 96 percent of the planet are foreigners .
Right ?
They &apos;re about doing surveillance on people they know are innocent .
Now we know for a fact it &apos;s happening .
We didn &apos;t know about DoubleArrow .
But now we do .
So that &apos;s basically perfectly safe , uncrackable .
Backdooring encryption algorithms just boggles the mind .
But of course , these intelligence agencies are doing their job .
So what do we actually know about the leaks ?
Everything is based on the files leaked by Mr. Snowden .
And every single one of these companies denies .
Yet we have these files .
Instead , they &apos;ve been hacked .
And there &apos;s more evidence supporting this theory as well .
What the hell ?
All countries spy .
And maybe that &apos;s true .
Let &apos;s take , for example , Sweden .
And then we turn it around .
How many American leaders use Swedish webmails and cloud services ?
And the answer is zero .
So this is not balanced .
It &apos;s not balanced by any means , not even close .
Like , Skype used to be secure .
It used to be end-to-end encrypted .
Then it was sold to the United States .
Today , it no longer is secure .
It &apos;s the war on terror .
You shouldn &apos;t worry about it .
Well , it &apos;s not the war on terror .
It &apos;s not the war on terror .
Feel free to survey me if that helps .
And I have nothing to hide .
I &apos;m not doing anything bad or anything illegal .
Privacy is nonnegotiable .
It should be built in to all the systems we use .
And surveillance changes history .
We know this through examples of corrupt presidents like Nixon .
She was one of the targets of NSA surveillance .
That &apos;s what it &apos;s about .
Privacy is the building block of our democracies .
So Mr. Snowden , he &apos;s been blamed for many things .
So , what is there to be done ?
Should we worry . No , we shouldn &apos;t worry .
But that &apos;s not going to really change the situation .
And that &apos;s much easier said than done .
How do you do that ?
But maybe you don &apos;t have to do it alone .
Maybe you can do it together with other countries .
The solution is open source .
It only has to solve one little problem .
Thank you very much .
Charlie Todd : The shared experience of absurdity
Now this took place in January of 2002 .
And this woman is the star of the video .
She doesn &apos;t know she &apos;s being filmed .
She &apos;s being filmed with a hidden camera .
This is on the 6 train in New York City .
And this is the first stop along the line .
And that &apos;s me right there in a brown coat .
It &apos;s about 30 degrees outside .
I &apos;m wearing a hat . I &apos;m wearing a scarf .
And the girl &apos;s going to notice me right here .
One person &apos;s not that unusual .
They &apos;re going to be entering this car one by one .
We &apos;ll act as though we don &apos;t know each other .
And watch her make eye contact with them right about now .
So the video won &apos;t show everything .
This goes on for another four stops .
A total of seven guys enter anonymously in their underwear .
Thank you .
So that &apos;s a still from the video there .
And I love that girl &apos;s reaction so much .
And we &apos;ve continued to do it every year .
So I could do more large-scale projects .
So I got inspired by that .
This was completely unauthorized .
We didn &apos;t let the stores know we were coming .
And I stood in the park giving signals .
The second signal was for everybody to do Jumping jacks together .
You &apos;ll see that start right here .
And then we had dancing . We had everyone dance .
There were several other activities .
There &apos;s a better photo of it .
So here &apos;s the video .
So again , this is 2005 .
This is the Best Buy in New York City .
There was an eight year-old girl , a 10 year-old girl .
There was also a 65 year-old man who participated .
So a very diverse group of people .
But also , don &apos;t shop .
Just stand around and don &apos;t face products . &quot;
Everybody else is one of our actors .
The lower level employees thought it was very funny .
You can see them in this footage .
They &apos;re wearing either a yellow shirt or a black shirt .
And you can see the cops in this footage right here .
Thank you .
And one morning , I was riding the subway .
It &apos;s morning rush hour .
It &apos;s very cold outside .
Thank you .
And of course they don &apos;t .
You know , as kids , we &apos;re taught to play .
And we &apos;re never given a reason why we should play .
It &apos;s just acceptable that play is a good thing .
We don &apos;t need a reason .
Thank you very much .
Edi Rama : Take back your city with paint
In my previous life , I was an artist .
I still paint . I love art .
We faced many challenges .
But this use of colors was not just an artistic act .
He screeched that he would block the financing .
&quot; But why ? &quot; I asked him .
So it &apos;s time for change .
What are colors doing to us ? &quot;
Thirty-seven said no , we don &apos;t like it .
So we noticed change .
They had thrown the old shutter in the garbage collection place .
&quot; Come on , man ! What policemen ?
And this was not a misplaced feeling .
Crime did fall .
We removed 123,000 tons of concrete only from the riverbanks .
We planted 55,000 trees and bushes in the streets .
It &apos;s not about genes .
It &apos;s about system , it &apos;s about organization .
It &apos;s also about environment and respect .
We removed the kiosks .
We put the citizen first , and not the clerks .
I tweet . I love it .
Politics is not just about leaders .
It &apos;s not just about politicians and laws .
Our world is defined by the pace of change .
We can all change the world .
Efharisto and kalinihta .
Dan Meyer : Math class needs a makeover
I teach high school math .
I mean , it &apos;s just a losing proposition .
One is computation ; this is the stuff you &apos;ve forgotten .
For example , factoring quadratics with leading coefficients greater than one .
all but ensures they won &apos;t retain it .
Students lack perseverance .
This is really destructive .
He called it , &quot; an impatience with irresolution . &quot;
You &apos;re impatient with things that don &apos;t resolve quickly .
It applies equally to math .
I believe in real life .
Here &apos;s a really cool problem . I like this .
It &apos;s about defining steepness and slope using a ski lift .
I &apos;ll define them here : You have the visual .
So I hope you can see .
That &apos;s all we &apos;re doing here .
It &apos;s been obvious in my practice , to me .
And here &apos;s how it works .
I like this question . It &apos;s about a water tank .
First things first , we eliminate all the substeps .
Students have to develop those , they have to formulate those .
None of it &apos;s a distractor , so we lose that .
Such an underrepresented question in math curriculum .
So now we have a water tank .
So now we have the real deal .
How long will it take it to fill it up ?
And it &apos;s filling up slowly , agonizingly slowly .
It &apos;s tedious .
And then we follow the process I &apos;ve described .
We , instead , just watch the end of the movie .
This has been a lot of fun .
Math makes sense of the world .
Math is the vocabulary for your own intuition .
We need more patient problem solvers . Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Mariana Mazzucato : Government -- investor , risk-taker , innovator
Usually when I say this , someone says , &quot; Spotify !
That &apos;s Europe . &quot; But , yeah .
They are more dynamic .
This monster with big tentacles .
They &apos;re very explicit in these editorials .
Fund the infrastructure . Fund the schools .
Leave the rest to the revolutionaries . &quot;
Those colorful , out-of-the-box kind of thinkers .
GPS was funded by the military &apos;s Navstar program .
Even Siri was actually funded by DARPA .
They do . They spend on the marketing part .
They spend on the D part of R &amp; amp ; D.
It was actually shaping and creating markets .
It was even , God forbid , being a venture capitalist .
They want their returns in three to five years .
Who &apos;s actually funding the hard stuff ?
Of course , it &apos;s not just the state .
The private sector does a lot .
And so there &apos;s huge implications of this .
It &apos;s actually been the one thinking out of the box .
That whole juxtaposition thing , it &apos;s kind of there .
Well , there &apos;s a self-fulfilling prophecy .
You will fail when you innovative .
One out of 10 experiments has any success .
The Internet was crazy .
Well , unfortunately , that &apos;s not true .
Let the jobs go where they have to go , perhaps .
I mean , one can take a position on that .
It could happen perhaps through equity .
Thank you .
Jennifer 8 . Lee : The hunt for General Tso
What is this ?
Should I try it ?
Try it !
What is it called ?
Fortune cookie .
There &apos;s a piece of paper inside !
What is this ?
You &apos;ve won a prize !
What is this ?
It &apos;s a fortune !
Tasty !
So , where are they from ?
The short answer is , actually , they &apos;re from Japan .
So , how did they get to the United States ?
They are more American than anything else .
I love this dish .
He &apos;s in Taiwan right now .
He &apos;s retired , deaf and plays a lot of Mahjong .
I went to his home town .
And I went looking for chicken .
Finally found a cow -- and did find chicken .
And then they &apos;re like , is this Chinese food ?
Because it doesn &apos;t look like Chinese food to them .
Now , who came up with the idea of chop suey ?
So it was an early exercise of intellectual property rights .
So , you see different varieties of Chinese food .
She &apos;s like , &quot; It &apos;s not ?
And even the Brits have their own version .
This is a dish called Magic Bowl that I discovered .
But you know what ?
Instead , they had 110 , and they were completely shocked .
It wasn &apos;t that .
Yeah . So , I went and started looking .
So , a good sort of contrast is Chicken McNuggets .
And this logo !
So . Thank you very much .
Dong Woo Jang : The art of bow-making
Why bows ?
I &apos;m not quite sure .
And I did not bring the tools here to Long Beach .
Airport security .
I also researched extensively on bows around the world .
The most effective bow for me would be like this .
And four : Horn used to store energy in compression .
Thanks to my ancestors for robbing me of my invention .
And let &apos;s see how this one works .
This is a bamboo bow , with 45-pound draw weights .
You need to console and communicate with the wood material .
The bow resembles me , and I resemble the bow .
Now , I am shooting a part of myself to you .
Did it strike you ?
Thank you .
Erin McKean : The joy of lexicography
How about this word ?
Here , I &apos;ll show it to you .
Lexicography : the practice of compiling dictionaries .
It &apos;s little discrete -- that &apos;s spelled D-I-S-C-R-E-T-E -- bits .
And those bits are words .
Right ? Nobody hugs their dictionaries .
For one thing , I just do not do uniforms .
Well , I blame the Queen .
Why do I blame the Queen ?
So , there &apos;s this guy , right ? Victorian era .
James Murray , first editor of the Oxford English Dictionary .
There &apos;d be virtually no learning curve .
Computers ! What about computers ?
The thing about computers is , I love computers .
They don &apos;t change the end result .
It &apos;s steampunk . What we have is an electric velocipede .
The design has not changed .
And OK , what about online dictionaries , right ?
Online dictionaries must be different .
This is my favorite word , by the way .
Very useful word . So , look at that .
Online dictionaries right now are paper thrown up on a screen .
So there &apos;s not very much going on here .
There &apos;s not a lot of clickiness .
Does everyone know the ham butt problem ?
Woman &apos;s making a ham for a big , family dinner .
We have a pan that &apos;s too small !
So , you can &apos;t get a smaller ham .
The English language is as big as it is .
Some of my best friends are books .
But the book is not the best shape for the dictionary .
Now they &apos;re going to think &quot; Oh , boy .
No . There will still be paper dictionaries .
And I think this is a problem .
Lexicography is really more about material science .
They &apos;re just the right tools for the job .
Being in the dictionary is an artificial distinction .
If you love a word , it becomes real .
You can ask for help !
That &apos;s 500,000 more words . So that &apos;s a lot .
There &apos;s a lot going on there .
The OED has 33 different numbered definitions for set .
Tiny , little word , 33 numbered definitions .
One of them is just labeled &quot; miscellaneous technical senses . &quot;
Do you know what that says to me ?
I mean , lexicography is not rocket science .
And we don &apos;t even know the shape of the language .
We &apos;re missing California from American English .
So again , lexicography is not rocket science .
It can &apos;t be that hard to find some words !
He &apos;s a director of an electroplating company .
He &apos;s found more than 140 comets .
But he found 140 comets without a telescope .
Now , y &apos;all know where I &apos;m going with this .
Where did it come from ? Who said it ?
What newspaper was it in ? What book ?
Because a word is like an archaeological artifact .
So a word without its source is like a cut flower .
It dies too fast .
They use it synecdochically .
We can put in all the meanings .
Doesn &apos;t everyone want more meaning in their lives ?
This is what dictionaries used to look like .
It wasn &apos;t really what people needed .
Thank you very much for your kind attention .
Angela Belcher : Using nature to grow batteries
I brought along with me an abalone shell .
Yet , it &apos;s 3,000 times tougher than its geological counterpart .
So that &apos;s the vision that I &apos;ve been thinking about .
I like to say my favorite biomaterial is my four year-old .
Before that , they were all soft , fluffy structures .
So nature already gives us really exquisite structures on the nanoscale .
So here are some examples : these are some natural shells .
There are natural biological materials .
These proteins are very negatively charged .
And so here &apos;s the periodic table .
And I absolutely love the periodic table .
And so I give this out to thousands of people .
And that &apos;s a hard sell to a graduate student .
&quot; I have this great project -- 50 million years . &quot;
And this is pretty easy biotechnology .
And you could basically do this a billion times .
We engineered a virus to pick up carbon nanotubes .
So one part of the virus grabs a carbon nanotube .
And then it wires itself to the current collector .
I brought it here .
You can make lots of amplifications to it .
We &apos;re able to do this also with catalysis .
This is the example of photocatalytic splitting of water .
And I brought an example with me of that today .
My students promised me it would work .
These are virus-assembled nanowires .
In this case , you &apos;re seeing oxygen bubbles come out .
The last example are solar cells .
You can also do this with solar cells .
So this is a virus-based solar cell .
Thank you .
Stefan Sagmeister : Happiness by design
And at the time I was very superstitious .
But I actually walked away with a great job offer .
So there are , of course , two different possibilities .
This is 1983 .
And I remember it as a true moment of happiness .
While , somewhat , the Spaniards ...
And their inaugural exhibit was called &quot; Happiness . &quot;
And they interestingly sectioned the exhibit off into four different areas .
Under &quot; Nirvana &quot; they showed this Constable painting .
And there was a little -- an interesting theory about abstraction .
This is , you know , a book .
It &apos;s a happy David Byrne and an angry David Byrne .
You know , that &apos;s not a big deal to accomplish .
This is , you know , the movie poster .
True printed his own version of these signs .
So this is one .
Now , True is a real humanitarian .
Another New York project .
Opens up at dusk and dawn every day .
You don &apos;t see the horizon .
And the room is truly something to be seen .
People &apos;s demeanor changes when they go in there .
He &apos;s from Korea originally .
And other people go and fill them in .
You know , one is : just working without pressure .
Then : working concentrated , without being frazzled .
And being able to enjoy the end results .
And the whole thing just fell together .
Again , we could supply the content for it .
So I just picked another one .
And this was two weeks ago .
And then we did one more of these .
This is , again , for a magazine , dividing pages .
This is from the front .
Then it &apos;s : &quot; always works out . &quot;
Then it &apos;s &quot; for , &quot; with the light on .
And it &apos;s &quot; me . &quot;
Thank you so much .
Stephen Hawking &apos;s zero g flight
And I want to tell you that story .
I first met him through the Archon X PRIZE for Genomics .
Craig Venter chairs that event .
Come back down , you weigh twice as much .
You do it again and again .
We set out to do this .
It took us 11 years to become operational .
And we announced that we were going to fly Stephen Hawking .
And he wanted to go .
We worked hard to get all the permissions .
And what he said , for me , was very moving .
I therefore want to encourage public interest in space . &quot;
A few TEDsters here .
We set up a whole ER .
So we did a second parabola .
And a third .
And a seventh and an eighth .
And this man does not look like a 65-year-old wheelchair-bound man .
He was so happy .
Please join us in this epic adventure .
Thank you so much .
Matt Killingsworth : Want to be happier ? Stay in the moment
It &apos;s that we expect them to bring us happiness .
Maybe he &apos;s worried that he &apos;s going bald .
Any of those yes responses are what we called mind-wandering .
So what did we find ?
It &apos;s amazing .
Well , how often do people &apos;s minds wander ?
How does that depend on what people are doing ?
It pervades basically everything that we do .
Thank you .
Eli Beer : The fastest ambulance ? A motorcycle
This is an ambucycle .
This is the fastest way to reach any medical emergency .
It has everything an ambulance has except for a bed .
You see the defibrillator . You see the equipment .
We all saw the tragedy that happened in Boston .
I grew up in a small neighborhood in Jerusalem .
We were passing by a bus stop .
We saw a bus blow up in front of our eyes .
He just needed someone helping him .
We were so scared and we just ran away .
For two years , I volunteered on an ambulance in Jerusalem .
The traffic is so bad . The distance , and everything .
We never got there when somebody really needed us .
That second he declared this child dead .
He could have run from a block away .
He could have saved this child .
I said to myself , there must be a better way .
Just alert us by beeper .
We &apos;re not really interested in these kinds of new adventures .
&quot; I don &apos;t need your help , &quot; he said .
I was a very stubborn kid .
I ran there by foot . I had no medical equipment .
He was on Coumadin .
He was bleeding from his neck .
So today , 22 years later , we have United Hatzalah .
I forgot I &apos;m not in Israel .
We &apos;re not there to replace ambulances .
And we save people that otherwise would not be saved .
The second reason is because of our technology .
You know , Israelis are good in technology .
And the third thing are these ambucycles .
These ambucycles are an ambulance on two wheels .
They never , literally , get stuck in traffic .
That &apos;s why we get there so fast .
Muhammad Asli and Murad Alyan .
We started hand in hand saving Jews and Arabs .
Arabs were saving Jews . Jews were saving Arabs .
Something special happened .
Settlers were saving Arabs and Arabs were saving settlers .
And these are all volunteers .
No one is getting money .
They &apos;re all doing it for the purpose of saving lives .
And he saved my father .
Could you imagine how I felt in that moment ?
When I started this organization , I was 17 years old .
I never even knew what TEDMED was then .
But it could spread everywhere .
It &apos;s very easy to adopt .
Last year alone , we treated in Israel 207,000 people .
Forty-two thousand of them were life-threatening situations .
And we made a difference .
We all want to be heroes .
Thank you very much .
Joshua Silver : Adjustable liquid-filled eyeglasses
I &apos;d like to start with a little experiment .
They also have an estimate of around a billion .
Glasses are not very expensive . They &apos;re quite plentiful .
There are just way too few eye care professionals .
This is the ratio of optometrists to people in sub-Saharan Africa .
Next step in my process .
So , I &apos;ve now made eye glasses to my prescription .
Okay , so I &apos;ve made these glasses and ...
Okay , I &apos;ve made the glasses to my prescription and ...
... I &apos;ve just ...
And I &apos;ve now made some glasses . That &apos;s it .
Now , these aren &apos;t the only pair in the world .
In fact , this technology &apos;s been evolving .
There are about 30,000 in use now .
I have a global vision for vision .
But the cost has to be brought right down .
How do you solve this problem ?
You start to get into detail .
How do you deal with the industry ?
And the answer to that is research .
Julia Bacha : Pay attention to nonviolence
I &apos;m a filmmaker .
Why aren &apos;t Palestinians using nonviolent resistance ?
Yet , most of you have probably never heard about them .
Palestinian We were told the wall would separate Palestine from Israel .
Today you &apos;re invited to a peaceful march .
You are joined by dozens of your Israeli brothers and sisters .
Israeli Activist : Nothing scares the army more than nonviolent opposition .
But I think the girls could do it .
Chanting : One united nation .
Fatah , Hamas and the Popular Front !
News Anchor : The clashes over the fence continue .
Reporter : Israeli border police were sent to disperse the crowd .
They were allowed to use any force necessary .
These are live bullets .
It &apos;s like Fallujah . Shooting everywhere .
But there were others around me who weren &apos;t even cowering .
Protester : This is a peaceful march .
There is no need to use violence .
Chanting : We can do it ! We can do it !
We can do it !
Yet the media remains mostly silent on these stories .
But that &apos;s true for adults too .
So we organized a screening .
So they kept on going .
These leaders have proven that nonviolence works in places like Budrus .
Thank you .
Seth Godin : How to get your ideas to spread
Like the greatest invention since ... the telegraph or something .
I call it the &quot; TV-industrial complex . &quot;
You use the distribution you get to sell more products .
You take the profit from that to buy more ads .
Right . Articles about water , ads about water .
Now there are magazines about water .
New products from Coke Japan -- water salad .
Cows are invisible . Cows are boring .
I could do that again if you want it .
And that is the essence of where idea diffusion is going .
Every week the number one best-selling DVD in America changes .
Because it &apos;s new , because it &apos;s fresh .
And when Lionel started his bakery the French pooh-pooh-ed it .
It wasn &apos;t what they expected .
That &apos;s what mass marketing is .
It was all about going for the center .
But market to these people because they care .
These are the people who are obsessed with something .
It &apos;ll spread to the entire curve .
Krispy Kreme has figured this whole thing out .
Not everybody wants it but they don &apos;t care .
These guys make the loudest car stereo in the world .
Pearl Jam , 96 albums released in the last two years .
Every one made a profit . How ?
They only sell them on their website .
This hospital crib cost 10,000 dollars , 10 times the standard .
But hospitals are buying it faster than any other model .
And one person at a time , the idea spreads .
These are not diamonds , not really .
They &apos;re made from &quot; cremains . &quot;
Oh , you like my ring ? It &apos;s my grandmother .
Fastest-growing business in the whole mortuary industry .
A couple of quick rules to wrap up .
Proctor and Gamble knows this , right ?
Very good is boring . Very good is average .
So my three stories .
Sales tripled . Why ?
Because he did something that was at the fringes .
People with 20,000-dollar stereos don &apos;t like new music .
The last example I want to give you .
This is a map of Soap Lake , Washington .
But they do have a lake .
That &apos;s a purple cow ; that &apos;s something worth noticing .
Thank you very much for your attention .
Rob Hopkins : Transition to a world without oil
Other stories are that everything is on the verge of unraveling .
But I want to tell you a different story here today .
Like all stories , it has a beginning .
If you could help me with that it would be fantastic .
This is a liter of oil .
It gives us an energy return that &apos;s unimaginable , historically .
And that gap continues to widen .
Completely unprecedented , historically .
Already that &apos;s fallen to about 11 .
There are 98 oil-producing nations in the world .
But of those , 65 have already passed their peak .
We have no choice other than deep and urgent decarbonization .
Otherwise you &apos;d flood your entire town with warm porridge .
It &apos;s something that was unimaginable to people then .
And we have the elves in the form of China .
This is a popular story in some places .
But the world isn &apos;t Second Life .
We can be astonishingly inventive and creative .
Energy and technology are not the same thing .
What I &apos;m involved with is the transition response .
It &apos;s something which has spread incredibly fast .
And it is something which has several characteristics .
It &apos;s sensitive to place and to scale .
Transitional is completely different .
It learns very much from its mistakes .
And it &apos;s a process which is really joyful .
The idea of resilience comes from the study of ecology .
So how does this transition idea work ?
They pick up some of the tools that we &apos;ve developed .
They show films , they give talks , and so on .
It &apos;s a process which is playful and creative and informative .
There are now over 200 formal transition projects .
They are mulling whether they &apos;re going to take it further .
We need international legislation from Copenhagen and so on .
We need national responses . We need local government responses .
A lot of places are working with their local schools .
Planting productive trees throughout urban spaces .
You take it anywhere else , it &apos;s not worth anything .
And that &apos;s certainly been my experience with transition .
And we see it all over the place as well now .
Because I think stories are vital here .
I &apos;ve been astonishingly lucky , we &apos;ve been astonishingly lucky .
Thank you very much .
&quot; People do stupid things .
That &apos;s what spreads HIV . &quot;
Well , one or two brave souls .
Wonderful .
It &apos;s getting blunter and blunter .
&quot; Oh yeah , by sharing needles . &quot;
&quot; Oh yeah . &quot; Hundred percent .
&quot; So are you carrying a needle ? &quot;
&quot; Are you carrying clean needles ? &quot;
One in four , maximum .
There &apos;s just kind of an ick factor there .
And that changes the equation slightly , doesn &apos;t it ?
So , suddenly it becomes perfectly rational to share needles .
This is a really easy problem .
For once , your incentives are aligned .
We &apos;ve got what &apos;s rational for public health .
So she was making a politically rational decision .
There is nothing on the other side .
So , completely irrational , you would think .
So it becomes quite rational to deny services to injectors .
Now let &apos;s talk about sex .
Are we any more rational about sex ?
It &apos;s not that easy !
Here , maybe you &apos;ll have better luck .
And that is reflected in the epidemic that we have today .
You can see these horrifying figures from Africa .
No one wants it .
This , for example , this gentleman is called Joseph .
He &apos;s from Haiti and he has AIDS .
Not for nothing do we call it the Lazarus Effect .
Let &apos;s just stop treating people . &quot;
Of course not , of course not .
We need to expand antiretroviral treatment as much as we can .
So these are data from Scotland .
Then it came way down .
This is of new infections .
What does that mean ?
What does it mean ?
Is that what &apos;s happening ?
No , and I call it the &quot; compassion conundrum . &quot;
Why does she do that job ?
It varies a bit province to province .
Okay , Ines .
Ines : So why is prevalence still rising ?
It &apos;s all politics .
When you get to politics , nothing makes sense .
The truth is that everyone has a different rationale .
But here &apos;s the thing : we are the voters .
Thank you .
Ellen Dunham-Jones : Retrofitting suburbia
So why is this important ?
Public health is another reason to consider retrofitting .
And then there &apos;s finally -- there &apos;s the affordability question .
I mean , that &apos;s 2005 figures .
But is it practical ?
I think it is .
They &apos;re the other big generation .
It no longer just makes sense .
That land is more valuable than just surface parking lots .
It turns out , all sorts of things .
It &apos;s keeping the lights on .
It &apos;s becoming , I think , a really great institution .
But some of them have been much more incremental .
So , you know , sometimes it &apos;s incremental .
Sometimes , it &apos;s all at once .
Transit is a big driver of retrofits .
So here &apos;s what it looks like .
This one is one of my favorites , Belmar .
This was a very large mall on a hundred-acre superblock .
Here was the mall in its heyday .
So here &apos;s the site in 1975 with the mall .
By 1995 , the mall has died .
The department stores are multistory ; they &apos;re better built .
They &apos;re easy to be re-adapted .
But the one story stuff ...
that &apos;s really history .
So here it is at projected build-out .
It &apos;s about two-thirds built out right now .
Here &apos;s what the new Main Street looks like .
You want to also try to get more systemic transformation .
We need to also retrofit the corridors themselves .
So this is one that has been retrofitted in California .
But densification is not going to work everywhere .
Sometimes re-greening is really the better answer .
This is another re-greening example .
It also makes sense in very strong markets .
The creek had been culverted under the parking lot .
What &apos;s next ?
I think we have three challenges for the future .
Where should we be redeveloping ?
And where should we be encouraging re-inhabitation ?
I have to say , these are very hybrid places .
They are new but trying to look old .
They have urban streetscapes , but suburban parking ratios .
But we &apos;ve got to get the architecture better .
The final challenge is for all of you .
Thank you .
Mitchell Besser : Mothers helping mothers fight HIV
I want you to take a trip with me .
and people are initially reluctant to tell you .
HIV isn &apos;t like other medical conditions ; it &apos;s stigmatizing .
This map depicts the global distribution of HIV .
We talk about things in relative terms .
The reality is really , very different .
It &apos;s an entire package of services , and it works .
What does that mean ?
And where do they come from ?
Well , less than one comes from the United States .
One , on average , comes from Europe .
100 come from Asia and the Pacific .
And let &apos;s look at another map .
That thin sliver you see here , that &apos;s Africa .
And it &apos;s the same with nurses .
It &apos;s not possible -- it doesn &apos;t work .
And so we need to find better ways of providing care .
Meds don &apos;t equal medical care .
And I want to change the story a little bit .
They &apos;re drinking tea , they &apos;re having sandwiches .
Have a seat . You &apos;re safe here .
We &apos;re all HIV-positive .
Your baby is going to be HIV-negative . &quot;
We view mothers as a community &apos;s single greatest resource .
So often the men are gone .
This is the medical care that goes beyond just medicines .
Now , doctors and nurses -- they too get trained .
Our mentor mothers get trained every single year and retrained .
Our organization has three goals .
The first , to prevent mother-to-child transmission .
So how do we do it ?
Men are not frequently part of pregnancy care .
And this is so important in breaking through the stigma .
Disclosure is so central to prevention .
We also work in groups .
The hardest barrier really is around stigma reduction .
And it &apos;s important about disclosure .
And so the mentor mother went along with .
And everybody was quiet .
I &apos;m HIV-positive .
I &apos;ve been afraid to tell everybody . &quot;
And you see where this is going .
I thought you were going to hate me . &quot;
I am proof that there is hope .
And it is a crisis in health care systems .
So we talk in terms of what we call task-shifting .
How do you build a better health care system ?
And our organization helps women across that bridge .
Our organization works on three levels .
The second , communities -- empowering women .
They become leaders within their communities .
We need to change attitudes to women in Africa .
We have to do that .
Our health care systems are broken .
What &apos;s extraordinary is how simple the premise is .
Mothers with HIV caring for mothers with HIV .
Past patients taking care of present patients .
And empowerment through employment -- reducing stigma .
Each person must know their HIV status .
Those who are HIV-negative must know how to stay negative .
MB : Simple solutions to complex problems .
Mothers caring for mothers .
It &apos;s transformational .
Thank you .
Jenna McCarthy : What you don &apos;t know about marriage
and not to have sex with anyone else , ever .
He buys a ring , she buys a dress .
They go shopping for all sorts of things .
She takes him to Arthur Murray for ballroom dancing lessons .
And the big day comes .
You know , because they can &apos;t hear the snoring anymore .
Of course , the other half won &apos;t , right ?
And researchers want to know why .
So what &apos;s going on when it doesn &apos;t ?
What are they doing right ?
What can we learn from them ?
Obvious , right .
For example , the happy wife .
These are couples who can find good in any situation .
Because we needed a study to tell us this .
But here &apos;s what &apos;s going on here .
Here &apos;s an interesting one .
This is an actual study , and let me clarify .
Oh no .
So what else can you do to safeguard your marriage ?
Do not win an Oscar for best actress .
I &apos;m serious .
They actually call it the Oscar curse .
Drinking alcohol , it seems , is bad for your marriage .
Yeah .
But here &apos;s a scary one : Divorce is contagious .
We &apos;re healthier , physically and emotionally .
We produce happier , more stable and more successful kids .
So I &apos;m obviously going to need fatten him up .
So we have to keep an eye on that .
And we do like a cocktail or two .
So I &apos;ve got all those things going for me .
I &apos;ll see you at the bar .
John Maeda : How art , technology and design inform creative leaders
Do you know about the parent-teacher conference ?
And he kind of nodded , you know ?
And that always stuck with me all my life .
As you remember , the Apple II did nothing at all .
It would say you &apos;re wrong most of the time .
That was the computer we knew .
It was called the Human Powered Computer Experiment .
It &apos;s a room broken in two halves .
And the floppy disk drive person wears it .
So starting from technology , technology is a wonderful thing .
And then after a few years , we got CD-quality sound .
And then movies , via CD-ROM . It was amazing .
Remember that excitement ?
You see this little pattern here ?
Well , content is the word up there : fear .
Or fear like this , kind of a nightclub typeface .
Like , we gotta go to Fear .
It &apos;s , like , amazing , right ?
It just changes the same content .
You feel for them .
Or you change the typeface to something like this .
I can never get in there .
Free bold feels like Mandela free .
It &apos;s like , yes , I can be free .
Design does that .
So -- yeah .
So I made a lot of work in the &apos; 90s .
This was a square that responds to sound .
It &apos;s called &quot; Tap , Type , Write . &quot;
It has 10 variations .
There &apos;s a shift .
This is , like , a ring of letters .
It &apos;s peaceful , like that .
Thank you .
Thank you .
And why do we have this facility ?
And the shopkeeper would say , &quot; It &apos;s old . &quot;
And he realized , it isn &apos;t about old or new .
It &apos;s about something in between .
We aren &apos;t functioning so easily anymore .
We aren &apos;t a simple authoritarian regime anymore .
And also &quot; no love . &quot;
So that is authoritarianism .
And what is that , structurally ?
It is now a network instead of a perfect tree .
Someone who &apos;s creative actually loves to learn from mistakes .
And it felt kind of like being president , actually .
How many coffees do you have ?
How often are you calling them , emailing them ?
So these kind of systems , I believe , are important .
They &apos;re targeted social media systems around leaders .
Emiliano Salinas : A civil response to violence
I was born in 1976 .
I grew up in a traditional Mexican family .
Don &apos;t worry .
I think we have a problem in Mexico .
We have a big problem .
I think there &apos;s consensus on this .
No one argues -- we all agree there &apos;s a problem .
Is it the Zetas ? The drug traffickers ? The government ?
Corruption ? Poverty ? Or is it something else ?
I think none of these is the problem .
I don &apos;t mean they don &apos;t deserve attention .
We are a country of victims .
We were victims of the Spaniards .
Then we were victims of the French .
Then we were victims of Don Porfirio .
Then we were victims of the PRI .
Even of Salinas .
And of El Peje .
Hold on ! Wait a minute !
What if none of these things is the problem ?
The problem is not the things we feel victims of .
The problem is that we play the role of victims .
We want to pretend that Mexico has the flu .
But it doesn &apos;t .
Mexico has cancer .
Many people in Mexico are afraid today .
We &apos;re very afraid .
And we &apos;re acting out of that fear .
Does that make streets more or less safe ?
Less safe !
We need to confront this fear .
For many people , acting involves courage .
We go from fear to courage .
They say , &quot; I can &apos;t take it anymore .
Let &apos;s do something about it . &quot;
Usually it &apos;s one or two a year .
Now we &apos;re experiencing one every week .
It means it &apos;s determined and effective , but not violent .
There are examples of this kind of action in Mexico .
So what did they do ?
We &apos;ll be waiting for you right here . &quot;
They stayed there .
Of course , criminals can respond .
And in this case , they did .
On July 7th , 2009 , Benjamín Le Barón was murdered .
But he keeps fighting .
He keeps organizing .
He keeps mobilizing .
These heroic acts are present all over the country .
And they &apos;re out there !
They just have to raise their hands .
That devotion we feel for the national football team .
A mother is the most sacred thing in life .
We are going through the darkest moment in our recent history .
What are we going to do ?
Masiosare , the strange enemy , is here .
Where is the soldier in each son ?
Today in Mexico we &apos;re asking for Gandhis .
We need Ghandis .
We &apos;re facing a very powerful opponent .
But we are many more .
They can take a man &apos;s life .
Anyone can kill me , or you , or you .
But no one can kill the spirit of true Mexicans .
Thank you .
Evelyn Glennie : How to truly listen
That &apos;s my only real aim in life .
So technically , I can actually read this .
I will do exactly as I &apos;m told .
There &apos;s nothing too difficult about the piece .
I &apos;m being told where to play on the drum .
I &apos;m being told which part of the stick to use .
And I &apos;m being told the dynamic .
Snares on , snares off .
Now my career may last a little longer !
Just the basic feeling .
However , that is simply not enough .
And I think what Herbie said -- please listen , listen .
We have to listen to ourselves , first of all .
By holding it tightly , I feel strangely more detached .
And I &apos;m doing far , far less .
Not just translate them , but interpret them .
that of a difference . Then gradually ... and gradually ...
They &apos;re all different .
Same amount of weight , but different sound colors .
And I just couldn &apos;t quite accept that .
No circumstances at all were used to refuse any entry .
I have the sound coming this way .
He would have the sound coming through the resonators .
If there were no resonators on here , we would have ...
Can you hear anything ?
Exactly . Because I &apos;m not even touching it .
But yet , we get the sensation of something happening .
Do you see what I mean ?
Whatever the eye sees , then there &apos;s always sound happening .
May be great there , but terrible up there .
And this is quite interesting .
In another year &apos;s time , three extra steps .
Those are hugely important aspects to think about .
I &apos;m assuming we &apos;ve all experienced thunder .
Audience : No .
Evelyn Glennie : Well then , stop clapping . Try again .
Try again . Snow .
See , you &apos;re awake .
Rain . Not bad . Not bad .
Now -- great imagination , thank you very much .
Maybe I can use my jewelry to create extra sounds .
So we never , ever dealt with actual study books .
And that &apos;s exactly what he did .
We had to study from study books .
You know . I need to say something .
&quot; Why am I practicing paradiddles ?
They &apos;re experiencing that rawness there .
But thank you very much for having me !
Adam Sadowsky : How to engineer a viral music video
Hi there .
Some of you may recognize this image .
This is the opening frame of the video that we created .
50-million-plus views on YouTube .
A fantastically viral and wonderful video .
So we were really excited about working with them .
They wanted the machine action to follow the song feeling .
They wanted us to make use of the space .
It included an exterior loading dock .
They wanted it messy , and we were happy to oblige .
The machine itself would start the music .
And the machine would maintain synchronization throughout .
Okay .
They wanted it to end precisely on time .
Okay .
The machine itself has 89 distinct interactions .
We destroyed two pianos and 10 televisions in the process .
We went to Home Depot well over a hundred times .
And it &apos;s actually in the machine .
So what did we learn from all of this ?
And we learned that small stuff stinks .
What else ? Planning is incredibly important .
And so while planning is important , so is flexibility .
Again , small to large is relevant here .
Life can be messy .
There were incredibly difficult moments in the building of this thing .
Months were spent in this tiny , cold warehouse .
Thank you very much .
OK Go : An introduction . Hello TEDxUSC .
We are OK Go .
It think we can do better than this . Hello TEDxUSC .
I mean , &quot; Curiosity &quot; -- excuse me .
Let me start again .
Tim &apos;s sundial hat .
Sorry , start again .
Dogs .
That one &apos;s pretty good . It &apos;s getting better .
James Hansen : Why I must speak out about climate change
And what would you do if you knew what I know ?
Let &apos;s start with how I got to this point .
Did it mean that Venus had an ionosphere ?
Or was Venus extremely hot ?
And it was kept hot by a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere .
Its changes will affect all of humanity .
I worked with other scientists to analyze Earth climate observations .
All of these impacts or are now well under way .
There will be stronger storms and greater flooding .
Most of the things mentioned in our 1981 paper were facts .
But energy policies continued to focus on finding more fossil fuels .
By then we had two grandchildren , Sophie and Connor .
But there were consequences .
So the key quantity is Earth &apos;s energy imbalance .
Is there more energy coming in than going out ?
If so , more warming is in the pipeline .
It will occur without adding any more greenhouse gasses .
That &apos;s how much extra energy Earth is gaining each day .
Yet , there was more energy coming in than going out .
Now consider Earth &apos;s climate history .
But that lag is exactly what is expected .
And more CO2 causes more warming .
The physics does not change .
There is evidence that feedbacks are already beginning .
Methane is also beginning to escape from the permafrost .
What sea level rise can we look forward to ?
Where you are sitting now would be under water .
Ice sheets would continue to disintegrate for centuries .
There would be no stable shoreline .
The economic consequences are almost unthinkable .
Hundreds of New Orleans-like devastations around the world .
Global warming is already affecting people .
More grandchildren helped me along .
Jake is a super-positive , enthusiastic boy .
Several top economists are coauthors on this proposition .
Does not enlarge government .
Leaves energy decisions to individual choices .
Sounds like a conservative climate plan . &quot;
A large fraction of species will be committed to extinction .
Imagine a giant asteroid on a direct collision course with Earth .
That is the equivalent of what we face now .
But we aren &apos;t even starting .
Clearly , I haven &apos;t gotten this message across .
The science is clear .
We owe it to our children and grandchildren .
Thank you .
Laura Snyder : The Philosophical Breakfast Club
An elderly , white-haired man stands up .
They &apos;re even more shocked by what he says .
&quot; You must stop calling yourselves natural philosophers . &quot;
The crowd grew angry and began to complain loudly .
What were scientists called before ?
These were brilliant , driven men who accomplished amazing things .
Richard Jones became an important economist who later influenced Karl Marx .
The members of the philosophical breakfast club disagreed .
The philosophical breakfast club changed that , working together .
The four men really helped each other in every way .
It had a separate memory and central processor .
So the philosophical breakfast club helped invent the modern scientist .
That &apos;s the heroic part of their story .
There &apos;s a flip side as well .
They did not foresee at least one consequence of their revolution .
Thank you .
Zach Kaplan + Keith Schacht : Toys and materials from the future
Zach Kaplan : Keith and I lead a research team .
For me , I really love this idea .
Do you have a need for speed ?
Aqua Rocket : coming this summer .
So I just want to quickly explain how this would work .
This is the magnetically-levitating board that they mentioned in the commercial .
Now this is important for two reasons .
Now , you see the magnet fell really slowly .
There &apos;re a few different versions of it .
Some of them automatically unroll like this one .
I &apos;d make my very own walking stick .
An olive server .
Some type of extension pole -- like what the painters use .
You sir , come on up .
Come on up . Tell everybody your name .
Steve Jurvetson : Steve .
Right there . That &apos;s great .
And hold onto this . Good luck to you .
No , not yet .
Little bit -- that &apos;s perfect , just perfect .
SJ : It &apos;s cold .
It &apos;s so safe you could drink this stuff .
All right , well thanks for coming up .
SJ : Excellent , thank you .
So what &apos;s the significance of this dry liquid ?
You can circulate it to draw the heat away .
While he was doing this , he noticed an unexpected thing .
We have a video to show you .
It &apos;s technically called , &quot; shape-retaining property . &quot;
Now , think about your interactions with aluminum foil .
This could totally change the way that you interface with paper .
Old Milk Carton : Oh yeah , it smells good .
Who are you ?
New Milk Carton : I &apos;m New Milk .
OMC : I used to smell like you .
Fresh Watch , from Inventables Dairy Farms .
Packaging that changes color when your milk &apos;s gone off .
Don &apos;t let milk spoil your morning .
And these dyes change color in response to odors .
This can radically improve the way that doctors diagnose patients .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Rose George : Let &apos;s talk crap . Seriously .
Let &apos;s talk dirty .
That &apos;s the other WTO .
2.5 billion people worldwide have no adequate toilet .
They don &apos;t have a bucket or a box .
Forty percent of the world with no adequate toilet .
Fifty communicable diseases like to travel in human shit .
It &apos;s the runs , the Hershey squirts , the squits .
Still not sure about the bikini .
And here &apos;s another image of diarrhea .
This is Marie Saylee , nine months old .
And that &apos;s her dad .
It &apos;s a very potent weapon of mass destruction .
These are cholera beds in Haiti .
But we know how to fix this .
It &apos;s a wonderful waste disposal device .
We don &apos;t have a neutral word for it .
Poop &apos;s not particularly adequate .
Shit offends people . Feces is too medical .
No one &apos;s going to refuse clean water .
So a toilet can put a girl back in school .
And I understand that . Who can blame them ?
That &apos;s not the only thing it can do for you .
Poop can cook your dinner .
It &apos;s got nutrients in it .
We ingest nutrients . We excrete nutrients as well .
We don &apos;t keep them all .
There is now a new career path called stool donor .
It &apos;s like the new sperm donor .
She &apos;s been suffering for years .
It &apos;s astonishing , but hardly anyone is still doing it .
Maybe it &apos;s the ick factor .
So the idea is to manipulate human emotion .
They tried selling soap as healthy . No one bought it .
They tried selling it as sexy . Everyone bought it .
It &apos;s called &quot; No Loo , No I Do . &quot;
She &apos;d grown up with a latrine .
It was no big deal , but it was a latrine .
She was scared of snakes . She was scared of rape .
After three days , she did an unthinkable thing .
She left .
But not just that .
Kids were dying of diarrhea and cholera .
That &apos;s what really made them change their behavior .
But there are things to worry about .
It &apos;s the most off-track Millennium Development Goal .
It &apos;s about 50 or so years off track .
They &apos;ve made it conversational .
People go out and upgrade their toilet .
They talk about it . They &apos;ve sanitized it .
Our sewers are crumbling .
Things are going wrong here too .
The solution to all of this is pretty easy .
Thank you .
Frank Gehry : My days as a young rebel
I &apos;m going to go right into the slides .
Let me go right into the slides .
Can you turn off the light ? Down .
I like to be in the dark .
This is in Venice .
And then I did a law school for Loyola in downtown L.A.
And we continue to work with this client .
They wanted a sense of place .
And the success of it threw me for a loop .
So , nobody would like this .
And after we failed , I just kept failing .
So , it was an accidental discovery .
I got into fish .
And so I started making these funny things .
I did this building in Japan .
And I love sake and Kobe and all that stuff .
And the client said , &quot; Why no fish ? &quot;
But he was right -- I couldn &apos;t do the tail .
It was pretty hard .
And I put them together , and you walk between them .
It was a dialog with the context again .
Couldn &apos;t find it .
So ...
This was built in six months .
We made the drawings of the fish and the scales .
I played with it in the evening .
And the next night , we had gefilte fish .
It was a joke .
I play with funny people like &#91; Claes &#93; Oldenburg .
We &apos;ve been friends for a long time .
And we &apos;ve started to work on things .
He was the Swiss Army knife .
P for Palladio .
The highlight of the performance was at the end .
And I can tell you -- it &apos;s totally an Oldenburg .
I had nothing to do with it .
We made it into a sailing craft .
People hate it .
And I &apos;m always drawn to that .
But Claes made homage to it in the Loyola Law School .
And that chain link is really expensive .
It &apos;s in perspective and everything .
And then we did a camp together for children with cancer .
And you can see , we started making a building together .
Of course , the milk can is his .
And he pushed that .
It made my building look sick .
It led to the building on the left .
I just tell the stories .
And it &apos;s just a complex of factory buildings .
It &apos;s copper and galvanize .
I spent a lot of time undoing Richard Meier &apos;s aesthetic .
And they end up looking like stone .
This is the central area .
There &apos;s a ramp .
Stanley was instrumental in my getting this job .
And so Stanley did the little dome thing .
And we did it over the phone and by fax .
He would send me a fax and show me something .
I don &apos;t want the tower . &quot;
And so I decided to put him in a depression .
And he put these two bridges with pink guardrails on it .
And so then I put this big billboard behind it .
And I call it , &quot; David and Goliath . &quot;
And that &apos;s my cafeteria .
In Boston , we had that old building on the left .
Instead of , like , copper in 10 or 15 .
I flew in one night and took this picture .
And the shape fit perfectly .
I just joined the points .
In the curved part there &apos;s all the mechanical equipment .
This is a small house somewhere .
It &apos;s in the West Valley .
These are the models .
It &apos;s kind of like a whole built town .
I thought it was fitting for me to be doing that .
He was too busy .
He didn &apos;t recommend me , by the way .
Is it going to look like this beautiful estate is sub-divided ?
Etc. etc .
You &apos;ve got the idea .
And so we finally ended up making it .
These people are art collectors .
And the building is very sculptural as you walk around it .
I keep trying to make it work .
In this case we learned how to detail it .
In Cleveland , there &apos;s Burnham Mall , on the left .
It &apos;s never been finished .
There &apos;s a railroad track .
And the centerline of the mall goes out .
You drive down .
So it &apos;s about a 10-story C-clamp .
This owner has a pet peeve about bad automobile entries .
And this would be a hotel .
It &apos;s hard to do high-rise .
I feel much more comfortable down here .
This is a piece of property in Brentwood .
And that &apos;s it , built .
The dome was a request from the client .
She wanted a dome somewhere in the house .
She didn &apos;t care where .
And it &apos;s very private .
The landscape is being built around to create a private garden .
These aren &apos;t focused very well .
I don &apos;t know how to do it from here .
Focus the one on the right .
It &apos;s up there .
Left -- it &apos;s my right .
That &apos;s the living room .
Servants &apos; quarters .
This is the bedroom .
It looks like I got a Baldessari painting for free .
This is for Michael Eisner -- Disney .
We &apos;re doing some work for him .
Kind of a fun thing to do .
And we struggled with the image .
This is in Paris , along the Seine .
Palais des Sports , the Gare de Lyon over here .
There &apos;s a new library across the river .
They call it the plan coupe .
These are the models for it .
Apartments , etc .
And these are the kind of study models we did .
And the one on the left is pretty awful .
The restaurants here -- the apartments and the theater , etc .
And it faces into a park .
And this will be some kind of high-tech billboard .
I don &apos;t know what to do .
And it &apos;s got a fish .
It &apos;s like a drug addict .
And then I do it .
There it is .
But it &apos;s the living room .
We &apos;ve had a lot of fun working together .
So far .
This is a shopping thing .
And another restaurant .
It &apos;s plaster and just zinc .
I know I &apos;m over time .
See , that skylight goes down and becomes that one .
So it &apos;s pretty quiet inside .
This is the Disney Hall -- the concert hall .
It &apos;s a complicated project .
It has a chamber hall .
And the plan of this -- it &apos;s a concert hall .
There &apos;s commercial at the ground floor .
But finally , there &apos;s a hotel there .
And we studied many models .
This was our original model .
Everybody liked the surround .
That &apos;s the idea .
But you get the sense of the hall in section .
Most halls come straight down into a proscenium .
And so it will be quite a different shape .
And this is a teapot I designed for Alessi .
I just stuck it on there .
Larry Halprin is doing the stairs .
And we split these bridges .
Originally , this was all solid with a hole in it .
And finally , I just threw these in -- Lou Danziger .
A little studio -- and it &apos;s sadly for sale .
Time goes on .
It didn &apos;t work .
Thank you very much .
Nicholas Negroponte : Taking OLPC to Colombia
So , in rough numbers , there are a million laptops .
In Colombia , we have about 3,000 laptops .
And suddenly , the kids have connected laptops .
They &apos;ve leapfrogged .
Before , they were closed off .
Now what are some of the results ?
Probably the most important thing we see is children teaching parents .
They own the laptops . They take them home .
Her mother had not gone to primary school .
This is an education project , not a laptop project .
And then we can actually roll out large numbers .
And think of the laptop as a vaccine .
You don &apos;t vaccinate a few children .
You vaccinate all the children in an area .
Nate Silver : Does racism affect how you vote ?
I want to talk about the election .
And in fact Barack Obama did quite well .
He won 375 electoral votes .
One exception is in Massachusetts .
That was John Kerry &apos;s home state .
He lost badly but every Democrat does .
He lost no worse than most people do .
But yeah , what &apos;s the matter with Arkansas ?
And the answer is : it is at least partially fair .
They asked this question .
Here is the same data on a map .
So we have to ask why .
Is racism predictable in some way ?
Is there something driving this ?
Or are there more systematic factors at work ?
And so we can look at a bunch of different variables .
And you see the relationship there with the racially-based voting patterns .
So yes , racism is predictable .
This is conducted by the University of Chicago every other year .
And they ask a series of really interesting questions .
In 2000 they had particularly interesting questions about racial attitudes .
There is a big difference .
Just based on who lives in your immediate neighborhood around you .
So it &apos;s really not even about urban versus rural .
It &apos;s about who you live with .
I &apos;m a big fan of cities .
So we can think more about things like street grids .
Denis Dutton : A Darwinian theory of beauty
It &apos;s in the eye of the beholder .
It &apos;s whatever moves you personally .
Beethoven is adored in Japan .
Peruvians love Japanese woodblock prints .
How can we explain this universality ?
I mean fossils , cave paintings and so forth .
It did not evolve for natural survival .
In fact , it goes against natural survival .
It &apos;s quite a familiar story .
It &apos;s women who actually push history forward .
He actually used that word .
It would hardly do to eat your baby or your lover .
But , someone might argue , that &apos;s natural beauty .
How about artistic beauty ?
Isn &apos;t that exhaustively cultural ?
No , I don &apos;t think it is .
But artistic and decorative skills are actually much older than that .
But the most intriguing prehistoric artifacts are older even than this .
I have in mind the so-called Acheulian hand axes .
They go back about two-and-a-half-million years .
What were these artifacts for ?
Yes , hairstyling -- I insist on that .
We find beauty in something done well .
Is beauty in the eye of the beholder ?
No , it &apos;s deep in our minds .
Thank you .
Once upon a time , there was a place called Lesterland .
Now Lesterland looks a lot like the United States .
Now , Lesters in Lesterland have this extraordinary power .
There are two elections every election cycle in Lesterland .
One is called the general election .
The other is called the Lester election .
And here &apos;s the trick .
Now , what can we say about democracy in Lesterland ?
Okay . That &apos;s Lesterland .
Number one , the United States is Lesterland .
The United States is Lesterland .
But you must do extremely well .
Now you say , really ?
Really .05 percent ?
In this sense , the funders are our Lesters .
Now , what can we say about this democracy in USA-land ?
Okay , the United States is Lesterland , point number one .
Here &apos;s point number two .
I don &apos;t mean Rod Blagojevich sense of corruption .
I don &apos;t mean any criminal act .
The corruption I &apos;m talking about is perfectly legal .
So here &apos;s the model of government .
This is a corruption .
So the right wants smaller government .
But here &apos;s the bad news .
Block reform .
It feeds on dysfunction .
This is the root .
Okay , now , every single one of you knows this .
You ignore it . This is an impossible problem .
But we cannot ignore this corruption anymore .
We need a government that works .
There will never be a Christmas .
Okay . So how do we do it ?
Turns out , the analytics here are easy , simple .
The analytics are easy here .
Now I get this skepticism .
I get this cynicism . I get this sense of impossibility .
But I don &apos;t buy it .
This is a solvable issue .
You don &apos;t wake up one day no longer a racist .
But this is a problem of just incentives , just incentives .
Irrelevant .
There &apos;s nothing we can do . &quot;
When she said that , I scrambled .
What is that sense of hopelessness ? &quot;
And what hit me was an image of my six-year-old son .
Nothing you can do . &quot;
So would I do nothing ?
I &apos;m going off to build Google Glass .
So here &apos;s my question : Do you have that love ?
Do you have that love ?
A republic . A representative democracy .
A government dependent upon the people alone .
We have lost that republic .
All of us have to act to get it back .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
Gary Greenberg : The beautiful nano details of our world
As we go smaller , here is a human hair .
It &apos;s about a tenth of a millimeter .
That &apos;s how small that is .
This is a ring of cobalt atoms .
So sand is about a tenth of a millimeter in size .
It &apos;s really quite amazing . You have microshells there .
You have things like coral .
You have fragments of other shells . You have olivine .
An amazing array of incredible things exist in sand .
There &apos;s some sand that &apos;s really much more colorful .
Every grain of sand is coming somewhere and going somewhere .
They &apos;re like a snapshot in time .
And you can see those in micrometeorites .
And I started taking pictures with my three-dimensional microscopes .
So sort of left-eye view , right-eye view .
And that &apos;s called a ring agglutinate .
Thank you .
Edith Widder : The weird , wonderful world of bioluminescence
But mostly I &apos;m entranced by it .
I needed some way to share the experience directly .
This is the first time it has ever been recorded .
Oops . Sorry .
Okay .
Well , it uses it to defend itself from its predators .
The flash is like a scream for help .
It &apos;s got a light organ under its eye .
It &apos;s got a chin barbel .
It &apos;s unbelievable .
The light organs under the eyes are flashing .
That chin barbel is flashing .
It &apos;s phenomenal .
There &apos;s other ways you can defend yourself with light .
This blinds or distracts the predator .
It &apos;s phenomenal .
They &apos;re things like this .
This is a golden coral , a bush .
It grows very slowly .
The other reason is this amazing bush glows .
And you see things like this .
And these are flytrap anemones .
Now if you poke it , it pulls in its tentacles .
And it actually ends up looking like a galaxy .
There are starfish that can make light .
Colorization and sound effects added for you viewing pleasure .
But we have no idea why it does that .
Here &apos;s another one . This is also a sea pen .
It &apos;s got a brittle star hitching a ride .
It &apos;s a green saber of light .
This is an optical lure that I &apos;ve used .
We call it the electronic jellyfish .
So the camera &apos;s black and white .
It &apos;s not high-resolution .
And right in the front is the electronic jellyfish .
There &apos;s something small there that responds .
We &apos;re talking to something .
And this was very consistent .
This was in the Bahamas at about 2,000 feet .
But the cool thing is , we &apos;re talking to it .
We don &apos;t know what we &apos;re saying .
Personally , I think it &apos;s something sexy .
We &apos;ve only just begun to analyze all of this data .
That &apos;s a 12-foot-long giant sixgill shark .
And this is a burglar alarm .
This is at 3,000 feet in Monterey Canyon .
It &apos;s supposed to be attacking what &apos;s attacking the jellyfish .
But we did see a bunch of responses like this .
This guy is a little more contemplative .
&quot; Hey , wait a minute .
There &apos;s supposed to be something else there . &quot;
He &apos;s thinking about it .
But he &apos;s persistent .
He keeps coming back .
Nope .
We need more eyes on the process .
But I warn you , it &apos;s addictive .
Thank you .
Vusi Mahlasela : &quot; Thula Mama &quot;
This is your place , you stay here . &quot;
And they left .
Gary Lauder &apos;s new traffic sign : Take Turns
I &apos;ve had some time to think it over .
Fifty percent of crashes happen at intersections .
Roundabouts are much better .
But that &apos;s just safety .
What about time and gas ?
Small roundabouts are starting to appear .
But they are not applicable in all situations .
So , take , for example , the three-way intersection .
But the other two are somewhat questionable .
Cars rarely appear on that third road .
What &apos;s that time worth ?
is $ 20 an hour . That is 60,000 per year .
And you &apos;d still come out ahead .
Can that be accomplished with existing signs ?
So , why not use a yield sign ?
That would not work .
And it merges the stop sign and yield signs .
And uncertainty results in caution .
So , now that you are all &quot; Road Scholars &quot; ...
Maira Kalman : The illustrated woman
And I was writing terrible poetry and knitting sweaters for him .
And we started a studio .
You have to condense a story into 32 pages , usually .
And the Bertoia chair in the background is my favorite chair .
And the books are really journals of my life .
I never -- I don &apos;t like plots .
I don &apos;t know what a plot means .
The letter C had other things in it .
Who are these people ? What are these tribes ?
They &apos;re not . &quot;
I said , people should know about this book .
Do you mind my asking a question ? &quot;
I happen to know it for a fact .
You don &apos;t even know .
&quot; And decided his top people had to be extinctified . &quot;
Too many pogroms .
Facts were actually banished from our home .
So , it &apos;s a miracle that I &apos;m here today .
Well , not so awful .
There &apos;s consoling .
And he says , &quot; It is impossible not to lie .
It is February and not lying is impossible . &quot;
How do we know when we are ourselves ?
I &apos;m going to quickly go through this .
A complicated question .
Oh my God , you know what ?
Could we have -- no , we don &apos;t have time .
Do you have that ?
And she said , &quot; I knew it was he . &quot;
Gershwin died at the age of 38 .
He &apos;s buried in the same cemetery as my husband .
I don &apos;t want to talk about that now .
And I would like to run it for them .
And a woman who lives on our street , Lolita .
And then I go and have some tea .
That &apos;s actually Hy .
Gabe Barcia-Colombo : My DNA vending machine
This is a vending machine in Los Angeles .
It &apos;s a caviar vending machine .
You can kind of tell from their reactions .
And so I started doing this regularly .
This is what that looked like .
And I hadn &apos;t even thought about that .
And so I thought that was interesting .
Here it is .
And how much will these samples be worth ?
And will you buy someone else &apos;s sample ?
And what will you be able to do with that sample ?
Thank you .
Dan Dennett : The illusion of consciousness
But they probably don &apos;t think of these opinions as expertise .
They &apos;re just strongly held opinions .
Simply by being conscious , I know all about this . &quot;
No , you &apos;ve got it all wrong . &quot;
And they say this with an amazing confidence .
That &apos;s the order of the day here .
Now , this nice picture shows a thought-balloon , a thought-bubble .
I think everybody understands what that means .
That &apos;s supposed to exhibit the stream of consciousness .
And this fellow here is looking at the painting by Braque .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re made of .
It speaks so eloquently to the problem .
Real consciousness is not a bag of tricks .
Don &apos;t tell me the answer . &quot;
But I &apos;m not going to explain it all to you .
I &apos;m going to do what philosophers do .
Here &apos;s how a philosopher explains the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick .
You know the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick ?
&quot; He merely makes you think that he does . &quot;
So now I &apos;m going to illustrate how philosophers explain consciousness .
He didn &apos;t even try to do those things .
People &apos;s memories inflate what they think they saw .
And the same is true of consciousness .
Watch it carefully .
We &apos;re looking for a backer .
It &apos;s a feature-length documentary on consciousness .
OK , now , you all saw what changed , right ?
That &apos;s the detail part .
It doesn &apos;t seem that way , does it ?
You &apos;re getting in a lot less information than you think .
It &apos;s in the museum in North Carolina .
Bellotto was a student of Canaletto &apos;s .
And as I got closer and closer , I actually screamed .
There were just little artfully placed blobs of paint .
I &apos;ll just give that to you one more time .
Well , remember the philosopher &apos;s explanation of the lady ?
It &apos;s the same thing .
It &apos;s just making you expect the detail .
Let &apos;s just do this experiment very quickly .
Yes .
How do you know that &apos;s what you did ?
Yes , it &apos;s possible to do that .
But the details of the process are still in significant controversy .
You don &apos;t know how you do it .
You just know that you have certain beliefs .
And what explains the fact that that &apos;s what you think ?
Can you see it ?
It &apos;s a Necker cube .
Can you see the four ways of seeing the cube ?
Because there &apos;s another way of seeing it .
Does your brain have to send little painters in there ?
But Rob Van Lier has recently shown that it isn &apos;t .
Let me just pause this for a second if I can .
This is change-blindness .
So , show the original picture for 240 milliseconds . Blank .
Show the next picture for 240 milliseconds . Blank .
So now we &apos;re going to be subjects in the experiment .
We &apos;re going to start easy . Some examples .
No trouble there .
Can everybody see ? All right .
Can you see that one ?
2.9 seconds .
How many don &apos;t see it still ?
What &apos;s on the roof of that barn ?
It &apos;s easy .
Is it a bridge or a dock ?
I want you to see a few that are particularly striking .
Can you see it ?
Audience : Yes .
How many engines on the wing of that Boeing ?
Right in the middle of the picture !
Thanks very much for your attention .
And he &apos;s right . This is a problem .
If you work on one neuron , that &apos;s neuroscience .
If you work on two neurons , that &apos;s psychology . &quot;
Thank you very much .
Actually , it &apos;s deceptively large .
Obviously a very small community .
There were only two other Dannys on the Internet then .
I knew them both .
So I could have anything I wanted other than bbn.com and symbolics.com.
Maybe I should register a few extras just in case .
It was incredibly successful .
My rough calculation is it would be about 25 miles thick .
I &apos;ll come back to that later .
Now , there was an interesting thing that happened last April .
So for a few hours , it all passed through China .
Imagine how vulnerable the system is to deliberate attacks .
That will not succeed .
Nobody has claimed credit for that .
There was basically a factory of industrial machines .
It didn &apos;t think of itself as being on the Internet .
Everything started breaking .
Now , of course you couldn &apos;t do that today .
It &apos;s constantly changing . It &apos;s constantly reconfiguring .
But so what we need is a plan B.
There is no plan B right now .
This doesn &apos;t need to be a multi-billion-dollar government project .
It &apos;s basically a matter of deciding to do it .
It &apos;s not that hard a problem .
It could definitely be done by people in this room .
Thank you very much .
Stefan Larsson : What doctors can learn from each other
It &apos;s a big part of the national budgets .
And many different reforms aim at holding back this growth .
So no wonder that some of my old colleagues are frustrated .
We call this value-based healthcare .
The differences were dramatic .
That &apos;s a huge difference , a seven-fold difference .
And often , the data actually doesn &apos;t exist .
Nobody knows .
So going the hospital is a lottery .
They all realized they had their individual way of operating .
And they finally agreed .
Everybody saw this makes a lot of sense .
Since then , they publish every year .
Now I found this principle really exciting .
Continuous improvement .
Now , that &apos;s not the only exciting part .
That &apos;s exciting in itself .
We did a study where we looked at OECD data .
They were always best in class .
We were always best in class .
But most of them don &apos;t know .
But physicians have another characteristic .
They actually thrive from peer recognition .
They will share the information on how to improve .
This is happening in reality .
It stands for the International Consortium for Health Outcome Measurement .
Compare apples to apples . Who &apos;s better ?
Why is that ?
The group discussed , how do we measure quality today ?
Can we measure it better than we do ?
There was an enormous energy in the room .
There were so many ideas , so much enthusiasm .
Thank you .
Brian Cox : Why we need the explorers
We live in difficult and challenging economic times , of course .
This is the U.K. government spend .
You see there , it &apos;s about 620 billion a year .
That funds everything in the U.K.
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re arguing about .
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re arguing about .
So it isn &apos;t in the series .
It &apos;s of the moon Enceladus .
It &apos;s about 500 kilometers in diameter .
So , tiny moon .
What &apos;s fascinating and beautiful ...
It &apos;s a beautiful graphic .
That &apos;s one more picture of Enceladus .
This is when Cassini flew beneath Enceladus .
It &apos;s actually an ice moon .
It could be hundreds of kilometers deep , we think .
Tremendous and beautiful discovery .
Well , there is .
Earthrise from Apollo 8 .
The biggest one was in 1975 by Chase Econometrics .
So exploration can pay for itself .
What about scientific discovery ?
What about driving innovation ?
Well , this looks like a picture of virtually nothing .
And they saw strange pictures like this .
And the electrons can only be in particular places .
I just wanted to show this picture because this is remarkable .
This is actually a picture of the spectrum of the Sun .
But look at the number of black lines in that spectrum .
And that &apos;s why helium &apos;s called helium .
It &apos;s called &quot; helios &quot; -- helios from the Sun .
That &apos;s a limit imposed on the mass of stars .
That &apos;s quite an incredible prediction .
Well , this is a picture of it .
It &apos;s just one of billions of galaxies in the universe .
So that star is also 50 million light years away .
That &apos;s a Type Ia supernova explosion .
It &apos;s called a carbon-oxygen dwarf .
In fact , that one is a carbon-oxygen dwarf .
So , I think science can be -- serendipity is important .
It can be beautiful . It can reveal quite astonishing things .
This is a spectacular picture of our home planet .
Now , it doesn &apos;t look like our home planet .
It looks like Saturn because , of course , it is .
It was taken by the Cassini space probe .
And if I blow it up there , you see it .
That &apos;s our planet from 750 million miles away .
The Voyager is a tiny machine .
But it visited Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus and Neptune .
And it took this picture of Earth .
That &apos;s Earth from four billion miles away .
He said , &quot; Consider again that dot .
That &apos;s here . That &apos;s home . That &apos;s us .
Beautiful words about the power of science and exploration .
And it &apos;s made today in these difficult economic times .
Surely , we know enough .
We don &apos;t need to discover anything else about our universe .
He was clearly under assault all the time .
&quot; We know enough at the turn of the 19th century .
Just exploit it ; just build things . &quot;
Thank you .
Janna Levin : The sound the universe makes
The Sun burns our peripheral vision .
We see light reflected off the Moon .
Now black holes are dark against a dark sky .
We can &apos;t see them directly .
They destroy stars around them .
They churn up debris in their surroundings .
But they won &apos;t come to us directly through light .
It was Einstein &apos;s great general theory of relativity .
Now even light will be bent by those paths .
These are the natural curves in space .
And even light could not escape this current .
This is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions .
But Einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical oddity .
He did not believe they existed in nature .
He thought nature would protect us from their formation .
Now our Sun will not collapse to a black hole .
It &apos;s actually not massive enough .
But basically that &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about .
It cannot hide behind the black hole .
So you can &apos;t hide anything behind a black hole .
They can see you .
They can be spinning hundreds of times a second .
This was one of the groups .
You would literally hear the sound .
And we can predict what the sound will be .
Then it &apos;s gone .
At home it sounds kind of anticlimactic .
It &apos;s sort of like ding , ding , ding .
This is another sound from my group .
Want to get away from the sound .
Both black holes are moving .
Both black holes are getting closer together .
In this case , they &apos;re both wobbling quite a lot .
And then they &apos;re going to merge .
Now it &apos;s gone .
Now that &apos;s our prediction for what we &apos;ll see .
In this Hubble image , we see two galaxies .
They look like they &apos;re frozen in some embrace .
But they &apos;re not frozen ; they &apos;re actually merging .
It might make a sound .
So imagine you &apos;re inside the Big Bang .
Imagine a billion years ago , two black holes collided .
That song has been ringing through space for all that time .
We weren &apos;t even here .
It &apos;s like hurry , build your instruments .
It &apos;s getting closer and closer , and in 20 ...
It &apos;s a terrible sound .
It &apos;s literally the definition of noise .
It &apos;s white noise ; it &apos;s such a chaotic ringing .
I mean we have to ask , has it happened before ?
Will it happen again ?
Here &apos;s my multiverse creatures .
Thank you . Thank you .
Joe Kowan : How I beat stage fright
Joe Kowan : I have stage fright .
And it didn &apos;t even matter until I was 27 .
I had this irrational fear .
Well , when I got there , it was packed .
There were like 20 people there .
And they all looked angry .
Next your non-essential systems start to shut down , like digestion .
That condition is not conducive to performing folk music .
I mean , your nervous system is an idiot .
I have never been more terrified -- until now .
I mean , it &apos;s a nightmare .
It was so bad .
But that was my first real experience as a solo singer-songwriter .
I couldn &apos;t shake it .
And that &apos;s when I had an epiphany .
So I started writing a song about having stage fright .
Except for when I was really nervous , like now .
Can I have a sip of water ?
Thank you .
Alan Kay : A powerful idea about ideas
He would have a great time .
We go to magic shows in order to be fooled .
They measure very , very carefully .
Somehow we have to understand ourselves to get around our flaws .
We can think of ourselves as kind of a noisy channel .
I &apos;ll talk about that a little bit .
But how simple ?
And that leaves two open areas that are kind of suspicious ...
and bingo . That is all you have to do .
Now let &apos;s go to young children .
You can see the trapezoids are a little challenging there .
So they had created these artifacts .
&quot; What have you noticed about what you did ? &quot;
So that &apos;s what Lauren did .
Well , that &apos;s pretty amazing .
That isn &apos;t what we usually try to teach six-year-olds .
Each time I click it , car turn .
And I can try steering the car here by ...
See the car turn by five here ?
So what if I click this down to zero ?
It goes straight . That &apos;s a big revelation for nine-year-olds .
Make it go in the other direction .
And we &apos;ll call this a wheel .
See this wheel &apos;s heading here ?
And it &apos;s interesting .
And we can reflect here the way Gillian Ishijima did .
What do I get there ? &quot;
We get a visual pattern of what these nine-year-olds called acceleration .
So how do the children do science ?
Student 1 : Ooh , this is nice .
Who &apos;s got the apple ?
Alan Kay : They &apos;ve got little stopwatches .
AK : Stopwatches aren &apos;t accurate enough .
Student 3 : 0.99 seconds .
Teacher : So put &quot; sponge ball &quot; ...
Teacher : Drop . Class : Whoa !
And they say , &quot; Oh , yeah . Constant acceleration .
We &apos;ve done that already . &quot;
But if I oppose gravity , here we go ... Oops !
One more .
Thank you .
Rives : If I controlled the Internet
I just wish it were more organized . &quot;
So ...
You could navigate and understand every emotional intersection .
Listen , you &apos;ll see being dead is dandy .
Now follow me , OK ?
Grandma.com would be a recipe for biscuits and spit-bath instructions .
One , two , three .
That links with hotdiggitydog.com.
That is my grandfather .
They take you to gruff-ex-cop-on-his-fourth-marriage.dad.
I wouldn &apos;t need it .
Huh ? Maybe Google would hire this .
I guess it &apos;s just like life .
We can interfere with the interface .
You don &apos;t say a prayer .
You don &apos;t write a psalm .
You don &apos;t chant an &quot; om . &quot;
Thank you , TED .
Bill Davenhall : Your health depends on where you live
Can geographic information make you healthy ?
In 2001 I got hit by a train .
My train was a heart attack .
&quot; Why now ? &quot; &quot; Why here ? &quot;
&quot; Could my doctor have warned me ? &quot;
Genetics , lifestyle and environment .
Well , I understand the genetics and lifestyle part .
And you know why I understand that ?
Because my physicians constantly ask me questions about this .
What does that mean , my environment ?
Well , it can mean a lot of things .
This is my life . These are my life places .
We all have these .
You spend it at rest and you spend it at work .
I started off in Scranton , Pennsylvania .
OK , so I ended up in Louisville , Kentucky .
They manufacture plastics . They use large quantities chloroprene and benzene .
It was insidious and it was really happening .
And I moved to Redlands California .
Okay ? Almost like the highest in the nation .
So , what &apos;s wrong with this picture ?
They really don &apos;t do that . It &apos;s missing .
Look at the kind of data that &apos;s available .
Now , I &apos;ve circled the places where I &apos;ve been .
So , how many people are in the white ?
Anybody ? Boy you &apos;re lucky .
How many have spent it in the red places ?
Oh , not so lucky .
But none of that &apos;s in my medical record .
And it &apos;s not in yours either .
So , here &apos;s my friend Paul .
And this is where he has spent most of his time .
Anybody got any clues ? Ski . Right .
Did you know that data existed ?
So , our cell phones can now build a place history .
This might be what we end up with .
This could be my little assessment .
What I &apos;d like to leave you for are two prescriptions .
And they &apos;re in the early stages of development .
But it will also be useful for us .
Just look at that for a minute .
That was what he was talking about on that quote .
Gary Wolf : The quantified self
I got up this morning at 6 : 10 a.m.
after going to sleep at 12 : 45 a.m.
I was awakened once during the night .
I had about 600 milligrams of caffeine , zero of alcohol .
This little black dot there is a 3D accelerometer .
It tracks your movement through space .
This tracks your activity and also your sleep .
It has just that sensor in it .
You &apos;re probably familiar with the Nike + system .
And this is the sleep tracking system of today .
This just was presented at a health care conference in D.C.
Here &apos;s a biometric device : a pair of Apple Earbuds .
What is this for ?
What should it be for ?
Some people will say it &apos;s for biometric security .
Some people will say it &apos;s for public health research .
Some people will say it &apos;s for avant-garde marketing research .
Thank you .
You have to make a wish to save the world . &quot;
I was lost .
The world is fucked up .
Except maybe French people .
Whatever .
I can &apos;t do anything to save the world . &quot;
&quot; Oh , all right . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s cool . &quot;
What about art ?
Could art change the world ?
I started when I was 15 years old .
Each trip was an excursion , was an adventure .
I would control it directly with the public in the streets .
So that &apos;s Paris .
That &apos;s on the Champs-Elysees .
I was quite proud of that one .
Then when the photo left , the frame was still there .
November 2005 : the streets are burning .
I mean , these were the faces of my friends .
I know those guys .
So I went back there with a 28 mm lens .
It was the only one I had at that time .
So you can do it only with their trust .
So I took full portraits of people from Le Bosquet .
They were making scary faces to play the caricature of themselves .
That &apos;s where I realized the power of paper and glue .
So could art change the world ?
Are they so different ?
Asked them to make a face as a sign of commitment .
They all accepted to be pasted next to the other .
We launched the biggest illegal art exhibition ever .
We called the project Face 2 Face .
The experts said , &quot; No way .
The people will not accept .
&quot; It will be as big as your house . &quot;
When we did the wall , we did the Palestinian side .
We had all sorts of help from all walks of life .
Okay , for example , that &apos;s Palestine .
We &apos;re in Ramallah right now .
And those ones are actually two taxi-drivers . &quot;
And then there was always a silence .
And most of them couldn &apos;t say .
We even pasted on Israeli military towers , and nothing happened .
The rain and the wind will take them off anyway .
They are not meant to stay .
So the reactions in the street were kind of interesting .
I called that project Women Are Heroes .
I just observed .
Sometimes there was no words , no sentence , just tears .
I just took their pictures and pasted them .
Women Are Heroes took me around the world .
I was shocked .
All Brazil was shocked .
So I decided to go there .
And she said , &quot; You know what ?
We &apos;re hungry for culture .
We need culture out there . &quot;
So I went out and I started with the kids .
But that &apos;s okay .
I wanted them to feel that this art belongs to them .
They were all linked to the three kids that got killed .
I took more photos , and we started the project .
I &apos;m not interested in filming the violence and the weapons .
You see that enough in the media .
What I want to show is the incredible life and energy .
Everyone there understood the project .
And then we pasted everywhere -- the whole hill .
What was interesting is that the media couldn &apos;t get in .
I mean , you should see that .
So how can we know about the project ?
We kept traveling .
In war-torn places like Monrovia , people come straight to you .
Are you an NGO ? Are you the media ? &quot;
Art . Just doing art .
Don &apos;t you have color in France ? &quot;
Some who understood the project would explain it to others .
This is art . &quot;
And then it becomes more .
It becomes a desire , a need , an armor .
Women are always the first ones targeted during conflict .
Then art becomes useful .
So the people kept it .
So I asked the people what happened .
&quot; Oh , that guy just moved . &quot;
When you look at Kibera now , they look back .
Okay , India .
In India it was just impossible to paste .
So we decided to paste white , white on the walls .
So imagine white guys pasting white papers .
Of course , they were confused .
Thank you .
So we didn &apos;t get caught this time .
Each project -- that &apos;s a film from Women Are Heroes .
Okay .
For each project we do a film .
And the photos kept traveling even without us .
Behind each image is a story .
We did that in most of the places .
We go back regularly .
In Kibera , each year we cover more roofs .
And that has always been a central part of the work .
And I was even invited to cover the MOCA museum .
But tell me , advertising for what ?
But they asked me for a promise basically .
So I did . That &apos;s Paris .
That &apos;s Rio .
You understand the full scope of the project .
That &apos;s London .
New York .
And today , they are with you in Long Beach .
In some ways , art can change the world .
Art can change the way we see the world .
Art can create an analogy .
They would be really useful . &quot;
Or , &quot; How can we help ? &quot;
And this starts right now .
Yes , everyone in the room .
Everyone watching .
I wanted that wish to actually start now .
What we see changes who we are .
And this starts right now and depends on you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Suzanne Lee : Grow your own clothes
So we start by brewing the tea .
And then we &apos;re ready to add the living organism .
And along with that , some acetic acid .
We need to maintain an optimum temperature for the growth .
So this is my mini fabric farm .
So they &apos;re spinning these tiny nano fibers of pure cellulose .
And this is a static culture .
It doesn &apos;t need light .
At this point , it &apos;s really heavy .
So I spread it out onto a wooden sheet .
Using fruit and vegetable staining , create organic patterning .
And using indigo , make it anti-microbial .
What I can &apos;t yet do is make it water-resistant .
Align it in this direction .
Make it hydrophobic .
What excites me about using microbes is their efficiency .
So we only grow what we need .
There &apos;s no waste .
Thank you very much .
This is one of the jackets you grew ?
SL : Yes , it is .
Suzanne Lee .
Jon Nguyen : Tour the solar system from home
I would watch Nova on PBS .
Our school would show Bill Nye the Science Guy .
So what you &apos;re looking at right now is the Earth .
Google Earth goes from this view down to your backyard .
We go from this view out to the stars .
These are a number of our science space Earth orbiters .
All right , so what about the rest of it ?
It &apos;s actually pretty busy .
Here we have Juno on its cruise to Jupiter , there .
You can see how it &apos;s tilted at about 89 degrees .
So now we &apos;ve gone back in time .
We &apos;re now riding along with Voyager 1 .
The date here is November 11 , 1980 .
Now , there &apos;s a funny thing going on here .
It doesn &apos;t look like anything &apos;s going on .
It looks like I &apos;ve paused the program .
It actually has a very thick atmosphere .
There &apos;s a point to be made here .
There &apos;s a whole story to tell here .
If you want to pause it , you can pause it .
It actually flies underneath Saturn .
You can manipulate it yourself .
You can fly around yourself and you can learn for yourself .
Thank you .
Quixotic Fusion : Dancing with light
Andreas Raptopoulos : No roads ? There &apos;s a drone for that
One billion people .
Could we do the same for transportation ?
Imagine this scenario .
What would you do today ?
That &apos;s the part that works .
That &apos;s the part that &apos;s broken .
It &apos;s an ultra-flexible , automated logistics network .
It &apos;s a network for a transportation of matter .
We call it Matternet .
We use three key technologies .
The first is electric autonomous flying vehicles .
First of all , the UAVs .
Today , we &apos;re using small quads .
These fly autonomously .
This is the key to the technology .
The ground stations are located on safe locations on the ground .
People there love this .
So this is a $ 3,000 vehicle .
Costs are coming down very rapidly .
The next big question is , what &apos;s the cost ?
Compare this to normal infrastructure investments .
It can be used perhaps in other places in the world .
Half of the Earth &apos;s population lives in cities today .
Half a billion of us live in megacities .
We are living through an amazing urbanization trend .
Congestion is a huge problem .
So why are we doing this ?
Thank you .
Rives : Reinventing the encyclopedia game
So I tried .
You can start anywhere , this time I chose Earth .
And the first rule of the game is pretty simple .
And it is really fun to say .
You can use it at TED .
Chimborazo , right ?
I didn &apos;t know that ; that &apos;s pretty cool .
Chimborazo !
So the next rule of the game is also pretty simple .
You just have to find another term and look that up .
Nowadays there are hundreds of links to choose from .
They move ; they go up , they go down .
I didn &apos;t know it .
Chimborazo !
Famous for its diversity , human diversity .
This is the most successful order on the planet by far .
Statistically , one of you is a beetle .
And if it is you , you are astonishingly well adapted .
Fireflies are not flies , fireflies are beetles .
Like my next link : The chemical language of pheromones .
Yeah .
And the link to aphrodisiac .
Now that &apos;s something that increases sexual desire , possibly chocolate .
But not when they &apos;re together like that .
I do like sympathy . I do like magic .
This is the boy in me getting lucky again .
Sympathetic magic is imitation .
We &apos;ve got tens-of-thousands-years-old artwork .
He doesn &apos;t .
He lives in rainforests and savannas .
Germans occupied Russia .
You can come back to Earth .
You return to where you started .
You can finish your game .
I found it myself .
It &apos;s got some math that I can do .
I &apos;m pretty sure my dad doesn &apos;t know it .
That &apos;s pretty cool .
I didn &apos;t know that .
Chimborazo !
Thank you .
Fiorenzo Omenetto : Silk , the ancient material of the future
Thank you .
I &apos;m thrilled to be here .
So that &apos;s kind of a bold statement .
I &apos;ll tell you a little bit more .
It actually gets reintegrated in the body .
And the material looks something like this .
In fact , this material you see is clear and transparent .
The components of this material are just water and protein .
So this material is silk .
The process of discovery , generally , is inspired by nature .
And so we get this starting material .
And we take advantage of something that is very simple .
They find their way to self-assemble .
But I mentioned that the film is also technological .
And so what does that mean ?
So let me see .
It &apos;s actually not limited to films .
And so the material can assume a lot of formats .
You can add a third dimensionality to the film .
But you can do other things .
But silk is versatile and it goes beyond optics .
And you can think of different formats .
You can do bigger things .
And the gears work in water as well .
So you think of alternative mechanical parts .
You can do electronic pieces that fold and wrap .
Or if you &apos;re fashion forward , some silk LED tattoos .
But there are still some unique traits .
And you see here a picture of a tissue section .
And you see there , it gets reintegrated in tissue .
So it makes the materials environmentally active and interactive .
So we &apos;ve made a silk card with penicillin in it .
And so what you see there is the difference .
Thank you .
Sandra Aamodt : Why dieting doesn &apos;t usually work
I &apos;m sure many of you know the feeling .
That &apos;s what a thermostat does , right ?
That &apos;s a lot of food .
Successful dieting doesn &apos;t lower your set point .
Sadly , a temporary weight gain can become permanent .
Let &apos;s call them intuitive eaters and controlled eaters .
So don &apos;t do that .
Now let &apos;s look at what happens in overweight people .
But a healthy lifestyle helps obese people too .
Diets don &apos;t have very much reliability .
Forty percent of them have gained even more .
And my answer , in a word , is mindfulness .
How do you do it ?
Sit down to regular meals without distractions .
I often don &apos;t think about it .
I forget we have chocolate in the house .
It &apos;s like aliens have taken over my brain .
It &apos;s just completely different .
Let me leave you with one last thought .
Thanks .
Lee Cronin : Print your own medicine
In essence , could we &quot; app &quot; chemistry ?
Now what could this mean ?
So how are we doing this in the lab ?
So what could this mean ?
You don &apos;t need to go to the chemist anymore .
We can print drugs at point of need .
We can download new diagnostics .
Say a new super bug has emerged .
So this allows you on-the-fly molecular assembly .
Beam me up , Scotty .
Eli Pariser : Beware online &quot; filter bubbles &quot;
It meant a connection to the world .
It meant something that would connect us all together .
They disappeared .
Google &apos;s doing it too .
So here &apos;s my friend Scott &apos;s screen shot .
And here &apos;s my friend Daniel &apos;s screen shot .
Scott &apos;s results were full of them .
That &apos;s how different these results are becoming .
So it &apos;s not just Google and Facebook either .
This is something that &apos;s sweeping the Web .
So I do think this is a problem .
They enter the queue , they just zip right out .
So the best editing gives us a bit of both .
But that &apos;s not actually what &apos;s happening right now .
Then people noticed that they were doing something really important .
We need it to connect us all together .
Thank you .
Alan Russell : The potential of regenerative medicine
There are words that we &apos;re truly afraid of .
It was basically a regenerative medicine issue .
Regenerative medicine is an extraordinarily simple concept that everybody can understand .
This is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine .
This is not regenerative medicine .
And this is just the same .
We &apos;ve come a long way since then .
Why is this important ?
And why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now ?
Just have a look at the demographics in the U.S. here .
This is from &quot; The Untied States of America . &quot;
In 1930 , there were 41 workers per retiree .
In 2010 , two workers per retiree in the U.S.
This is age versus cost of health care .
All those things do is change who pays .
You can prevent .
Obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention .
Think of it in terms of diabetes , for instance .
Today , with diabetes , what do we do ?
And we do OK . Insulin &apos;s a pretty good therapy .
This is a newt re-growing its limb .
It &apos;s a wild concept .
But it &apos;s applicable , again , to every organ system .
How can we do that ?
We need to learn to speak the body &apos;s language .
The first is cellular therapies .
Secondly , we can use materials .
We heard yesterday about the importance of new materials .
And he asked a very important question .
What I &apos;m about to show you is a diabetic ulcer .
This is the reality of diabetes .
This is a diabetic ulcer . It &apos;s tragic .
The treatment for this is amputation .
That &apos;s what the wound looked like 11 weeks later .
That material contained only natural signals .
This is a horse . The horse is not in pain .
Here &apos;s a dolphin where the fin &apos;s been re-attached .
Could you regenerate a limb ?
And I &apos;ll show you the 15 million dollar picture .
Remember that I mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips .
After treatment that &apos;s what it looks like .
This is happening today .
This is clinically relevant today .
But could you go a little further ?
This was done by Teruo Okano at Tokyo Women &apos;s Hospital .
He can actually grow beating tissue in a dish .
It &apos;s the coolest stuff .
Now I &apos;m going to show you cell-based regeneration .
But this one &apos;s kind of cool .
You see the cells coming back out .
This was a randomized trial .
These are now two years out .
There go the cells .
It &apos;s a great source of stem cells .
Stem cells are packed in that liposuction fluid .
So you could go in , you could get your tummy-tuck .
All done in the lab .
Here &apos;s just one example before I close up .
This is equally tragic .
Many of those patients are very severely burned .
And that bio-reactor will lay down in the wound bed .
The gun that you see there sprays cells .
That &apos;s going to spray cells over that area .
It &apos;s a completely different way of doing it .
So my 18 minutes is up .
The good news is that this is happening today .
It &apos;s very powerful work .
Clearly the images kind of get that across .
It &apos;s incredibly difficult because it &apos;s highly inter-disciplinary .
It &apos;s no coincidence .
They need this to work or their health system dies .
The European Union , same thing .
China , the same thing .
China just launched a national tissue-engineering center .
The first year budget was 250 million US dollars .
In the United States we &apos;ve had a somewhat different approach .
We &apos;ve had a different approach .
Thank you .
Terry Moore : Why is &apos; x &apos; the unknown ?
Where &apos;d that come from ?
This includes the little system in Arabic called al-jebra .
Al-jebr finally came into English as algebra .
One example among many .
But there were problems .
Trust me on that one .
Here &apos;s one of the culprits .
So this is al-shalan -- the unknown thing .
But now we have the answer to our question .
Why is it that X is the unknown ?
And I thought that was worth sharing .
Mike Biddle : We can recycle plastic
I &apos;m a garbage man .
And I &apos;d like to start at the very beginning .
Think back when you were just a kid .
How did look at the stuff in your life ?
The entire pile is my stuff if I &apos;m building something .
The more stuff that &apos;s mine , the better .
And let me tell you why I have that perspective .
We see above-ground mines .
In fact , it &apos;s more like five percent .
Most of it &apos;s incinerated or landfilled .
But actually , plastics are several times more valuable than steel .
They have very different densities .
They have different electrical and magnetic properties .
And they even have different colors .
Plastics have overlapping densities over a very narrow range .
They have either identical or very similar electrical and magnetic properties .
And they extract the metals by hand .
I call this environmental arbitrage .
This is just one example .
They store the plastics on the roofs .
Because after all , we &apos;re doing above-ground mining .
And we eventually broke the code .
This is the last frontier of recycling .
And we finally figured out how to do it .
The traditional way to make plastics is with oil or petrochemicals .
Well a good place to start is with waste .
We have significantly lower capital costs in our plant equipment .
We have enormous energy savings .
Our customers get to enjoy huge CO2 savings .
They get to close the loop with their products .
And they get to make more sustainable products .
Even an occasional dead animal , unfortunately .
It looks like the Willy Wonka factory at this point .
We then use optical sorting to color sort this material .
We blend it in 50,000-lb. blending silos .
And we chop those strands into what are called pellets .
And this becomes the currency of the plastics industry .
This is the same material that you would get from oil .
We took our clues from mother nature .
Mother nature wastes very little , reuses practically everything .
Thank you for your time .
Lalitesh Katragadda : Making maps to fight disaster , build economies
In 2008 , Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmar .
Millions of people were in severe need of help .
The U.N. wanted to rush people and supplies to the area .
But help was coming .
And it took them four days .
The new software they used ? Google Mapmaker .
Maps matter .
Welcome to the new world .
Nathan Myhrvold : Cooking as never seen before
I &apos;ve been interested in food for a long time .
I went to chef school in France .
And it &apos;s largely what you would find in these books .
And it &apos;s a wonderful thing .
But that &apos;s not in any of those books .
There &apos;s a chef in Spain named Ferran Adria .
He &apos;s developed a very avant-garde cuisine .
None of them are taught in cooking schools .
This is a picture called a cutaway .
This is actually the first picture I took in the book .
And the hope was two-fold .
Steaming ought to be faster .
So here &apos;s another one .
We discovered why woks are the shape they are .
And one of our canning cutaways .
Here &apos;s our hamburger cutaway .
Of course , you &apos;re not actually working the whole time .
Most of the time is kind of sitting there .
Buying mesquite charcoal will not actually make that much difference .
Mostly it comes from fat pyrolyzing , or burning .
Now you might wonder , how do we make these cutaways ?
Most people assume we use Photoshop .
We cut a $ 5,000 restaurant oven in half .
We used a red , very high-temperature silicon to do that .
In most cases , though , there was no glass .
Like for the hamburger , we just cut the damn barbecue .
The wok shot caught fire three times .
One of our cooks lost his eyebrows that way .
But hey , they grow back .
In addition to cutaways , we also explain physics .
This is Fourier &apos;s law of heat conduction .
It &apos;s a partial differential equation .
We &apos;ve got lots of little tidbits in the book .
Everybody knows that your various appliances have wattage , right ?
But you probably don &apos;t know that much about James Watt .
We also did a lot of calculation .
As you move side to side , it moves off .
That horn-shaped region is what we call the sweet spot .
So that &apos;s the place where you really want to cook .
Here &apos;s a step-by-step that shows grinding hamburger .
And it &apos;s really simple , as you can see here .
Here &apos;s the final hamburger .
This is the 30-hour hamburger .
We make every aspect of this burger .
The lettuce has got liquid smoke infused into it .
We also have things about how to make the bun .
The popcorn is illustrating a key thing in physics .
Isn &apos;t that beautiful ?
That &apos;s what &apos;s happening to the water inside that popcorn .
So it &apos;s a great illustration of that .
We have a chapter on gels .
Anyway , here &apos;s the book .
Here it is .
2,438 pages .
And they &apos;re nice big pages too .
Brian Greene : Is our universe the only universe ?
Now the idea of a multiverse is a strange one .
Now this was revolutionary .
What &apos;s pushing on it ?
And this explanation represents great progress .
But I promised you a mystery here in part one .
Here it is .
This number is small .
Expressed in the relevant unit , it is spectacularly small .
And the mystery is to explain this peculiar number .
Now you might wonder , should you care ?
First off , what is it ?
And the central idea of string theory is quite straightforward .
And in string theory , vibration determines everything .
So , what to do ?
Here &apos;s the idea .
Which means we have been asking the wrong question .
And that &apos;s a question on which we can make headway .
And that would be that .
Mystery solved , multiverse found .
Now some find this explanation unsatisfying .
Kepler was asking the wrong question .
And again , that &apos;s a question we can answer .
And that takes me to my final part , part three .
But there &apos;s a little secret .
The Big Bang leaves out something pretty important , the Bang .
Each of these universes has extra dimensions .
The extra dimensions take on a wide variety of different shapes .
The different shapes yield different physical features .
Well let me describe one way that might one day happen .
The inflationary theory already has strong observational support .
But would those future astronomers believe such ancient knowledge ?
I suspect the latter .
It appears that it may not always be that way .
and the message echoing across the ages is clear .
Thank you very much .
Brian , thank you .
Well it &apos;s hard to say .
Holy cow ! That &apos;s just amazing .
You &apos;re going to be around for the next few days .
Maybe some of these conversations can continue .
Thank you . Thank you , Brian .
Michael Tilson Thomas : Music and emotion through time
Yet , he was my greatest teacher .
But he was tough when it came to music .
That was his passion for the music .
Both my parents really loved it .
Brah dada dadadadah . &quot;
And he ran around the bases .
And I thought , go figure .
It &apos;s a language that &apos;s still evolving .
It &apos;s so simple , so evocative .
So many emotions seem to be inside of it .
It &apos;s just a design of pitches and silence and time .
They &apos;re locations in the spectrum of sound .
And in the 17th century , it was more like this .
And in the 21st century ...
Mozart was the same way .
This was truly the music of the spheres .
Singer : Ah , bitter blow !
Ah , wicked , cruel fate !
Ah , baleful stars !
Ah , avaricious heaven !
But what &apos;s the actual difference between these two chords ?
It &apos;s just these two notes in the middle .
So the big difference between human happiness and sadness ?
37 freakin &apos; vibrations .
Now with all this possibility , classical music really took off .
Now this moment so fascinates me .
I find it such a profound one .
What happens when the music stops ?
Where does it go ? What &apos;s left ?
And how might that change their lives ?
To me this is the intimate , personal side of music .
And to me that &apos;s the most essential of all .
And technology democratized music by making everything available .
Nobody knows .
The question remains : What happens when the music stops ?
What sticks with people ?
And the exciting thing is all this is just a prototype .
We need your perspectives , your curiosity , your voices .
You don &apos;t need to worry about knowing anything .
You can start anywhere . Ramble a bit .
Follow traces . Get lost . Be surprised , amused inspired .
Thank you .
Boghuma Kabisen Titanji : Ethical riddles in HIV research
Maybe this particular trial yielded exciting results .
Maybe it even got published in a high-profile scientific journal .
The first of these is informed consent .
Thank you .
Jared Diamond : How societies can grow old better
I &apos;m going to talk about growing older in traditional societies .
In which tribal societies do children abandon or kill their parents ?
It happens mainly under two conditions .
They face a cruel situation of no choice .
In those societies , older people are cared for .
They are fed . They remain valuable .
Older Americans are at a big disadvantage in job applications .
They &apos;re at a big disadvantage in hospitals .
We Americans move on the average every five years .
That &apos;s a huge problem .
They &apos;ve already gained experience from raising their own children .
Unfortunately , all of those terrible situations could come back .
Older people have that experience .
Younger people don &apos;t .
Some abilities , of course , decrease with age .
They think more realistically about dangers than we do .
Thank you .
Jae Rhim Lee : My mushroom burial suit
And it &apos;s everywhere .
But it &apos;s just one chemical .
The Center for Disease Control in the U.S.
To me , this says three things .
First , don &apos;t become a cannibal .
So what happens to all these toxins when we die ?
But our current funeral practices make the situation much worse .
I think there &apos;s a better solution .
Just a little .
And now about these ninja pajamas .
I &apos;m wearing the second prototype of this burial suit .
I believe this is the beginning of true environmental responsibility .
Thank you .
Jonathan Klein : Photos that changed the world
Okay , we &apos;re naive , we &apos;re bright-eyed and bushy-tailed .
So let &apos;s begin with a group of images .
But I think we &apos;re looking for something more .
We &apos;re looking for something more .
Well , this image you &apos;ve all seen .
It changed our view of the physical world .
We had never seen our planet from this perspective before .
This destructive power takes many different forms .
There &apos;s another kind of crucifixion .
Let &apos;s go back a little .
In fact , these images became the voices of protest themselves .
Did the images change the world ?
No , but they had a major impact .
John Moore set up this photo at Arlington Cemetery .
My company has 70 million images .
I have one image in my office .
Here it is .
And thank you to all the photographers .
John Hunter : Teaching with the World Peace Game
I &apos;m very fortunate to be here .
I feel so fortunate .
I &apos;ve been so impressed by the kindness expressed to me .
It &apos;s a true feeling .
And she &apos;s a very high-tech superintendent .
She &apos;s a technology leader and instructional leader .
Why is this old table in your office ? &quot;
It all started back in 1977 .
It was an experimental education program .
Gifted education hadn &apos;t really taken hold too much .
There weren &apos;t really many materials or things to use .
And I said , &quot; What do I do ? &quot;
And her answer shocked me . It stunned me .
She said , &quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And that question cleared the space .
His name is Chris Farina .
Chris Farina is here today at his own cost .
But the film has really gone places .
And it &apos;s a beautiful thing .
What I saw was my teachers coming through me .
That &apos;s the smile I use -- that &apos;s his smile .
I saw Jan Polo &apos;s flashing eyes .
And I have that kind of flash sometimes .
And you know , she had that old-school teacher stare .
You know the one .
You know that teacher ?
And Miss Banks was there as a great mentor for me .
And then I saw my own parents , my first teachers .
My father , very inventive , spatial thinker .
That &apos;s my brother Malcolm there on the right .
I am one of her teaching gestures .
It &apos;s an amazing feeling to have that lineage .
I &apos;m not here alone .
There are many people on this stage right now .
I was creating a lesson for students on Africa .
I didn &apos;t want to lecture or have just book reading .
So I thought , well they like to play games .
And it has four Plexiglass layers .
There are four countries around the board .
They have different assets , commercial and military .
And each country has a cabinet .
I choose the Prime Minister based on my relationship with them .
That &apos;s not all .
So that , if one thing changes , everything else changes .
And they &apos;ve done it several times too .
But they &apos;re also trying to undermine everything in the game .
I &apos;m just a clock watcher .
I &apos;m just a clarifier . I &apos;m just a facilitator .
The students run the game .
So I &apos;ll just share with you ...
Boy : The World Peace Game is serious .
And so I apologize to them as well .
Now you may be wondering what all this complexity looks like .
It &apos;s a serious question : who is really in charge ?
To her girlfriends she said that .
That &apos;s a breach there .
They are the toughest opponents .
And we were very upset .
I could not have designed that in teaching it .
It came about spontaneously through their collective wisdom .
Another example , a beautiful thing happened .
We have a letter in the game .
&quot; Let &apos;s ask that mom to read the letter .
It &apos;ll be more realer if she reads it . &quot;
She read two sentences .
By the third sentence , she was in tears .
I was in tears .
We all lose .
And it was an amazing occurrence and an amazing understanding .
I &apos;ll show you what my friend David says about this .
He &apos;s been in many battles .
David : We &apos;ve really had enough of people attacking .
JH : I get chills every time I see that .
That &apos;s the kind of engagement you want to have happen .
But it &apos;s self-evident assessment .
We know that &apos;s an authentic assessment of learning .
So I &apos;ll just share a third story .
This is about my friend Brennan .
Some are poor , some are wealthy . There are billions .
The World Bank president was a third-grader one time .
So the team that was the poorest had gotten even poorer .
There was no way they could win .
I thought , I &apos;m failing as a teacher .
I should have gotten it so they could have won .
They shouldn &apos;t be failing like this .
I &apos;ve failed them .
And I was just feeling so sad and dejected .
They get these dossiers full of secret documents .
They were gesticulating ; they were running around .
Principal walks in , I &apos;m out of a job .
The parents were looking in the window .
And we &apos;ve got 600 billion dollars .
Will you accept it ? &quot;
And there are three seconds left on the clock .
And the game is won .
Every game we play is different .
Some games are more about warfare .
If only .
Nic Marks : The Happy Planet Index
He said , &quot; I have a dream . &quot;
And I have a dream .
We have focused on the worst-case scenario .
We have focused on the problems .
And we have not thought enough about the solutions .
People are freezing and running away because we &apos;re using fear .
What would it be like to be improving the human lot ?
Come on . In the Western world , we have enough .
This is from a global survey .
It &apos;s asking people , what do they want .
Okay , they think money is slightly important .
We all need to love and be loved in life .
It &apos;s not nearly as important as health .
We want to be healthy and live a full life .
These seem to be natural human aspirations .
Why are statisticians not measuring these ?
That should be the goal of every nation on the planet .
And economics is very interested in scarcity .
It is an efficiency measure .
More is bad .
It &apos;s about the well-being of nations .
It &apos;s like a happiness adjusted life-expectancy .
It &apos;s like quality and quantity of life in nations .
In Hobbesian terms , life is short and brutish there .
But now for the good news !
This is an aspirational graph .
They &apos;re Latin American .
Maybe some of you have .
Costa Rica .
Costa Rica -- average life expectancy is 78-and-a-half years .
That is longer than in the USA .
They are the happiest place .
What &apos;s going on there ?
What &apos;s happening in Costa Rica ?
We can look at some of the data .
99 percent of their electricity comes from renewable resources .
They abolished the army in 1949 -- 1949 .
And they invested in social programs -- health and education .
And they have that Latin vibe , don &apos;t they .
They have the social connectedness .
It might be Latin American .
That &apos;s what we need to do .
And then we &apos;re starting to create a happy planet .
That &apos;s one way of looking at it .
Another way of looking at it is looking at time trends .
It &apos;s actually not very long away .
It &apos;s half a human lifetime away .
A child entering school today will be my age in 2050 .
This is not the very distant future .
That is changing our business .
I think we want it to carry on .
They want to hold on to what they &apos;ve got .
And that means we have to really increase efficiency even more .
Human beings are very motivated by the &quot; now . &quot;
What would that look like for society ?
And why do I hear that ?
That &apos;s how you create a collective goal .
At a personal level , we need these nudges too .
What are these for happiness ?
Keep building them .
The second one is be active .
Being active is great for our positive mood .
The third one is take notice .
It &apos;s more curiosity .
Keep learning .
We feel good if we give .
They don &apos;t have any carbon content .
Human beings want to be happy .
Pave them with the five ways .
Shirin Neshat : Art in exile
Well , it has its pluses and minuses .
Politics have defined our lives .
We are there to take pride and insist on respect .
And at the same time , we &apos;re fighting another battle .
Our artists are at risk .
We are in a position of danger .
We pose a threat to the order of the government .
Art is our weapon .
Culture is a form of resistance .
I did not start to make social commentary about my country .
It was after the Islamic Revolution of 1979 .
For me , this became incredibly important .
And yet , I had an unusual position toward this .
So my art became slightly more critical .
My knife became a little sharper .
And I fell into a life in exile .
I am a nomadic artist .
I work in Morocco , in Turkey , in Mexico .
I go everywhere to make believe it &apos;s Iran .
Now I am making films .
The book is written by an Iranian woman , Shahrnush Parsipur .
It &apos;s a magical realist novel .
These are some of the shots actually from my film .
These are some of the images of the coup .
The challenge I have is how to do that .
How to tell a political story but an allegorical story .
The green movement significantly inspired the world .
They &apos;re absolutely inspirational for me .
That , under all circumstances , they have pushed the boundary .
They have confronted the authority .
And once again , they proved themselves .
Thank you so much .
Beau Lotto : Optical illusions show how we see
I want to start with a game .
So , we have two panels here , of colored dots .
And you have to tell me which one .
Really ? Okay .
How many people think it &apos;s the green one ?
And how many people think it &apos;s the orange one ?
Pretty even split .
Let &apos;s find out what the reality is .
Here is the orange one .
Here is the green one .
And here is the gray one .
And instead of telling you , I &apos;ll just show you .
Can anyone see it ? Anyone ? No ?
And now you see it .
And these are two projections from the world .
They are identical in every single way .
Identical in shape , size , spectral content .
And yet they come from completely different sources .
And yet it &apos;s only the retinal information that we get .
So how on Earth do we even see ?
There is no inherent meaning in information .
It &apos;s what we do with that information that matters .
Audience : &quot; Can you read this ? &quot;
&quot; You are not reading this . &quot;
&quot; What are you reading ? &quot;
But you put one there . Why ?
So you don &apos;t do it again .
So , if I could have the lights down up here .
One is simply the flipping of the other . Okay ?
But I really want you to learn .
That &apos;s what it &apos;s learning . Okay ?
So why don &apos;t you do that now ?
Can I have the lights up again ?
That &apos;s your new normal .
So , what does this mean for context ?
And the same thing over on the right .
And see what happens to your perception .
So you see it that way .
So you see it that way .
This is one I made a few years ago .
The four blue tiles on the left are gray .
The seven yellow tiles on the right are also gray .
They are the same . Okay ?
Don &apos;t believe me ? Let &apos;s watch it again .
Now I want you to keep looking at it .
Move your eyes around , blink , maybe close one eye .
Yes ? Raise your hand if you got that . Yes ?
So I can ask you , which direction is it rotating ?
How do you know ?
Your brain doesn &apos;t know . Because both are equally likely .
Are we the only ones that see illusions ?
The answer to this question is no .
So in my lab , we of course work on bumblebees .
And we do this in what we call the Bee Matrix .
And you &apos;ll see one of the bees come out here .
You see how she has a little number on her ?
Now , they are not born that way . Right ?
And then you can superglue little numbers on them .
And here she comes down the ladder .
But what are these bees doing in the upper right corner ?
It looks like they &apos;re going to green flowers .
Now , are they getting it wrong ?
But those are blue flowers under green light .
Okay , this is complete rubbish .
And how we see is by continually redefining normality .
And they can navigate the world using their ears .
On the left is what his camera sees .
That line is broken up into 32 squares .
In each square we calculate the average color .
And then we just simply translate that into sound .
He finds it . Amazing . Right ?
And then we translated these images .
And this is one of those images .
And this is what it sounds like .
So , a six-year-old child . Okay ?
Now , what does all this mean ?
And that ecology is necessarily relative , historical and empirical .
Because I think only through uncertainty is there potential for understanding .
So , if we have the lights down .
I &apos;m going to do this opposite on the left here .
Agreed ? Yes ?
Okay . So they are physically the same .
Let &apos;s pull the covers off .
Do they look the same ? No .
The question is , &quot; Is that an illusion ? &quot;
And I &apos;ll leave you with that .
So , thank you very much .
David Pogue : The music wars
A TED medley -- a TEDley .
Martin Seligman : The new era of positive psychology
And she said , &quot; Well , one . &quot;
&quot; Good . &quot;
&quot; Cut . Cut . That won &apos;t do .
We &apos;d really better give you a longer sound bite . &quot;
Doctor Seligman , what is the state of psychology today ? &quot;
&quot; Not good . &quot;
We &apos;d better give you a real sound bite .
This time you can have three words .
Professor Seligman , what is the state of psychology today ? &quot;
So , why was psychology good ?
That we could create a classification of the mental illnesses .
That we could understand the causality of the mental illnesses .
And we forgot that people made choices and decisions .
We forgot responsibility . That was the first cost .
The second cost was that we forgot about you people .
We forgot about improving normal lives .
No one works on that .
So that was not good .
It should be interested in the best things in life .
It turns out that we can measure different forms of happiness .
And how do they differ from the rest of us ?
And it turns out there &apos;s one way .
They don &apos;t sit in seminars on Saturday morning .
They don &apos;t spend time alone .
About 120 interventions have been proposed that allegedly make people happy .
That is , which ones actually make people lastingly happier ?
The first happy life is the pleasant life .
That &apos;s what Aristotle was talking about .
And third , the meaningful life .
And , as I said , it &apos;s not particularly malleable .
And this leads to the second life .
Len is an introvert .
But it turned out there wasn &apos;t any sexual trauma .
You &apos;re one with the music . Time stops .
You have intense concentration .
Hated the job .
She &apos;s working her way through college .
Now obviously she failed .
What you get out of that is not smiley-ness .
You don &apos;t look like Debbie Reynolds .
The second path is eudaimonian flow .
And the third path is meaning .
This is the most venerable of the happinesses , traditionally .
It &apos;s being done in a rigorous manner .
Close your eyes .
The person has to be alive . OK .
Now , OK , you can open your eyes .
I hope all of you have such a person .
And fun versus philanthropy .
So those are examples of positive interventions .
The pursuit of meaning is the strongest .
The pursuit of engagement is also very strong .
But they were empty .
AnnMarie Thomas : Hands-on science with squishy circuits
I &apos;m a huge believer in hands-on education .
But you have to have the right tools .
And so we spent a summer looking at different Play-Doh recipes .
You see that really salty Play-Doh ?
Well , it conducts electricity .
And this is nothing new .
And that sugar dough ?
So what does that mean ?
And so I want to do a little demo for you .
If I push these together , the light turns off .
If I separate them again , I have some light .
It &apos;s like a wall to the electricity .
I plug in again the power to it .
And now I can start talking about parallel and series circuits .
I can start plugging in lots of lights .
And we can start talking about things like electrical load .
It &apos;ll dim .
You could do parallel and series circuits for kids using this .
So this is all in your home kitchen .
We &apos;ve got some videos . You can make them yourselves .
Have fun . Thank you .
Billy Graham : On technology and faith
And I was so stimulated .
Richard can answer that , because he made that decision .
I was to address a conference at a hotel .
And the man said , &quot; No , who ? &quot;
He said , &quot; You don &apos;t say ! &quot;
He said , &quot; Your sermons have certainly helped me . &quot;
And I suppose that that &apos;s true with thousands of people .
We &apos;ve had others .
And there &apos;s one that I want to talk about .
He was a man of tremendous leadership .
He had the favor of God with him .
There were many problems still left .
The first one that David saw was human evil .
Where does it come from ?
How do we solve it ?
And yet he says , &quot; He restores my soul . &quot;
Have you ever thought about what a contradiction we are ?
But on the other hand , something is wrong .
Now , what causes this ?
And revolutions ?
But he made this statement .
The Oklahoma City bombing was simple technology , horribly used .
The problem is not technology .
The problem is the person or persons using it .
We are a soul .
What &apos;s life all about ? Why am I here ?
I went to Ambassador Dobrynin , whom I knew very well .
What shall I talk to her about ? &quot;
And he surprised me with the answer .
He said , &quot; Talk to her about religion and philosophy .
That &apos;s what she &apos;s really interested in . &quot;
I haven &apos;t given a talk in nearly four months .
I &apos;m not reading . I never read an address .
I never read a speech or a talk or a lecture .
I talk ad lib .
We have families that self-destruct , friends that betray us .
Unbearable psychological pressures bear down on us .
He said , &quot; The Lord is my shepherd . &quot;
Most people live as if they &apos;re never going to die .
Technology projects the myth of control over our mortality .
We see people on our screens .
They don &apos;t know that she &apos;s dead .
Or Clark Gable , or whoever it is .
The old stars , they come to life .
But death is inevitable .
And we were meeting in that room , the statue room .
About 300 of them were there .
I said , &quot; We &apos;re all going to die .
And it &apos;s often difficult for young people to understand that .
I &apos;ve talked to them .
Was there a God ?
It passes so fast . &quot;
But it does not need to have to be that way .
On the contrary , they &apos;re sisters . &quot;
He put it on a personal basis .
I knew Dr. von Braun very well .
And I said , &quot; Sir , I do . &quot;
He said , &quot; So do I. &quot;
Blaise Pascal asked exactly that question in seventeenth-century France .
Pascal has been called the architect of modern civilization .
Pascal saw us as a remarkable mixture of genius and self-delusion .
Equally well known is Pascal &apos;s Wager .
For Pascal , scientific knowledge paled beside the knowledge of God .
I didn &apos;t make good grades in high school .
One day , I was faced face-to-face with Christ .
Can you imagine that ? &quot; I am the truth .
I &apos;m the embodiment of all truth . &quot;
He was a liar .
Or he was insane .
Or he was what he claimed to be .
Which was he ?
I had to make that decision .
I couldn &apos;t prove it .
Thank you , and God bless all of you .
Thank you for the privilege . It was great .
Richard Wurman : You did it .
Thanks .
Patricia Ryan : Don &apos;t insist on English !
I know what you &apos;re thinking .
I get that all the time in Dubai .
&quot; Here on holiday are you , dear ? &quot;
&quot; Come to visit the children ?
How long are you staying ? &quot;
Well actually , I hope for a while longer yet .
Now that statistic is quite shocking .
How did those students get all that knowledge ?
Of course , from their grandparents and even their great-grandparents .
A language dies every 14 days .
Could there be a connection ?
Well I don &apos;t know .
Actually , not that long ago .
That is a little bit too early .
Okay .
And why not ?
So everybody wants to have an English education , naturally .
Perhaps you have a computer scientist who &apos;s a genius .
Well , I don &apos;t think so .
We English teachers reject them all the time .
I don &apos;t think so .
But indeed , that is exactly what we do .
We English teachers are the gatekeepers .
Maybe the barrier would be too universal .
Okay .
It &apos;s all in English . &quot;
It feeds the English requirement .
And so it goes on .
I ask you , what happened to translation ?
And so light shone upon the Dark Ages of Europe .
I love it that we have a global language .
We need one today more than ever .
But I am against using it as a barrier .
Case in point , Einstein .
Now it &apos;s exploded .
There are lots and lots of tests of English .
And millions and millions of students take these tests every year .
So immediately , we &apos;re rejecting them .
They want to give their children the best chance in life .
And to do that , they need a Western education .
It &apos;s a circular thing .
Okay .
But they couldn &apos;t get the results they wanted .
So bingo , problem solved .
If you can &apos;t think a thought , you are stuck .
My daughter came to England from Kuwait .
She had studied science and mathematics in Arabic .
It &apos;s an Arabic medium school .
She had to translate it into English at her grammar school .
And she was the best in the class at those subjects .
So he invented a cost-free solar lamp .
A simple idea , but it could have such far-reaching consequences .
Let us not keep them and ourselves in the dark .
Let us celebrate diversity .
Mind your language .
Use it to spread great ideas .
Thank you very much .
Alex Steffen : The shareable future of cities
That shouldn &apos;t be news to any of us .
We will be an overwhelmingly urban species .
And people are embracing this .
Some of it &apos;s transportation access .
This is Google Walking Maps .
Okay . I do too .
Buildings are becoming bundles of services .
So we light our buildings with daylight .
We cool them with breezes . We heat them with sunshine .
These things actually become cheaper to build than the alternatives .
This is one way to do it .
So we have visions like this .
We have visions like this . We have visions like this .
Water is energy intensive .
Thank you very much .
Angela Patton : A father-daughter dance ... in prison
My daddy , he calls me all the time . &quot;
&quot; I haven &apos;t heard from my dad in years . &quot;
The wisdom lives inside of them .
They were dressed to the nines .
They acted sweet .
They acted silly .
They really enjoyed each other &apos;s company .
It was a huge success .
And the girls decided to make it an annual event .
&quot; Why not ? &quot; the girls asked .
&quot; Because he &apos;s in jail , &quot; she bravely admitted .
&quot; And come in shackles ?
That &apos;s worse than not having him here at all . &quot;
We want every girl to experience the dance , right ? &quot;
Because that &apos;s what they called them .
So , 16 inmates and 18 girls were invited .
They hugged .
They shared a full catered meal of chicken and fish .
They laughed together .
It was beautiful .
Even the guards cried .
I have had my father in my life always .
He &apos;s even here today .
Dennis vanEngelsdorp : A plea for bees
Now , that &apos;s an awful lot of bees .
And most of those losses are because of things we know .
And this flu has wiped through the population of bees .
But we think this virus is pretty ubiquitous .
We think perhaps it &apos;s a combination of factors .
No formal education , but very knowledgeable .
And these migratory beekeepers are the last nomads of America .
And although I highly encourage you , all use honey .
And bees are very faithful .
And of course , they &apos;re made to carry this pollen .
However , honeybees are a minority .
We have identified over 400 species of bees in Pennsylvania .
We have bumblebees on the top .
They &apos;re like tiny little flies and they fly around .
Dennis vanEngelsdorp : Bee . Okay , thanks .
And bats are dying at an extraordinary rate .
White-nose syndrome has wiped out populations of bats .
And I think that there is an easy cure for NDD .
And that is , make meadows and not lawns .
And so we need to rethink this idea .
And I encourage you to look at that .
Danielle de Niese : A flirtatious aria
Eve Ensler : Embrace your inner girl
Namaste . Good morning .
I &apos;m very happy to be here in India .
And I want to call it the girl cell .
And it &apos;s in men as well as in women .
To be a boy really means not to be a girl .
To be a man means not to be a girl .
To be a woman means not to be a girl .
To be strong means not to be a girl .
To be a leader means not to be a girl .
For me , it was the turning point of my life .
His name is Dr. Denis Mukwege .
My mind was so shattered .
Because my crying somehow exposed his brutality to him .
I know that we have systematically annihilated the girl cell .
And I will tell you a very funny story .
I &apos;ve seen girls be treated like garbage cans .
The selling of girls is rampant across the planet .
Girls are trained to please .
I want to change the verb .
I want us all to change the verb .
And she was holding her baby .
And I asked her if she loved her baby .
It &apos;s my baby and it &apos;s full of love . &quot;
They kidnapped her , they put her in a car .
So , for years Agnes walked through the Rift valley .
She has literally become deputy mayor .
She &apos;s changed the rules .
The whole community has bought in to what she &apos;s doing .
And there was a young girl named Jaclyn .
And she knew that meant she would be cut .
She knew that meant she wouldn &apos;t go to school .
She knew that meant she wouldn &apos;t have a future .
She slept with the hyenas . She hid at night .
And when she got to the house she was greeted .
We will not cut you .
For me , that is the power of girls .
And that is the power of transformation .
And I want to do it for Sunitha .
This is called &quot; I &apos;m An Emotional Creature . &quot;
And it happened because I met a girl in Watts , L.A.
It &apos;s all bad . My brothers get everything . &quot;
I &apos;m an emotional creature ! &quot;
This is for her : I love being a girl .
I am an emotional creature .
I know when a storm is coming .
I can feel the invisible stirrings in the air .
I am an emotional creature .
I love that I do not take things lightly .
I am an emotional creature .
These feelings make me better .
I am an emotional creature .
There is a particular way of knowing .
It &apos;s like the older women somehow forgot .
I rejoice that it &apos;s still in my body .
Oh , I know when the coconut &apos;s about to fall .
I know we have pushed the Earth too far .
And you know what ? Sometimes it should .
I am an emotional creature .
You don &apos;t tell the Atlantic Ocean to behave .
I am an emotional creature .
I am your remaining memory .
I can take you back .
Nothing &apos;s been diluted .
Nothing &apos;s leaked out .
Can you say it with me ?
Thank you very much .
Rives : The 4 a.m. mystery
This is a recent comic strip from the Los Angeles Times .
The punch line ?
This is a recent cover of New York Magazine .
A time for inconveniences , mishaps , yearnings .
It is four in the morning . &quot;
They worked until four o &apos;clock in the morning .
And it made me suspicious .
Could it be there is something more going on here ?
I call this The Giacometti Code , a TED exclusive .
Results vary , of course . This is pretty typical .
But he didn &apos;t die on Dench &apos;s birthday .
Where was Wislawa Szymborska during all this ?
She has the world &apos;s most absolutely watertight alibi .
Coincidence ? No , it &apos;s creepy .
Coincidence to me has a much simpler metric .
Now do you need towels , laundry , maids ?
It is Christmas Day , 4 a.m.
There &apos;s a rumble in my stomach .
Marge Simpson : Homer , please .
Let me see if I got this straight , Matt .
Parse it cover to cover for whatever hidden references you want .
Would you believe about a dozen paragraphs ?
It had gotten a lot better since 4 a.m. &quot;
Well , how could it have ?
What happens to American presidents at 0400 on inauguration day ?
What happened to William Jefferson Clinton ?
We might not ever know .
It could get awkward , right ?
In generations .
George Dyson : The birth of the computer
This was a perfect introduction .
And it was a technology that was inevitable .
He said you needed addition and subtraction .
You could do the whole thing with addition .
And that &apos;s really the simplest computer .
That &apos;s where I grew up as a kid .
All these forces came together there , in Princeton .
Oppenheimer , who had built the bomb .
The machine was actually used mainly for doing bomb calculations .
These were the prototype geeks , the nerds .
They didn &apos;t fit in at the Institute .
You can read the text .
This is hackers getting in trouble for the first time .
These were not theoretical physicists .
And it really was . It was the original microprocessor .
All the computers now are copies of that machine .
The input and the output was by teletype tape at first .
This is a wire drive , using bicycle wheels .
Then they switched to a magnetic drum .
And this is the beginning of computer graphics .
This includes a large amount of human error .
What &apos;s code , what &apos;s hardware ?
He had to focus the memory -- seems OK .
&quot; No use , went home . &quot;
Burning lots of midnight oil .
&quot; Found trouble in code , I hope . &quot;
&quot; Code error , machine not guilty . &quot;
&quot; A short -- do not turn the machine on . &quot;
So they really were working under tough conditions .
The high speed was 16 kilocycles .
&quot; I have now duplicated both results .
This now is the third different output .
I know when I &apos;m licked . &quot;
&quot; We &apos;ve duplicated errors before . &quot;
&quot; Machine run , fine . Code isn &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; Only happens when the machine is running . &quot;
And sometimes things are okay .
Trying to start an artificial genetic system running in the computer .
Began -- his universe started March 3 , &apos; 53 .
He had a wonderful rapport .
Even errors were duplicated .
So he designed this universe , and ran it .
It was published in the literature .
This is some of the generations of his universe .
They have to have something .
You have a genotype and you have to have a phenotype .
And they did start to evolve .
And he went around the country after that .
And he saw that evolution itself was an intelligent process .
It just was another version of the same thing happening .
And could you do it again now ?
And it was his universe on punch cards .
And the question is , should we run them or not ?
You know , could we get them running ?
Do you want to let it loose on the Internet ?
And that &apos;s what &apos;s happening !
It &apos;s a world that Von Neumann himself envisioned .
And we owe a tremendous credit to that .
And that &apos;s the end .
Thank you very much .
Don Norman : 3 ways good design makes you happy
The new me is beauty .
Well , I didn &apos;t have that in mind , so ...
This is neat .
Thank you for setting up my display .
I mean , it &apos;s just wonderful .
And that &apos;s my new life .
The acid will ruin the gold plating .
Beneath it is a wonderful knife .
It &apos;s a Global cutting knife made in Japan .
It &apos;s a delight to use .
And so it &apos;s got everything , right ?
It &apos;s beautiful and it &apos;s functional .
And those are the three components .
Is that a good way to play ping-pong ?
No . But is it fun ?
Yeah ! Yeah .
Or look at Google .
So Google just took their logo and they spread it out .
Instead of saying , &quot; You got 73,000 results .
It &apos;s really simple and subtle .
And it &apos;s just clever .
So , OK .
It was third .
Oh well , different story .
Buy it anyway .
It &apos;s so much fun to drive . &quot;
It &apos;s round , it &apos;s neat .
The controls work wonderfully .
I &apos;m going to put a plank on the ground .
No problem .
Intense fear paralyzes you .
It actually affects the way the brain works .
And I couldn &apos;t force myself across that .
Now some people can -- circus workers , steel workers .
But it really changes the way you think .
She brought students in to solve problems .
Would you tie those two strings together ? &quot;
Still can &apos;t reach it .
And , basically , none of them could solve it .
Would you like the box of candy ? &quot;
And guess what -- they solved the problem .
That &apos;s what brainstorming is about , right ?
You &apos;ve got be anxious .
No big deal .
Biology -- we have co-adapted through biology to like bright colors .
So that &apos;s the visceral level .
It &apos;s all about the visceral experience .
Visceral is subconscious , you &apos;re unaware of it .
Behavioral is subconscious , you &apos;re unaware of it .
Almost everything we do is subconscious .
Most of what we do is subconscious .
That &apos;s why the Global knives are so neat .
Or the sensual feeling .
It &apos;s a Ronnefeldt tilting teapot .
The water then seeps over the tea .
Emotion is all about acting ; emotion is really about acting .
It &apos;s being safe in the world .
It &apos;s kind of neat . What a wonderful design .
It looks over what &apos;s going on .
Here &apos;s a great reflective product .
But that &apos;s reflective design as well .
But it &apos;s ugly .
This is a clear Don Norman watch .
So , it &apos;s pitting one against the other .
The other neat thing ...
And that &apos;s what &apos;s nice about emotion .
So that &apos;s the new me .
I &apos;m only saying positive things from now on .
Renny Gleeson : Our antisocial phone tricks
So we &apos;ve developed certain tactics and strategies to cover up .
This first one &apos;s called &quot; the lean . &quot;
&quot; The stretch . &quot;
to get that device just below the tabletop .
Or , this one , coming to us from India .
That is actually the device .
Look around you .
This one I love .
This is the sound of one hand clapping .
People aren &apos;t simply projecting identity , they &apos;re creating it .
Thank you .
And then I &apos;ll draw the connection between these two behaviors .
Many of you have probably already noticed that I &apos;m Chinese .
I grew up in the Midwest of the United States .
You understood exactly what I just said in English .
I wouldn &apos;t have been able to convey so little information .
Actually , no .
It is the only Germanic language that requires this .
You speak English , a futured language .
Now this is a fanciful theory .
But how would you actually go about testing such a theory ?
This is a pocket of futureless language speakers in Northern Europe .
What is the average difference here ?
Five percentage points of your GDP saved per year .
Let me show you how far you can do that .
The survey takes over a day .
What are the characteristics we can control for ?
Does this have cumulative effects ?
Can we push this data even further ?
Well , think about smoking , for example .
Smoking is in some deep sense negative savings .
It &apos;s current pleasure in exchange for future pain .
What we should expect then is the opposite effect .
And that &apos;s exactly what we find .
Thank you very much .
Ken Robinson : Bring on the learning revolution !
Well , it &apos;s been downloaded four million times .
... don &apos;t you feel ?
And I referenced that at the end of my last talk .
So , as I was saying ...
You see , he &apos;s right .
Well , I do .
They simply go through their lives getting on with it .
They get no great pleasure from what they do .
And it &apos;s not true of enough people .
it &apos;s still true of a minority of people .
I think there are many possible explanations for it .
You have to create the circumstances where they show themselves .
This has to be transformed into something else .
One of the real challenges is to innovate fundamentally in education .
We don &apos;t teach American history in Britain .
We suppress it . You know , this is our policy .
I love that .
Not rise to it , rise with it .
I love that word , &quot; disenthrall . &quot;
You know what it means ?
Now , doing this is easier said than done .
And the reason is that you take it for granted .
So let me ask you something you may take for granted .
How many of you here are over the age of 25 ?
Are there any people here under the age of 25 ?
Ask a room full of teenagers the same thing .
Teenagers do not wear wristwatches .
They see no reason to do this .
She doesn &apos;t see the point .
&quot; Like , how lame is that ? &quot;
&quot; It has multiple functions . &quot;
Let me give you a couple of examples .
And probably the pinnacle for education is getting you to college .
I think we are obsessed with getting people to college .
Certain sorts of college .
Maybe they go later , not right away .
And I said , &quot; What do you do ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; I &apos;m a fireman . &quot;
This one teacher didn &apos;t take it seriously .
This linearity thing is a problem .
When I arrived in L.A.
No , it doesn &apos;t .
It doesn &apos;t .
Kindergarten begins in kindergarten .
They &apos;re three .
&quot; You &apos;ve achieved nothing -- commit .
The other big issue is conformity .
This is something Jamie Oliver talked about the other day .
You know there are two models of quality assurance in catering .
One is fast food , where everything is standardized .
I think we have to recognize a couple of things here .
One is that human talent is tremendously diverse .
People have very different aptitudes .
In a way , it did not for me .
It just wouldn &apos;t work .
But it &apos;s not only about that .
It &apos;s about passion .
So I think we have to change metaphors .
And you cannot predict the outcome of human development .
There are many great models .
That &apos;s where children experience life .
And I wanted to just very quickly ...
And we should tread softly .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Elizabeth Murchison : Fighting a contagious cancer
So first of all , what is a Tasmanian devil ?
A marsupial is a mammal with a pouch like a kangaroo .
At the time , this was thought to be a one-off .
Animals , just like humans , sometimes get strange tumors .
She hadn &apos;t eaten for days .
Her guts were swimming with parasitic worms .
Her body was riddled with secondary tumors .
Of course , they died along with the mother .
They were too young to survive without their mother .
Natural selection is survival of the fittest .
That &apos;s why cancer is such a difficult disease to treat .
It evolves .
The next slide is going to be gruesome .
This is Jonas .
I took these back to the lab .
I extracted DNA from them .
We found that all of these cancers shared the same DNA .
Think about that for a minute .
But how can a cancer spread in a population ?
So this Tasmanian devil cancer is perhaps the ultimate cancer .
Well the answer is , it has .
This is Kimbo .
And if you &apos;re squeamish , please look away now .
We also believe this cancer might be very old .
This cancer is remarkable .
It &apos;s the oldest mammalian-derived life form that we know of .
It &apos;s a living relic of the distant past .
So we &apos;ve seen that this can happen in animals .
Could cancers be contagious between people ?
What this tells us , ethical issues aside , is that ...
However , under some circumstances , it can happen .
My personal aim is to defeat the Tasmanian devil cancer .
Thank you .
Derek Paravicini and Adam Ockelford : In the key of genius
Music must be the thing for Derek .
That was the great eureka moment .
Derek Paravicini : I taught myself to play .
DP : &quot; Molly Malone . &quot;
AO : It wasn &apos;t actually &quot; Cockles and Mussels . &quot;
This one is &quot; English Country Garden . &quot;
DP : &quot; English Country Garden . &quot;
AO : There you are .
I think that &apos;s just fantastic .
Basically it was just an exciting journey , really .
But Derek , your ear is so much more than that .
Well , forget the terminology , Derek . Fantastic .
Now then .
So for example using your thumb under with C major .
Etc .
DP : No .
DP : This .
AO : Derek , let &apos;s have a bow .
Well done .
DP : &quot; Flight of the Bumblebee &quot; on that note .
AO : Or another one ? How about in G minor ?
DP : G minor .
AO : Fantastic . Well done , Derek .
Fantastic chap .
The other wonderful thing about you is memory .
So just be thoughtful before you suggest something too outlandish .
But seriously , would anyone like to choose a piece ?
Would you like to hear me play ?
AO : Well done .
DP : &quot; Chopsticks . &quot;
He &apos;s sitting there .
DP : Let Derek play it .
AO : What did you do with it , Derek ?
DP : I got to improvise with it , Adam .
AO : This is Derek the musician .
Keep up with Derek .
So this is one of Derek &apos;s heroes .
It &apos;s the great Art Tatum -- DP : Art Tatum .
DP : &quot; Tiger Rag . &quot;
Bjorn Lomborg : Global priorities bigger than climate change
So get out your pen and paper .
I &apos;m just going to list some of them .
There are 800 million people starving .
There &apos;s a billion people without clean drinking water .
Two billion people without sanitation .
There are several million people dying of HIV and AIDS .
The lists go on and on .
There are many , many problems out there .
We don &apos;t actually solve all problems .
And that &apos;s the question I &apos;d like to ask you .
Where should we start on solving these problems ?
But that &apos;s a wrong problem to ask .
Because we can &apos;t solve problems .
To climate change that would be like Kyoto .
What should be at the bottom of the list ?
And one reason is that prioritization is incredibly uncomfortable .
Nobody wants to do this .
We have not had an idea .
We &apos;d like to know these things .
Likewise in communicable diseases .
What would be the price ?
And so on .
We called them the &quot; dream team . &quot;
And then you ask , why economists ?
That is what economists do .
They prioritize .
These were the bad projects .
Why is it it came up ?
It &apos;s not saying that global warming is not happening .
It &apos;s not saying that it &apos;s not a big problem .
That &apos;s a substantial amount of money .
Yet it would do very little good .
Which is a little good , but not very much good .
Or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good ?
And that is really why it becomes a bad project .
The fourth best problem is malaria -- dealing with malaria .
This third best one was free trade .
That would be the third best thing we could do .
The second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition .
That would be the second best investment that we could do .
One is treatment ; the other one is prevention .
And treatment is much , much more expensive than prevention .
But of course , we don &apos;t do all problems .
There are many problems out there in the world .
Even the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the U.N.
And of course , we &apos;ll be even richer than that .
We &apos;re actually talking about a fairly rich Dutch guy .
It just doesn &apos;t make for as much of a movie .
Since then our aid has halved .
I &apos;m all for that .
The majority of them were , first , from developing countries .
We &apos;ve done this many other times .
They all come out with very much the same list .
I see the Copenhagen Consensus as a process .
Thank you .
Bill Gates : Mosquitos , malaria and education
Any tough problem , I think it can be solved .
Over the past century , average lifespan has more than doubled .
It &apos;s a phenomenal thing .
Each one of those lives matters a lot .
So we really can make changes .
And I think that &apos;s doable in well under 20 years .
Well , what &apos;s the history of this disease ?
It &apos;s been a severe disease for thousands of years .
So it was absolutely gigantic .
And the disease was all over the world .
So it was everywhere .
And two tools helped bring the death rate down .
One was killing the mosquitos with DDT .
And so that &apos;s why the death rate did come down .
So we can see : 1900 , it &apos;s everywhere .
1945 , it &apos;s still most places .
1990 , you &apos;ve gotten most of the northern areas .
Now , baldness , it &apos;s a terrible thing .
And rich men are afflicted .
And so that &apos;s why that priority has been set .
Now , malaria is of course transmitted by mosquitos .
I brought some here , just so you could experience this .
We &apos;ll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit .
There &apos;s no reason only poor people should have the experience .
Those mosquitos are not infected .
And bed nets are a great tool .
And that &apos;s happened now in a number of countries .
It &apos;s great to see .
And so you end up with two choices .
And that &apos;s where we saw the malaria map shrinking .
Now we &apos;re on the upswing .
Bed net funding is up .
There &apos;s new drug discovery going on .
So we &apos;re going to have these new tools .
But that alone doesn &apos;t give us the road map .
Of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise .
And this is : How do you make a teacher great ?
And the answer is , really , that we don &apos;t .
Let &apos;s start with why this is important .
We all had a wonderful education .
I had great teachers .
There are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places .
Not only has that been weak. it &apos;s getting weaker .
And we have to change this .
We have to change it so that people have equal opportunity .
Over 30 percent of kids never finish high school .
Because they weren &apos;t tracking where the kids were before that .
But most of the dropouts had taken place before that .
For minority kids , it &apos;s over 50 percent .
And that doesn &apos;t seem entirely fair .
So , how do you make education better ?
There &apos;s many people working on it .
A lot of these things had a good effect .
How much variation is there within a school or between schools ?
And the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable .
What does that mean ?
We should retain those people .
But I can tell you that absolutely is not happening today .
What are the characteristics of this top quartile ?
What do they look like ?
You might think these must be very senior teachers .
And the answer is no .
The variation is very , very small .
You might think these are people with master &apos;s degrees .
One is seniority .
Because your pay goes up and you vest into your pension .
Teach for America : slight effect .
For math teachers majoring in math there &apos;s a measurable effect .
But , overwhelmingly , it &apos;s your past performance .
There are some people who are very good at this .
And it &apos;s a system with very high turnover .
KIPP means Knowledge Is Power .
It &apos;s an unbelievable thing .
They &apos;re team teaching . They &apos;re constantly improving their teachers .
They &apos;re deeply engaged in making teaching better .
What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
Everybody needs to be involved .
And so KIPP is doing it .
How does that compare to a normal school ?
The data isn &apos;t gathered .
And they need advanced notice to do that .
And so that &apos;s sort of working in the opposite direction .
Of course , digital video is cheap now .
And they could all sit and work together on those problems .
And I thought it was so fantastic .
It gave you a sense of what a good teacher does .
But I -- I &apos;m optimistic .
I only had time to frame those two problems .
You know , the system doesn &apos;t naturally make it happen .
Governments don &apos;t naturally pick these things in the right way .
Thank you .
Suheir Hammad : Poems of war , peace , women , power
I will not dance to that beating .
I know that beat .
It is lifeless .
I know intimately that skin you are hitting .
It was alive once , hunted , stolen , stretched .
I will not dance to your drummed-up war .
I will not pop , spin , break for you .
I will not hate for you or even hate you .
I will not kill for you .
Especially I will not die for you .
I will not mourn the dead with murder nor suicide .
Everyone can be wrong .
Life is a right , not collateral or casual .
I will not forget where I come from .
I will craft my own drum .
Gather my beloved near , and our chanting will be dancing .
Our humming will be drumming .
I will not be played .
I will dance and resist and dance and persist and dance .
This heartbeat is louder than death .
Your war drum ain &apos;t louder than this breath . Haaa .
A bunch of pacifists .
Confused , aspiring pacifists .
I understand .
I &apos;ve been wrong a lot lately .
Like a lot .
So I couldn &apos;t figure out what to read today .
I mean , I &apos;ve been saying I &apos;ve been prepping .
Poetry does that .
It preps you . It aims you .
Hold her now with you .
Are you holding her ?
This is &quot; Break Clustered . &quot;
All holy history banned .
Unwritten books predicted the future , projected the past .
Whose son shall it be ?
Which male child will perish a new day ?
Our boys &apos; deaths galvanize .
We cherish corpses .
We mourn women , complicated .
Bitches get beat daily .
Profits made , prophets ignored .
War and tooth , enameled salted lemon childhoods .
All colors run , none of us solid .
I live cycles of light and darkness .
Rhythm is half silence .
Sickness , health , tender violence .
I think now I never was pure .
Human contracted itself blind , malignant .
I never was pure .
Girl spoiled before ripened .
Language can &apos;t math me .
I experience exponentially .
Everything is everything .
One woman loses six .
One woman loses her head .
One woman searches rubble . One woman feeds on trash .
One woman shoots her face . One woman shoots her husband .
One woman straps herself .
One woman gives birth to a baby .
One woman gives birth to borders .
One woman no longer believes love will ever find her .
One woman never did .
Where do refugee hearts go ?
Faced with absence .
We mourn each one or we mean nothing at all .
My spine curves spiral .
Precipice running to and running from human beings .
Cluster bombs left behind .
De facto landmines .
A smoldering grief .
Harvest contaminated tobacco .
Harvest bombs .
Harvest baby teeth .
Harvest palms , smoke .
Harvest witness , smoke .
Resolutions , smoke .
Salvation , smoke .
Redemption , smoke .
Breathe .
Do not fear what has blown up .
If you must , fear the unexploded .
Thank you .
Saul Griffith : High-altitude wind energy from kites !
But kites aren &apos;t just toys like this .
So they knew at that stage they could carry large weights .
And that was fantastic for the future of commercial aviation .
So this is the dawn of the new age of kites .
It makes you a little nauseous .
And this is where we &apos;re actually going .
So we &apos;re beyond the 12-second steps .
So you ask , how big are those machines ?
Well , this paper plane would be maybe a -- oop !
That would be enough to power your cell phone .
Your Cessna would be 230 killowatts .
And the Spruce Goose would be a 15-megawatt wing .
So that is audacious , you say . I agree .
But audacious is what has happened many times before in history .
By 1945 , they were making 100,000 .
I am lucky enough to work with 30 of them .
Thank you .
Matthieu Ricard : The habits of happiness
There &apos;s the Mount Kailash in Eastern Tibet -- wonderful setting .
This is from Marlboro country .
This is a turquoise lake .
A meditator .
They said , &quot; Yes , but it &apos;s summertime . &quot;
So now , we are going to speak of happiness .
We like the ups and downs of life .
Now , let &apos;s come to happiness or well-being .
And that can also come from some kind of confusions .
One of the most common ones is happiness and pleasure .
It is something that -- changes of nature .
That &apos;s the nature of things . We get tired .
I can hear it two , three , five times .
It sort of uses itself as you experience it .
Now , what , then , will be happiness ?
For you , that might be surprising .
Because we are speaking of a different level .
Look at the waves coming here to shore .
You hit the solid rock .
So now , how is that ?
Even joy -- that can be the spring of happiness .
That very sentence already reveals the doom of destruction of happiness .
To have everything . If we miss something , it collapses .
And isn &apos;t that stronger ?
The experience that translates everything is within the mind .
So then , this just needs to have some experience .
There are some which are adverse to this well-being .
And also , they are detrimental to others &apos; happiness .
And we would like to be like that all the time .
You can have ugly faces , beautiful faces in the mirror .
That is the ground for mind training .
You could go from love to hate .
Benevolence , loving kindness against hatred .
So then , it &apos;s a self-perpetuating process .
Look at anger itself .
So this is the principal of mind training .
But that &apos;s the only way to go .
Mind transformation -- that is the very meaning of meditation .
So can we do that with human qualities ?
With loving kindness , with patience , with openness ?
So that &apos;s what those great meditators have been doing .
They are real Olympic champions of mind training .
Now , here with 256 electrodes .
So what did they find ? Of course , same thing .
It deals with the state of compassion , unconditional compassion .
It &apos;s something that is totally out of the bell curve .
Hopefully , they will come .
Like the startle experiments , for example .
This is not a supplementary vitamin for the soul .
We are ready to spend 15 years achieving education .
We love to do jogging , fitness .
We do all kinds of things to remain beautiful .
Now , our compassion is supposed to be put in action .
That &apos;s what we try to do in different places .
Just this one example is worth a lot of work .
One year later , how she is .
Different schools and clinics we &apos;ve been doing in Tibet .
And jumping monks of Tibet .
Flying monks .
Thank you very much .
Ariel Garten : Know thyself , with a brain scanner
&quot; Know thyself . &quot;
&quot; Know thyself . &quot;
I &apos;ve always been fascinated with knowing the self .
We &apos;ve cluttered ourselves up with all this .
It &apos;s really only a successful escape .
Think of the term we use , &quot; Retreat . &quot;
It means we &apos;ve got to get out of here .
And eventually that vacation &apos;s got to come to an end .
I say the answer is yes .
It &apos;s called thought-controlled computing .
Let me show you what it looks like .
That blue line there is my brainwave .
You &apos;re actually looking inside my head as I speak .
We were transcending the space between the mind and the device .
So controlling stuff with your mind is pretty cool .
But we &apos;re always interested in multi-tiered levels of human interaction .
And that was responsiveness .
And it could join into the relationship with you .
They followed these little shifts in your mental activity .
When you read , the desk lamp would get brighter .
That you could know something about yourself .
Here &apos;s an application that I created for the iPad .
So you use it with your headset .
The headset connects wirelessly to an iPad or a smartphone .
As you focus on the wooden form , it rotates .
The more you focus , the faster the rotation .
This is for real .
This is not a fake .
I like to call this &quot; intra-active . &quot;
Normally we think about technology as interactive .
This technology is intra-active .
So you can create applications that reward focused brain states .
This can be as effective as Ritalin .
It would be like plugging into your own personal Google .
Would you get a divorce ?
Two millennia ago , those Greeks had some powerful insights .
One moment it was all white space , pure possibility .
Thank you .
Graham Hill : Less stuff , more happiness
What &apos;s in the box ?
Sound familiar ?
Three times .
Nope .
So where does this lead ?
It &apos;s actually a great way to save you some money .
By buying a space that was 420 sq. ft .
instead of 600 , immediately I &apos;m saving 200 grand .
So how can you live little ?
Three main approaches .
First of all , you have to edit ruthlessly .
We &apos;ve got to clear the arteries of our lives .
And that shirt that I hadn &apos;t worn in years ?
It &apos;s time for me to let it go .
We need to think before we buy .
Secondly , our new mantra : small is sexy .
We want space efficiency .
Why have a six burner stove when you rarely use three ?
My office folds away , easily hidden .
My bed just pops out of the wall with two fingers .
And of course , my own movie theater .
But consider the benefits of an edited life .
Go from 3,000 to 2,000 , from 1,500 to 1,000 .
Would that give me a little more freedom ?
Maybe a little more time ? &quot;
What &apos;s in the box ?
It doesn &apos;t really matter .
I know I don &apos;t need it .
What &apos;s in yours ?
Maybe , just maybe , less might equal more .
So let &apos;s make room for the good stuff .
Thank you .
Hans Rosling : Asia &apos;s rise -- how and when
And that changed my mindset forever .
You see , I was a study nerd .
I loved statistics from a young age .
And I studied very much in Sweden .
In Sweden we read it once and then we went partying .
But I will start with a historical background .
I will start at 1858 .
1858 was a year of great technological advancement in the West .
And they were the first to &quot; Twitter &quot; transatlantically .
Because 1858 was also watershed year in the history of Asia .
And India was up to 89 years more of foreign domination .
It meant paying with opium for Chinese goods .
And let &apos;s see how much difference that can make .
The size of the bubble here is the population .
And I also bring an innovation here .
And we will see , you know .
And I will start the world like this .
India was not always like this level .
India was trying down here .
Can you see how it starts to move there ?
But really , really natural sovereignty was good for Japan .
And Japan is trying to move up there .
But careful now -- we are approaching the First World War .
United Kingdom is going down .
And now comes the Spanish flu also .
And then after the First World War , they continue up .
Not much has happened .
They have grown their population but not much more .
But they did recover quite fast afterwards .
And we are moving into the new world .
In 1947 India finally gained its independence .
And what happened ?
What happens in the after independence ?
You can see that the health started to improve .
Children started to go to school .
Health services were provided .
This is the Great Leap Forward , when China fell down .
It was central planning by Mao Tse Tung .
And they were catching up indeed .
And it was Deng Xiaoping coming out here .
Because catching mice is what the two cats wanted to do .
And the market reformer was successful there .
In &apos; 92 India follows with a market reform .
And here they march on . And will they catch up ?
This is the big question today .
There they are today .
Shanghai is already there .
And it &apos;s healthier than the United States .
The geographical , macro-geographical difference is not so big .
And here , Maharashtra , with Mumbai , is forging forward .
And that is not a bad thing , in itself .
Oh , they broke my frame .
Washington , D.C. went out here .
And I can understand him , because Washington , D.C.
It &apos;s quite interesting , isn &apos;t it ?
We have an enormous disparity in the world .
Now , back to my projections .
And then time here , from 1858 I start the world .
And we shall see what will happen with these countries .
Whereas U.K. and United States is getting richer and richer .
And after Second World War , United States is richer than U.K.
But independence is coming here .
Growth is starting , economic reform .
Look at , look at the United States .
Can you see the bubble ?
The bubbles , not my bubbles , but the financial bubbles .
You see it came down there .
And people interested in growth are turning their eyes towards Asia .
I can compare to Japan . This is Japan coming up .
You see , Japan did it like that .
We add Japan to it .
Can you see here what Japan did ?
Can be worse , can be better .
It &apos;s always difficult to predict , especially about the future .
I think I &apos;m in a difficult position here .
But what I &apos;m really worried about is war .
The 27th of July , 2048 is my 100th birthday .
Get your bookings in time . Thank you very much .
Carl Schoonover : How to look inside the brain
This is a thousand-year-old drawing of the brain .
It &apos;s a diagram of the visual system .
And some things look very familiar today .
You really would be kind of out of luck .
Nobody had had a glimpse of the brain &apos;s wiring .
It &apos;s gray , formless .
There &apos;s no structure . It won &apos;t tell you anything .
And this all changed in the late 19th century .
The computer was cracked open .
And it works in a very particular way .
It clears the forest , reveals the trees inside .
If everything had been labeled , nothing would have been visible .
So somehow it shows what &apos;s there .
And there &apos;s several ways of doing this .
But one of the most popular ones involves green fluorescent protein .
They have great explanatory power .
Thank you .
Lian Pin Koh : A drone &apos;s-eye view of conservation
So what is a drone ?
So what can we do with a conservation drone ?
But nests are not the only objects these drones can detect .
This is an oil palm plantation in Sumatra .
This is a recently logged forest , again in Sumatra .
Recently , we &apos;ve also begun experimenting with thermal imaging cameras .
We built our first prototype drones in Switzerland .
Building drones for us is a constant work in progress .
Radio collars are another tool that &apos;s commonly used by biologists .
Now these collars are put onto animals .
The MAJA drone has a wingspan of about two meters .
It is a fully autonomous system .
That is quite sufficient for most of our conservation applications .
And in a way , they are right .
Thank you .
Anthony Atala : Printing a human kidney
The fact is that we &apos;re living longer .
So this is now a public health crisis .
It really involves many different areas .
Or we can use both .
We can use , actually , biomaterials and the cells together .
And that &apos;s where the field is today .
But it &apos;s actually not a new field .
It &apos;s titled &quot; The Culture of Organs . &quot;
The first author , Alexis Carrel , a Nobel Prize winner .
But I want you to note his co-author : Charles Lindbergh .
And that really has to do to many different challenges .
And many advances now , we can do that fairly readily .
The second challenge was cells .
Over the last 20 years , we &apos;ve basically tackled that .
Many scientists can now grow many different types of cells .
Plus we have stem cells .
So we can actually use biomaterials now .
This is actually a biomaterial .
This is actually like a cotton candy machine .
You saw the spray going in .
And that &apos;s exactly what we did here .
We can also use cells alone .
These are actually cells that we obtained .
So they know what to do .
So that &apos;s actually now in patients .
Another technology that we have used in patients actually involves bladders .
We then put it in this oven-like device .
For these specific patients , we actually just suture these materials .
Another technology that we &apos;ve used is actually that of printing .
And then finally you &apos;re able to get that structure out .
That was all new bone that was implanted using these techniques .
That &apos;s what you see here on the right side .
This is how it actually works .
Here &apos;s the scanner going through , scanning the wound .
And this is actually new technology still under development .
We &apos;re also working on more sophisticated printers .
Because in reality , our biggest challenge are the solid organs .
This actually shows the actual printer .
And this actually shows that printing .
In fact , we actually have the printer right here .
Put a pair of gloves here .
Thank you .
Go backwards .
Has a little bit of consistency to it .
Thank you , Dr. Kang . I appreciate it .
So this is actually a new generation .
This is actually the printer that you see here onstage .
I was missing school . It was pretty much miserable .
I felt so sick .
I was able to do more things .
I was able to wrestle in high school .
I was able to be a normal kid with my friends .
Luke , come up please .
JE : And Tony &apos;s done hundreds of these ?
I pulled them aside .
Thank you so much .
JE : Thank you , Tony .
Tom Shannon , John Hockenberry : The painter and the pendulum
And I did one that was about 35 feet long .
JH : Is there a relief in playing with these forces ?
TS : Those are permanent magnets , yeah .
TS : Yeah .
It &apos;s really unsatisfactory having plug-in art .
JH : I agree .
My sculptures are normally very simplified .
I try to refine them down to very simple forms .
JH : And they &apos;re non-deterministic .
TS : No .
But then I started dreaming of having six colors .
JH : It looks like we &apos;re loaded for bear here .
JH : Thanks guys .
JH : Whoa . That is ...
ooh , nice .
TS : So something like this .
JH : That &apos;s fantastic .
JH : So many forces there .
Like the occurrence of moire patterns .
TS : It is the paint actually , makes it real .
It &apos;s really manifested there .
There are lots of things that appear .
So I think , conceivably , those could be predictive .
Is that relevant to your work ?
I mean , I &apos;ve got the symptoms .
I &apos;m left-handed , and so I draw .
JH : So you &apos;re not a gatekeeper for these forces .
You think of yourself as the servant .
TS : Nature is -- well , it &apos;s a godsend .
It just has so much in it .
And we are expressions of the universe , basically .
It &apos;s a terrific studio assistant .
TS : Thank you , John .
Moshe Safdie : How to reinvent the apartment building
We traveled the country .
Those who have no choice lived there .
There has to be another way of doing this .
It &apos;s a very desirable place to live in .
In 1973 , I made my first trip to China .
It was the Cultural Revolution .
We traveled the country , met with architects and planners .
Shenzhen didn &apos;t even exist as a city .
There were hardly any cars .
Thirty years later , this is Beijing today .
This is Hong Kong .
Could we make it more affordable ?
And we mapped all the building area in Manhattan .
It &apos;s permeable .
And most important , permeable , open .
That &apos;s measured in the winter solstice .
And Colombo .
And that &apos;s all I can tell you in five minutes .
Thank you .
Siegfried Woldhek : The search for the true face of Leonardo
Good morning .
But we do not know his face .
Even this well-known portrait is not accepted by many art historians .
So , what do you think ?
Let &apos;s find out .
Leonardo was a man that drew everything around him .
But no faces ?
I find that hard to believe .
So let &apos;s try to find them .
There are about 120 , you see them here .
Which ones of these could be self-portraits ?
So we can eliminate all the profiles .
It also has to be sufficiently detailed .
So we can also eliminate the ugly ones or the caricatures .
And here they are .
So I know a little about drawing and analyzing faces .
OK , now let &apos;s look at these three portraits .
I couldn &apos;t believe my eyes when I first saw that .
There is no reason why these portraits should look alike .
Now , are they made in the right order ?
The young man should be made first .
They are made in the right order .
Well , we need a reference .
Ladies and gentlemen , this story has not yet been published .
The icon of icons finally has a face .
Here he is : Leonardo da Vinci .
Eric Dishman : Health care should be a team sport
They don &apos;t know anything about you . Wake up .
And I did .
It &apos;s unaffordable globally .
We need to invent what I call a personal health system .
This is the kidney transplant I was never supposed to have .
Don &apos;t you in the front row worry or anything .
This is a portable ultrasound .
All right , I gotta gel up .
Now the people in the front row are very nervous .
And actually , can you see Libby ?
Thomas Batuik : Hi there , Eric .
You look busy . How are you ?
Should I do that again ?
TB : Yeah , let &apos;s do that .
It &apos;s not something I was very happy about .
So let &apos;s start with care anywhere .
This was me in third grade .
Recovering from the surgery in the hospital , I get bedsores .
Now the software is also getting smarter , right ?
And I have these palpitations that are showing up .
I had a care coordination problem .
And this happens to millions of people every year .
Now this is the most frightening thing to me .
And this is a picture of my graduation team from Legacy .
I wept the day I graduated .
And here &apos;s the most important part .
That &apos;s the only way that the model works .
And I think that &apos;s why I achieved longevity .
Tracey Gamley : For me , it was really easy .
I only had one night in the hospital .
Dennis Hong : My seven species of robot
So , the first robot to talk about is called STriDER .
It stands for Self-excited Tripedal Dynamic Experimental Robot .
But before that , let &apos;s look at pop culture .
But my robot , STriDER , does not move like this .
So , this is an actual dynamic simulation animation .
I &apos;m just going to show you how the robot works .
We call that the concept of passive dynamic locomotion .
potential energy to kinetic energy , potential energy to kinetic energy .
It &apos;s a constantly falling process .
So we have two prototypes .
The first version , in the back , that &apos;s STriDER I.
The one in front , the smaller , is STriDER II .
The second robot I want to talk about is called IMPASS .
It stands for Intelligent Mobility Platform with Actuated Spoke System .
So , it &apos;s a wheel-leg hybrid robot .
We are literally re-inventing the wheel here .
Let me demonstrate how it works .
You probably haven &apos;t seen anything like this out there .
Ah , isn &apos;t that cool ?
The front wheels rotate like this .
We just simply change the length of the spoke .
But the current rovers cannot get there .
So , this is CLIMBeR .
Also for search and rescue applications as well .
And they already had a six legged robot called LEMUR .
We developed our adaptive gait planner .
We actually have a very interesting payload on there .
We get so many visitors visiting our lab .
Welcome to RoMeLa , the Robotics Mechanisms Laboratory at Virginia Tech .
This robot is an amoeba robot .
So , this is some of the early feasibility experiments .
Robotic Air Powered Hand with Elastic Ligaments .
We developed these novel actuators for joints .
And it can actually crush an empty soda can .
This is a robot that can climb structures .
This is a HyDRAS &apos;s arm .
It &apos;s a 12 degrees of freedom robotic arm .
But the cool part is the user interface .
The cable over there , that &apos;s an optical fiber .
Now , this robot is currently our star robot .
So , this does not have any sensors .
So , it &apos;s an open loop control .
And thus , DARwIn I was born in 2005 .
It stands up , it walks -- very impressive .
And now DARwIn II is completely autonomous .
It is not remote controlled .
It &apos;s an international autonomous robot soccer competition .
So , this is last year in China .
This is this year in Austria .
There you go . Yes !
The robots track and they team play amongst themselves .
Louis Vuitton Cup trophy .
Thank you .
DARwIn also has a lot of other talents .
And it walks away . So , this is DARwIn IV .
So , what is the secret of our success ?
Where do we come up with these ideas ?
How do we develop these kinds of ideas ?
We call it the Blind Driver Challenge , very exciting .
So , really , we have five secrets .
First is : Where do we get inspiration ?
Where do we get this spark of imagination ?
This is a true story , my personal story .
And they assemble , and they form these kinds of mechanisms .
And then I think , &quot; Ah this is cool . &quot;
So , I need to decipher what I wrote .
But just a spark of imagination is not good enough .
How do we develop these kinds of ideas ?
But before we start we set this golden rule .
The rule is : Nobody criticizes anybody &apos;s ideas .
Nobody criticizes any opinion .
And this is how we develop our ideas .
He gave a talk about how education and school kills creativity .
Well , actually , there are two sides to the story .
Math , differential equations .
These are all the tools that we need .
So , education is very important .
There you go . Thank you so much .
Mikko Hypponen : Fighting viruses , defending the net
I love the Internet .
It &apos;s true .
Think about everything it has brought us .
And it &apos;s happening during our lifetimes .
I &apos;ve spent my career fighting these problems .
So let me show you something .
This here is Brain .
It &apos;s the first virus we ever found for PC computers .
And we actually know where Brain came from .
We know because it says so inside the code .
Let &apos;s take a look .
All right .
And Basit and Amjad are first names , Pakistani first names .
Now , 1986 .
Now it &apos;s 2011 .
That &apos;s 25 years ago .
The PC virus problem is 25 years old now .
Here &apos;s a typical street view .
And I knocked on the door .
You want to guess who opened the door ?
Basit and Amjad ; they are still there .
So here standing up is Basit .
Sitting down is his brother Amjad .
These are the guys who wrote the first PC virus .
Now of course , we had a very interesting discussion .
I asked them why .
I asked them how they feel about what they started .
So let me just mount some drives . Go over there .
What we have here is a list of old viruses .
So let me just run some viruses on my computer .
For example , let &apos;s go with the Centipede virus first .
You know that you &apos;re infected because it actually shows up .
Let me show you one which actually makes some sound .
And the last example , guess what the Walker virus does ?
Today , viruses are a global problem .
And if we just scroll around , it &apos;s just massive .
We find tens of thousands , even hundreds of thousands .
So where are all these coming from then ?
It &apos;s gangs like -- let &apos;s go to GangstaBucks.com.
And they &apos;ll actually pay you money for those computers .
So how do these guys then monetize those infected computers ?
Same thing with every single password and so on .
And that , obviously , is a problem .
They are both right now on the run .
Nobody knows where they are .
So the amount of money online crime generates is significant .
They also use the global nature of Internet to their advantage .
I mean , the Internet is international .
That &apos;s why we call it the Internet .
So you just can &apos;t shut these guys down .
So how do you actually go around finding online criminals ?
How do you actually track them down ?
Let me give you an example .
What we have here is one exploit file .
It has been encrypted with XOR function 97 .
And we can go here and actually start decrypting it .
Well the yellow part of the code is now decrypted .
But just keep staring at it .
And that &apos;s a backdoor which will take over your computer .
It &apos;s not used for anything .
So obviously I Googled for it .
I got zero hits ; wasn &apos;t there .
So I spoke with the guys at the lab .
And he drives a very nice car .
How do I know about this car ?
Because he blogged about the car .
He actually had a car accident .
So what happens when online criminals are caught ?
Well in most cases it never gets this far .
I wish it would be easier ; unfortunately it isn &apos;t .
But things are also changing at a very rapid pace .
You &apos;ve all heard about things like Stuxnet .
And this is what runs our infrastructure .
This is what runs everything around us .
Because everything around us is being run by these .
I mean , we have critical infrastructure .
Everything is being run by computers .
Everything is reliant on these computers working .
Think about all the services we have online .
That &apos;s much more important than running anti-viruses or running firewalls .
Thank you very much .
Rogier van der Heide : Why light needs darkness
Well that was not by me .
So this is how we normally would light our offices .
The sun is for dynamics , for color changes .
So in an indirect way , you can see the sun .
They allowed themselves a few mistakes along the way .
They are in green energy consulting , or something like that .
I really owe a short introduction of this man to you .
So you begin with focal glow .
Ambient luminescence is something very different .
And we can only create these out of darkness .
And I will explain that further .
And you can imagine a lot more applications .
And it is all about this planet .
Because all this light here goes up to the sky .
It never reaches the ground where it was meant for .
It never is to the benefit of people .
It only spoils the darkness .
So at a global scale , it looks like this .
How do they share their culture ?
How do we tackle things like mobility ?
And how can light help there ?
So here it is .
And I will very quickly show you how it works .
So just to explain .
Now this is not very pleasant and comfortable .
So you can preserve the darkness and make the light .
Thank you .
We can go further .
So we have to rethink the way we light our cities .
We have to think again about light as a default solution .
Why are all these motorways permanently lit ?
Is it really needed ?
Can we be more gentle with light ?
Like here -- this is a very low light level actually .
And can we preserve the darkness ?
They are not disturbed anymore .
Where have they come from ? Where are they going ?
We can do that in commercial spaces like this .
In architecture , it works just the same .
It wouldn &apos;t be such an inspiring scenography without this theater .
Thank you very much .
Eva Zeisel : The playful search for beauty
And I am illustrating Still .
So this takes care of my age .
This was about 1925 .
All of these things were made during the last 75 years .
This was an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art .
This is now for sale at the Metropolitan Museum .
This is still at the Metropolitan Museum now for sale .
This is a portrait of my daughter and myself .
These were just some of the things I &apos;ve made .
I made hundreds of them for the last 75 years .
I call myself a maker of things .
Industrial designers want to make novel things .
Novelty is a concept of commerce , not an aesthetic concept .
Innovation is not part of the aim of my work .
Let me tell you some about my life .
The work as an apprentice was very primitive .
And then finally it was prepared for the throwing .
And there I really worked as an apprentice .
I said , I also have a pottery .
I remember that it was quite successful .
And that was in Hamburg .
This was my first job .
Eva Zeisel : Are you sure ?
Moderator : Yes , I am sure .
This was a very dangerous accusation .
Weren &apos;t you there recently ?
Bonnie Bassler : How bacteria &quot; talk &quot;
Bacteria are the oldest living organisms on the earth .
You have about 30,000 genes .
We &apos;re not doing anything to the cells here .
This is now supposed to be my bacterial cell .
When it &apos;s alone it doesn &apos;t make any light .
This is like the stealth bomber of the ocean .
Bacteria always control pathogenicity with quorum sensing .
That &apos;s how it works .
This is the Vibrio fischeri molecule .
This is the word that it talks with .
Each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other .
So these are private , secret conversations .
These conversations are for intraspecies communication .
It &apos;s a very small , five-carbon molecule .
So they &apos;re all using this molecule for interspecies communication .
This is the bacterial Esperanto .
Couldn &apos;t these be new kinds of antibiotics ?
The first one is we &apos;ve targeted the intraspecies communication system .
We &apos;ve also done the same thing with the pink system .
To finish I &apos;ll just show you the strategy .
We think bacteria made the rules for how multicellular organization works .
This is exactly what happens in your body .
Science is done by that demographic .
It &apos;s a really lucky demographic to work with .
I want to thank you for inviting me here .
Thanks .
Richard Baraniuk : The birth of the open-source learning revolution
I &apos;m Rich Baraniuk .
Does anybody remember these ?
Today &apos;s hit single is not last year &apos;s hit single .
But , I &apos;m not here to talk about music today .
I &apos;m here to talk about books .
Has anyone here ever been to school ?
So , imagine taking all the world &apos;s books .
Think of it as a massive iTunes for book type content .
In fact , this dream is actually being realized .
We &apos;re working on the open-source tools and the content .
Her material is now used over 600,000 times per month .
Tremendous , tremendous use .
What about copying , reusing , right ?
A little present for you .
It &apos;s about 300 pages long , hardbound .
This costs , anybody guess ?
How much would it cost in a bookstore ?
Audience : 65 dollars .
Richard Baraniuk : This costs 22 dollars to the student .
Why does it cost 22 dollars ?
We &apos;re talking about books on hyper geometric partial differential equations .
OK , so what are the enablers ?
What &apos;s really making all of this happen ?
How many people know about XML ?
Remember we took the book , tore the pages out ?
So imagine your kid &apos;s algebra textbook in seventh grade .
The same type of mark-up , like mathML , for chemistry .
Even the three wise men .
We can &apos;t let this Napster thing happen here .
And the ideas , the creative commons licenses .
How many people have heard of creative commons ?
If you have not , you must learn about it . Creativecommons.org.
We &apos;re not talking about Harry Potter , right ?
We &apos;re at the long tail end here .
How do we protect it into the future ?
So that could be a problem .
Connexions and open content is all about sharing knowledge .
So , thanks very much .
Sam Martin : Claim your &quot; manspace &quot;
It had everything I needed . It was quiet .
So I did some research .
And I found that there was an historic precedence .
Hemingway had his writing space .
But on the inside , it &apos;s anything but .
And this , to me , is a pretty classic manspace .
And he found the scoreboard in the trash .
Here &apos;s another outdoor space , a little bit more sophisticated .
The guy did it all himself .
And there is about 1,000 square feet of hanging-out space inside .
There were definitely hang-out spots .
Take this place for example .
On the outside it looks like a typical northeastern garage .
This is in Long Island , New York .
It has no nails or screws .
All the joints are hand-carved and hand-scribed .
And so there is a good reason for this .
It was built by this man who is Wayne McCullough .
Museum quality .
And they were unexpected and they were surprising .
And they really loved their professions .
And they were very passionate about their collections and their hobbies .
Thank you very much .
Stefon Harris : There are no mistakes on the bandstand
It is really a sacred space .
You really are alive right here in this moment .
But that could have happened -- maybe , maybe not .
Everyone &apos;s listening . We &apos;re responding .
You have no time for projected ideas .
Every &quot; mistake &quot; is an opportunity in jazz .
So if Christian played a note -- like play an F.
See , these are all right inside of the color palette .
If you played an E.
And we &apos;re going to play on this palette .
And at some point , Christian will introduce this note .
And we won &apos;t react to it .
We &apos;ll see what happens when we play with this palette .
So someone could conceptually perceive that as a mistake .
It was an opportunity that was missed .
So it &apos;s unpredictable . We &apos;ll paint this palette again .
We &apos;ll all accept his ideas , or not .
So you see , he played this note .
I ended up creating a melody out of it .
The texture changed in the drums this time .
So there is no mistake .
So jazz , this bandstand is absolutely amazing .
It &apos;s a very purifying experience .
So how does this all relate to behavioral finance ?
You have some people who do .
But what that does is it actually limits the artistic possibilities .
ready , just play some time .
One , two , one , two , three , four .
It &apos;s kind of chaotic because I &apos;m bullying my ideas .
This is a science of listening .
Totally different experience when I &apos;m pulling ideas .
It &apos;s much more organic . It &apos;s much more nuanced .
It &apos;s not about bullying my vision or anything like that .
Thank you .
One is the Thylacine Project .
We &apos;ve lost a whole family .
That &apos;s a big chunk of the global genome gone .
I &apos;d like it back .
The second reason is that we killed these things .
Okay . Let me talk to you about the Lazarus Project .
It &apos;s a frog . And you think , frog .
Yeah , but this was not just any frog .
Now , when biologists saw this , they were agog .
They thought , this is incredible .
And just as everybody got excited about it , bang !
It was extinct .
Well , we looked at the tissue under the microscope .
So we thought , let &apos;s give it a go .
What we did is something called somatic cell nuclear transplantation .
We used ultraviolet radiation to do that .
That was a miracle , but it was workable .
That was so exciting . And then the egg divided again .
So we &apos;re very excited . This is not a tadpole .
Thank you .
But it &apos;s not related to any of those .
But it &apos;s also a tragic history .
In those fossil rocks are some amazing animals .
We found marsupial lions .
We found carnivorous kangaroos .
And crocodiles were not behaving at that time either .
That similarity meant they probably competed .
They were eating the same kinds of foods .
That guy is going to eat all our sheep .
That was not what happened , actually .
Have a look at this bit of film footage .
Does it have to stay this way ?
In 1990 , I was in the Australian Museum .
The geneticists laughed . But this was six years before Dolly .
Cloning was science fiction . It had not happened .
But then suddenly cloning did happen .
I put a team together .
We were very excited .
Unfortunately , we also found a lot of human DNA .
We found nuclear mitochondrial genes . It &apos;s there .
So we got it .
Okay . What could we do with this stuff ?
It has to be a different species .
They &apos;re related distantly to thylacines .
Critics of this project say , hang on .
Thylacine , Tasmanian devil ? That &apos;s going to hurt .
No , it &apos;s not . These are marsupials .
Is this a risk ?
Are we going to get a Frankenstein ?
You know , some kind of weird hybrid chimera ?
And the answer is no .
This is a key question for everybody .
He led them around on a rope .
We &apos;d all love to have this sort of thing happen .
My interest was in whether the environment had changed .
He looked at the hut . We went inside .
The grasslands were sweeping away .
That &apos;s classic thylacine habitat .
So could we put it back ? Yes .
We need other parallel strategies coming online .
And this one interests me .
And I &apos;m positive it wouldn &apos;t .
We need to think about this in today &apos;s world .
Thank you .
Mohamed Hijri : A simple solution to the coming phosphorus crisis
Okay , so most of you are .
I think we can all agree it &apos;s a serious issue .
Right ?
For the simple reason that nobody else is talking about it .
The answer is that it comes from how we farm .
We use fertilizers in our farming , chemical fertilizers .
Why do we use chemical fertilizers in agriculture ?
So , what does a plant need in order to grow ?
So , the plant &apos;s roots will extract these resources .
Why phosphorus in particular ?
Because it is the most problematic chemical element .
Cell membranes are phosphorus-based : These are called phospholipids .
The energy in all living things , ATP , is phosphorus-based .
DNA is our genetic heritage .
Now , where do we find this phosphorus ?
As humans , where do we find it ?
It &apos;s true that some humans eat better than others .
Some are happier than others .
Intensive agriculture is based on the use of chemical fertilizers .
Let me explain .
You &apos;re going to tell me it &apos;s wasteful .
Eighty percent of each dose of phosphorus is lost .
Modern agriculture depends on phosphorus .
Now , where will we get this phosphorus from ?
Basically , we get it out of mines .
So that really puts it into perspective .
So , we get phosphorus from mines .
What is the current state of the world &apos;s phosphorus reserves ?
The black line represents predictions for phosphorus reserves .
In 2030 , we &apos;ll reach the peak .
The dotted line shows where we are today .
Do we have a solution ?
Less and less phosphorus will be available .
What should we do ?
It truly is a paradoxical situation .
Remember that 80 percent is destined to be lost .
This mushroom exists in symbiosis with the roots .
This slide illustrates the elements of a mycorrhiza .
Normally , a root will find phosphorus all by itself .
Beyond one millimeter , the root is ineffective .
It cannot go further in its search for phosphorus .
Now , imagine this tiny , microscopic mushroom .
And it is through this structure that mutual exchanges will occur .
True symbiosis .
A very small amount of phosphorus will remain in the soil .
That &apos;s completely natural .
The plant is only able to seek out soluble forms .
These are trials in a field of sorghum .
With only a half-dose , we achieved a better yield .
This is to show you that this method works .
This is an example of soy production in Canada .
Mycorrhiza was used in one field but not in the other .
The problem is that people are not aware of it .
In conclusion , I am a scientist and a dreamer .
I &apos;m passionate about this topic .
Thank you for your attention .
To the first son , he left half the camels .
Well three sons got into a negotiation .
Seventeen doesn &apos;t divide by two .
It doesn &apos;t divide by three .
It doesn &apos;t divide by nine .
Brotherly tempers started to get strained .
So then they had 18 camels .
You get 17 .
They had one camel left over .
They gave it back to the wise old woman .
I basically see humanity a bit like those three brothers .
We &apos;re all one family .
That &apos;s the question .
It &apos;s actually surprisingly simple .
It &apos;s not easy , but it &apos;s simple .
It &apos;s not even new .
It may be one of our most ancient human heritages .
The secret to peace is us .
Let me give you just a story , an example .
So how do they deal with their differences ?
That system , I call the &quot; third side . &quot;
And we can play an incredibly constructive role .
It &apos;s very easy to react .
Human beings -- we &apos;re reaction machines .
And so the third side reminds us of that .
There was a war going on , as you know .
Look at what you Americans are doing in Puerto Rico . &quot;
The conversation got back on track .
Question is : where &apos;s the third side there ?
How could we possibly go to the balcony ?
Let me just ask you one question first .
Just out of curiosity , how many of you ?
Okay , so the great majority of us .
And here , it &apos;s so far away .
Why do we pay so much attention to this conflict ?
Is it the number of deaths ?
Stories matter . As an anthropologist , I know that .
Stories are what we use to transmit knowledge .
They give meaning to our lives .
Stories are the key .
What would that mean ? What is the story there ?
What &apos;s the origin story of the Middle East ?
That man , of course , was Abraham .
He &apos;s the father of us all .
That &apos;s what he &apos;s known for , his hospitality .
Today we face the scourge of terrorism .
What is terrorism ?
What &apos;s the opposite of terrorism ?
What if that could be a vaccine against religious intolerance ?
How would you bring that story to life ?
And that was my thinking of how would you do that .
And that &apos;s what comes to the first step here .
You retrace the footsteps of Abraham .
Because walking has a real power .
Who fights while they walk ?
People said , &quot; That &apos;s crazy . You can &apos;t .
You &apos;ve got to cross all these borders .
And so we studied the idea at Harvard .
We did our due diligence .
So effectively , we went from womb to tomb .
Let me ask you a question .
How many of you have ever had that experience ?
That &apos;s the essence of the Abraham path .
He &apos;s alive ; he &apos;s a living presence .
It &apos;s an amazing experience .
It was Abraham Path Day .
The media love it ; they really adore it .
It brought us hope .
And so that &apos;s what it &apos;s about .
She &apos;s desperately poor .
They sit on the floor .
She doesn &apos;t even have a tablecloth .
That &apos;s the potential of the Abraham path .
The potential is basically to change the game .
And in that sense , the Abraham path is a game-changer .
Let me just show you one thing .
What would the oak tree look like ?
It was done in South Africa .
It was done in Northern Ireland .
It could be done anywhere .
It simply depends on us .
It depends on us taking the third side .
We &apos;re about to take a break in a moment .
That &apos;s a third side act .
That &apos;s walking Abraham &apos;s path .
After a TEDTalk , why not a TEDWalk ?
So let me just leave you with three things .
One is , the secret to peace is the third side .
The third side is us .
Thank you very much .
Shereen El Feki : A little-told tale of sex and sensuality
&quot; I have two medical certificates to prove it . &quot;
I &apos;m half Egyptian , and I &apos;m Muslim .
The first of these is politics .
That second red line is religion .
Audience : Sex .
Shereen El Feki : Louder , I can &apos;t hear you .
Audience : Sex .
SEF : Again , please don &apos;t be shy .
Audience : Sex .
SEF : Absolutely , that &apos;s right , it &apos;s sex .
Marriage is your ticket to adulthood .
Faiza was living proof of this .
Her virginity statement was not a piece of wishful thinking .
Faiza chose a different route : non-vaginal sex .
Only she became pregnant all the same .
Sadly , Faiza is not alone .
Football , everybody talks about it , but hardly anyone plays .
Hot stuff !
Today , this history is largely unknown in the Arab region .
no matter where we live and love .
Thank you .
iO Tillett Wright : Fifty shades of gay
What &apos;s your name ? Where are you from ?
How old are you ? What do you do ?
Then we get more personal with it .
Have you ever had any diseases ?
Have you ever been divorced ?
What are you into ? Who are you into ?
What gender do you like to sleep with ?
I get it .
We are neurologically hardwired to seek out people like ourselves .
We seek out environments that reinforce our personal choices .
Because the categories , I &apos;ve found , are too limiting .
The boxes are too narrow .
And this can get really dangerous .
I grew up in a very sheltered environment .
They said they wouldn &apos;t let girls play .
I mean , who knows , right ?
When you &apos;re six , maybe you can do that .
I kept up the charade for eight years .
So this is me when I was 11 .
I didn &apos;t feel like I was in the wrong body .
I felt like I was performing this elaborate act .
I wouldn &apos;t have qualified as transgender .
No one is exactly shocked .
But I wasn &apos;t asked to define myself by my parents .
I was legally and indisputably a second-class citizen .
I was not an activist .
I wave no flags in my own life .
Were we even a group ? What group ?
It might give them pause .
And they funded two weeks of shooting in New York .
And then we made this .
Self Evident Truths is a photographic record of LGBTQ America today .
It &apos;s written in the Declaration of Independence .
There is no equality in the United States .
The fight for equal rights is not just about gay marriage .
So far we &apos;ve shot 300 faces in New York City .
I want to take the project across the country .
Absolutely nothing could have prepared us for what happened after that .
So I changed my immediate goal to 10,000 faces .
Visibility really is key .
Familiarity really is the gateway drug to empathy .
Sparking empathy had become the backbone of Self Evident Truths .
In fact , on the contrary , it highlights them .
Can you quantify your openness ?
I &apos;ll take your picture just for trying .
And the reality that this presents is a complicated one .
Where exactly does one become a second-class citizen ?
What we see are human beings in all their multiplicity .
And seeing them makes it harder to deny their humanity .
It &apos;s too late .
Because I already am all of those things .
Thank you .
I just wanted you to know that .
So as I said , neurosurgery comes from a long tradition .
It &apos;s been around for about 7,000 years .
They didn &apos;t know exactly what they were doing .
Not much has changed , by the way .
But this was common .
We can turn it up or down , on or off .
So this looks something like this .
That &apos;s a little better . That side is better .
We &apos;re now going to turn it on .
It &apos;s on . Just turned it on .
And this works like that , instantly .
We want you to stop doing that . &quot;
And we do that with electricity .
So dystonia is a disorder affecting children .
There are eight children in the family .
Five of them have dystonia .
So here he is .
So he is one of five kids .
He did not respond to any drugs .
We did not know what to do with this boy .
It is the sadness center of the brain .
And so patients with depression have hyperactivity .
The area of the brain for sadness is on red hot .
So we went ahead and implanted electrodes in patients with depression .
This is work done with my colleague Helen Mayberg from Emory .
Can we use deep brain stimulation to make you smarter ?
Anybody interested in that ?
Of course we can , right ?
Now we &apos;re not going to do this in normal people .
They shut down . They turn off .
These areas of the brain are shut down .
The lights are out in these areas of the brain .
So this is now in clinical trials .
We can now reach those circuits .
We can introduce electrodes within those circuits .
We can graduate the activity of those circuits .
Thank you very much .
Damon Horowitz : Philosophy in prison
Meet Tony . He &apos;s my student .
There &apos;s the punk on the ground , puddle of blood .
I know what is wrong . I have done wrong .
You think you know right and wrong ?
Then can you tell me what wrong is ?
No , don &apos;t just give me an example .
What is that idea ?
What makes something wrong ?
Maybe one of us is wrong about the wrong .
We are here for knowledge .
Our enemy is thoughtlessness . This is philosophy . &quot;
And something changes for Tony .
I want to know what is wrong .
I want to know what I know . &quot;
What can creatures like us know of such things ?
Socrates died in prison , his philosophy intact .
So Tony starts doing his homework .
Turns out , Tony &apos;s got the philosophy muscle .
His body is in prison , but his mind is free .
That &apos;s Plato , Descartes , Nietzsche and Bill Clinton .
Let us think about that . &quot;
Thank you .
Halla Tomasdottir : A feminine response to Iceland &apos;s financial crash
First , of course , the economic meltdown .
Ninety-nine pence was the starting price and no reserve .
By the way , the pronunciation is &quot; Eyjafjallajokull . &quot;
None of your media got it right .
Raised quite a few eyebrows in Iceland .
So let me share with you our values .
We believe in risk awareness .
What does that mean ?
Not a complicated thing .
We care how we make our profit .
It was also about a business opportunity .
Will government change ?
Well I &apos;ll give you my straight talk about this .
Like TED , I believe in people .
Women in Iceland took the day off .
And some say this was the start of a global movement .
So we should embrace our difference and aim for challenge .
We need to start embracing the beauty of balance .
Thank you .
Kate Hartman : The art of wearable communication
My name is Kate Hartman .
I teach courses in physical computing and wearable electronics .
And it &apos;s pretty simple .
Everybody &apos;s got one -- all of you .
Don &apos;t be ashamed .
So I make other hats as well .
This one is called the Talk to Yourself Hat .
It &apos;s fairly self-explanatory .
It physically carves out conversation space for one .
So what happens when a person puts this thing on ?
What kind of an experience do they have ?
And how are they transformed by wearing it ?
So this particular device is called the Gut Listener .
And some of these are actually meant to mediate experiences .
So the Discommunicator is a tool for arguments .
And I thought , &quot; Well , hey !
Because there seems to be an issue .
The glaciers are actually leaving us .
There &apos;s no kind of social protocol for this .
I really just don &apos;t even know how to say hello .
Do I carve a message in the snow ?
And I was really struck by how much it affected me .
So , yea , this is actually just the beginning .
These are initial musings for this project .
Thanks .
We are always chasing storms .
We are doing a thousand now .
And we hope to understand something fundamental about our human nature .
You can put it louder if you can .
This is a brain .
And you have a scheme here that describes how it works .
And that &apos;s exactly what we did 10 years ago .
And Aurora liked to play video games .
Actually any primate will do that .
Think about that .
And to our shock , that &apos;s exactly what Aurora did .
She played the game without moving her body .
Well , we did that 10 years ago .
Just fast forward 10 years .
And that &apos;s exactly what they do .
The animal is controlling the avatar to touch the targets .
And that &apos;s a picture that every neurophysiologist knows .
How far can we take it ?
So where are we taking all this ?
And you can see an image produced by this consortium .
I think I &apos;m going to follow my grandmother &apos;s advice .
Thank you .
Lisa Margonelli : The political chemistry of oil
The napalm is burning there quite nicely .
So this is what happens as that burn gets going .
It takes off . It &apos;s a big woosh .
It &apos;ll just bake your retinas .
Oil is a stew of hydrocarbon molecules .
They &apos;re very important in oil spills .
It is this chemistry that makes oil so disastrous .
Oil doesn &apos;t sink , it floats .
It also makes it very viscous .
It &apos;s incredibly hard to clean up .
And every single oil is different when it hits water .
They set the prices , and I don &apos;t even know .
I am helpless over this . &quot;
That shows you how bad it is .
And that &apos;s actually very perverse .
This is BP &apos;s gas station in downtown Los Angeles .
It is green . It is a shrine to greenishness .
And we get kind of in on our own con .
We talk about energy independence . We talk about hydrogen cars .
We talk about biofuels that haven &apos;t been invented yet .
It &apos;s the &quot; Beverly Hillbillies , &quot; basically .
And then , of course , there was John D. Rockefeller .
There were no lips .
Okay , so that guy is actually still with us .
And then there &apos;s this guy , okay .
So I &apos;m saying this is kind of a distraction .
You have these pictures of birds .
They really influence people .
It started Earth Day .
Everything that we are really stemmed from this period .
We connect the dots in the supply chain .
In fact , it &apos;s continued to increase .
We put it in . There was a tremendous banditry problem .
I was there in 2003 .
We pay for it in our taxes on April 15th .
It &apos;s become this intense industrialized zone .
And finally , American families also pay a price for oil .
We need to stay away from the moratoriums .
We need to focus really back again on the molecules .
We need to focus on reducing the oil .
We need to remove the perverse incentives to use more fuel .
We actually encourage people to drive more .
We need to have more mobility choices .
They &apos;re up at NewAmerica.net.
So you &apos;re not helpless at the pump .
That &apos;s a lot .
So , three million barrels a day .
Thank you .
Ludwick Marishane : A bath without water
The Limpopo sun gets really hot in winter .
Now we need to get this thing into practice .
I had invented DryBath , the world &apos;s first bath-substituting lotion .
So we packaged DryBath in these innovative little sachets .
At least once a week .
What &apos;s stopping you ?
I &apos;m not done yet . I &apos;m not done yet .
David Steindl-Rast : Want to be happy ? Be grateful
In this , we are all together .
Now my topic is gratefulness .
How is the connection between happiness and gratefulness ?
Many people would say , well , that &apos;s very easy .
When you are happy , you are grateful .
But think again .
Is it really the happy people that are grateful ?
They radiate happiness . You are surprised .
Why ? Because they are grateful .
So it is not happiness that makes us grateful .
It &apos;s gratefulness that makes us happy .
It &apos;s gratefulness that makes you happy .
And how does it work ?
I appeal to your own experience .
We all know from experience how it goes .
We experience something that &apos;s valuable to us .
Something is given to us that &apos;s valuable to us .
And it &apos;s really given .
These two things have to come together .
You haven &apos;t bought it . You haven &apos;t earned it .
It &apos;s just given to you .
That &apos;s how gratefulness happens .
We cannot only have grateful experiences .
We can be people who live gratefully .
Grateful living , that is the thing .
And how can we live gratefully ?
It &apos;s a gift . You haven &apos;t earned it .
You haven &apos;t brought it about in any way .
It &apos;s a given moment , as we say .
Well , think again .
Behold the master key to our happiness in our own hands .
Moment by moment , we can be grateful for this gift .
Does that mean that we can be grateful for everything ?
Certainly not .
But I didn &apos;t say we can be grateful for everything .
It isn &apos;t as bad as it might seem .
Learning patience , for instance .
That takes patience . That &apos;s difficult .
That &apos;s an opportunity that is given to us .
They make something out of life .
And those who fail get another opportunity .
We always get another opportunity .
That &apos;s the wonderful richness of life .
So how can we find a method that will harness this ?
How can we do it ?
It &apos;s a very simple method .
Stop . Look . Go .
That &apos;s all .
But how often do we stop ?
We rush through life . We don &apos;t stop .
We miss the opportunity because we don &apos;t stop .
We have to stop . We have to get quiet .
And we have to build stop signs into our lives .
Every time I turned on the faucet , I was overwhelmed .
But after a while , this wears off .
So leave it up to your own imagination .
You look . You open your eyes .
You open your ears . You open your nose .
A grateful world is a world of joyful people .
We couldn &apos;t understand why it mushroomed .
And there have been 15 million candles lit in one decade .
Thank you .
Julian Treasure : Shh ! Sound health in 8 steps
Every part of your body is vibrating at different frequencies .
Your ears are always on -- you have no ear lids .
They work even when you sleep .
Ears are made not for hearing , but for listening .
Here are two of them .
Reductive listening is listening &quot; for . &quot;
Men typically listen reductively .
That &apos;s the way we talk , right guys ?
Women typically listen expansively .
Noise kills 200,000 people a year in Europe .
It &apos;s a really big problem .
It looks a bit like this .
The second problem that comes with headphone abuse is compression .
Listen to this -- this is an uncompressed piece of music .
There is a cost of compression .
You &apos;re having to imagine it .
It &apos;s not good for you in the long run .
We may be raising an entire generation of deaf people .
Now that &apos;s a really serious problem .
Protect your ears in that way .
Silence is beautiful .
The Elizabethans described language as decorated silence .
Have a foreground , a background , all in beautiful proportion .
It &apos;s fun to get into designing with sound .
Sound healing is a wonderful modality .
It &apos;s been around for thousands of years .
I do urge you to explore this .
Devotional music , good -- Mozart , good .
First of all , listen consciously .
Musicians have bigger brains -- it &apos;s true .
You can do this in groups as well .
Protect your ears ? Yes , absolutely .
So I urge you to take that path .
I wish you sound health .
Eben Bayer : Are mushrooms the new plastic ?
Not like that .
And this isn &apos;t just found in packaging .
And that &apos;s not the only place it &apos;s found .
They &apos;re not biologically compatible .
They &apos;re basically fouling up Earth &apos;s respiratory and circulatory systems .
You &apos;ll find it inside of you .
The first is feedstocks .
This is crazy .
But nature provides us with a really good model here .
And this gets us back to the mushrooms .
Because in nature , mushrooms are the recycling system .
In our process , we basically use it as a glue .
But these materials are grown from agricultural byproducts , not petroleum .
We then process these husks with some basic equipment .
It &apos;s a waste product .
Because the manufacturing process is our organism .
And it &apos;s kind of hard to picture how that happens .
So in front of your eyes , this part just self-assembled .
It actually takes a little longer . It takes five days .
But it &apos;s much faster than conventional farming .
The last step , of course , is application .
In this case , we &apos;ve grown a corner block .
So , why mycelium ?
The first reason is local open feedstocks .
Biological yield is really important .
And I think that can be some really good news .
Thank you .
Nirmalya Kumar : India &apos;s invisible innovation
They laughed . They dismissed us .
You must have gotten your education here . &quot;
It could also be novel ways of organizing firms and industries .
Process innovation is different from product innovation .
You can &apos;t be a professor without having been a student .
India has the youngest growing population in the world .
It gives you a sense of the trend .
Ladies and gentlemen , thank you very much .
Jody Williams : A realistic vision for world peace
I &apos;m actually here to make a challenge to people .
I know there have been many challenges made to people .
Peace is not &quot; Kumbaya , my Lord . &quot;
I think of meditation .
This is called human security .
And I &apos;m trying harder and harder .
Mom , I &apos;m really trying .
We need to redefine what makes us secure in this world .
It is not arming our country to the teeth .
I certainly support the START vote .
In global terms , it &apos;s a little bit of money .
It is saving the tigers .
It is stopping the tar sands .
It is all of those things .
It is using our money for all of those things .
It is about action .
I said , &quot; Yes , Your Holiness .
Your robe gives it away . &quot;
I said , &quot; That &apos;s good . That &apos;s good .
We need that in the world .
I don &apos;t follow that , but that &apos;s cool . &quot;
And he says , &quot; But I have become skeptical .
I think what we need is action . &quot;
But I talked to her for a range of issues .
But I don &apos;t believe in hope without endeavor .
Here &apos;s another woman hero of mine .
She says the airports of the world .
Wangari Maathai -- 2004 Peace laureate .
Working for peace is very creative .
It &apos;s hard work every day .
People could not gather without getting busted and taken to jail .
Working together is what changes our world .
I &apos;ll tell you the quick story .
There was a mother and three children .
The children were killed on the spot .
It was Mairead &apos;s sister .
This is Rigoberta Menchu Tum .
She also received the Peace Prize .
She is now running for president .
That &apos;s what I got stuck doing -- the landmine campaign .
They could maybe volunteer that much .
There were others , like myself , who were full-time .
It &apos;s not a dirty word .
It &apos;s hard work every single day .
Thank you .
Toni Griffin : A new vision for rebuilding Detroit
So we began our process in September of 2010 .
They came to Detroit for a better way of life .
Between 1950 and 2000 , the region grows by 30 percent .
Citywide , there are 80,000 vacant homes .
They can also see vacant property .
Citywide , there are about 100,000 vacant parcels .
So the city is 139 square miles .
So it &apos;s a lot of vacancy .
Three key imperatives were really important to our work .
Thank you .
Anil Ananthaswamy : What it takes to do extreme astrophysics
And that feeling hasn &apos;t left me yet .
And physicists came and started using it sometime in the 1980s .
This is one of the largest underground labs in the world .
And where in the world would you find such water ?
Well the Russians have a tank in their own backyard .
This is Lake Baikal .
This is Lake Baikal in the peak of the Siberian winter .
The lake is entirely frozen .
And they have dedicated their lives to it .
It &apos;s very harsh conditions .
They work on a shoestring budget .
But nonetheless , it &apos;s an extraordinary piece of engineering .
These are four 8.2 meter telescopes .
An extraordinary set of telescopes .
Here &apos;s another view of the same .
Finally , I want to take you to Antarctica .
This is cosmology &apos;s final frontier .
And here we are about to board our bus .
And that &apos;s taking us to McMurdo .
And this is the scene that greets you in McMurdo .
It &apos;s an extraordinary place .
And that process takes about two hours .
The fabric alone weighs two tons .
That &apos;s the kind of dedication these people have .
And I would like to share with you a launch .
This is a close-up of the Buddhist monastery .
And both require silence of some sort .
Thank you .
Steven Johnson : Where good ideas come from
This is the Grand Cafe here in Oxford .
Alcohol was the daytime beverage of choice .
You would be sharper and more alert .
And I think I &apos;ve found a few .
We have this very rich vocabulary to describe moments of inspiration .
I mean , this is what is happening inside your brain .
It &apos;s a new configuration that has never formed before .
So , the technology is there .
These are standard in all the industrialized worlds .
They seem to have the expertise to keep cars working .
And this is what they ended up coming with .
It &apos;s called a &quot; neonurture device . &quot;
In the inside , it &apos;s all car parts .
That &apos;s really where innovation happens .
I mean , this is one vision of it .
This is a statue from Oxford .
Darwin is a great example of this .
That &apos;s in his autobiography .
It will be useful in 2020 .
Could you just give me some time to do that ? &quot;
But that &apos;s a key thing .
And of course , this is nerd heaven , right ?
And these two guys are named Guier and Weiffenbach .
We could probably hear it , if we tune in . &quot;
That &apos;s an interesting idea . &quot;
So they made it really easy to find it .
We should record it . &quot;
That &apos;s pretty cool . &quot;
Could you go the other way ?
So they went back , and they thought about it .
And he said , &quot; Oh , that &apos;s great .
Could you work on that problem ? &quot;
And that &apos;s how GPS was born .
That is how innovation happens .
Chance favors the connected mind .
Thank you very much .
Pattie Maes + Pranav Mistry : Meet the SixthSense interaction
But I would say no .
The system tracks the four significant fingers .
The device is completely portable , and can be ...
So one important difference is that it &apos;s totally mobile .
He can ask for additional information .
Reading the newspaper -- it never has to be outdated .
This is a more controversial one .
And his girlfriend is probably not very happy about him either .
Thank you .
Harald Haas : Wireless data from every light bulb
And these are base stations .
These are cellular mobile phones .
And wireless communications has become a utility like electricity and water .
And one of the issues is capacity .
And radio waves are limited .
And we are simply running out of spectrum .
There &apos;s another problem .
That is efficiency .
And that creates a big problem .
Then there &apos;s another issue that you &apos;re all aware of .
You have to switch off your mobile phone during flights .
In hospitals , they are security issues .
And security is another issue .
These radio waves penetrate through walls .
So these are the main four issues .
And light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum .
X-rays , useful when you go to hospitals .
Then there &apos;s ultraviolet light .
So it &apos;s inherently safe to use .
And guess what ?
14 billion is the number of light bulbs installed already .
So we have the infrastructure there .
Look at the ceiling , you see all these light bulbs .
Go to the main floor , you see these light bulbs .
Can we use them for communications ?
Yes .
What do we need to do ?
An LED is a semiconductor . It &apos;s an electronic device .
And it has a very nice acute property .
So let &apos;s show how we do that .
Not usable for a YouTube video .
But not only that .
What we &apos;ve done is we have also developed a demonstrator .
And what we have here is no ordinary desk lamp .
And then what we have here is a little hole .
And the light goes through that hole .
There &apos;s a receiver .
So what happens when I switch on that light ?
Put your book beneath it and you can read .
It &apos;s illuminating the space .
You &apos;re critical .
You think , &quot; Ha , ha , ha .
But let me do this .
Once again .
Still don &apos;t believe ?
You don &apos;t notice with your human eye .
And the answer is yes .
So I &apos;ve mentioned to you the four challenges .
That &apos;s aside .
And then I &apos;ve mentioned the availability .
You need to see what to do .
You have lights in an aircraft .
So it &apos;s everywhere in a day there is light .
Look around . Everywhere . Look at your smart phone .
It has a flashlight , an LED flashlight .
These are potential sources for high-speed data transmission .
And then there &apos;s security .
And there &apos;s only data where there is light .
So the data goes in that direction , not there anymore .
But I can give you a few examples .
Well you may see the impact already now .
This is a remote operated vehicle beneath the ocean .
And they use light to illuminate space down there .
Traffic lights can communicate to the car and so on .
And every street lamp could be a free access point .
We call it , in fact , a Li-Fi , light-fidelity .
And then we have these aircraft cabins .
Thank you .
Daniel Kraft : A better way to harvest bone marrow
So actually how do we harvest this bone marrow ?
About 200 times usually .
And there is probably a better way to do this .
This is it .
Our standard see-through patient .
We can do multiple passes through that same entry .
No robots required .
And played around with this a little bit .
And our team members developed this technology .
And eventually we got two large animals , and pig studies .
This device was just FDA approved in the last year .
This was done under local anesthesia , as an outpatient .
You all know about embryonic stem cells .
Thanks .
Marco Tempest : A cyber-magic card trick like no other
You &apos;ve probably all heard of Google &apos;s Project Glass .
So these are my illusion glasses .
They &apos;re a little bigger . They &apos;re a prototype .
Let me show you what I mean .
All right . Very significant mark .
Voice : System ready . Acquiring image .
There are 13 cards in each suit .
MT : There are two colors in a deck of cards .
Make a wish .
Wake up .
Joker : Whoa.MT : Are you ready for your party piece ?
Joker : Presenting my pogo stick.MT : Ah . Watch out .
Joker : Whoa , whoa , whoa , oh !
I &apos;m performing for you .
Whoa .
Well , to this , I just say , no no .
Actually , in German , it &apos;s nein nein .
Voice : Why not ? That &apos;s a very good hand .
The odds of getting it are 4,165 to one .
Digital MT : This is without a question the real thing .
MT : Bye bye .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Nancy Lublin : Texting that saves lives
I think it might be a lifeline .
I can help you with those later .
It might be the only way to communicate with your kids .
And the secret is she opens every single one .
Texting has a 100 percent open rate .
Now the parents are really alarmed .
I promise she read that text .
And this isn &apos;t some suburban iPhone-using teen phenomenon .
Texting actually overindexes for minority and urban youth .
We &apos;re finding it 11 times more powerful than email .
We &apos;ve also found an unintended consequence .
We &apos;ve been getting text messages back like these .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to go to school today .
The boys call me faggot . &quot;
But I just started again an hour ago . &quot;
Or , &quot; He won &apos;t stop raping me .
He told me not to tell anyone .
It &apos;s my dad . Are you there ? &quot;
That last one &apos;s an actual text message that we received .
And yeah , we &apos;re there .
I will not forget the day we got that text message .
Because this isn &apos;t what we do .
We do social change .
It &apos;s fast , it &apos;s pretty private .
It &apos;s real time .
We can help millions of teens with counseling and referrals .
That &apos;s great .
But the thing that really makes this awesome is the data .
I want to prevent this shit from happening .
So think about a cop .
There &apos;s something in New York City .
And then they started crime mapping .
So think about the data from a crisis text line .
Or maybe there &apos;s some anecdotal evidence .
Imagine having real time data on every one of those issues .
You could inform legislation .
You could inform school policy .
What &apos;s going on in your school ? &quot;
Thank you .
Phil Hansen : Embrace the shake
This was the destruction of my dream of becoming an artist .
I was making all these scribble pictures .
I actually didn &apos;t even have a regular pair of scissors .
Embrace the shake .
So the end image was never visible as a physical whole .
It was destroyed before it ever existed .
It did not happen overnight .
And what if I didn &apos;t embrace the shake ?
Thank you .
Kelly McGonigal : How to make stress your friend
Anyone ?
How about a moderate amount of stress ?
Who has experienced a lot of stress ?
Yeah . Me too .
But that is not my confession .
Basically , I &apos;ve turned stress into the enemy .
Okay . Some bad news first .
That is over 20,000 deaths a year .
You can see why this study freaked me out .
It &apos;s called the social stress test .
Now we &apos;re going to all do this together .
It &apos;s going to be fun .
For me .
as fast as you can , starting with 996 .
Go !
Audience : Go faster . Faster please .
You &apos;re going too slow .
Stop . Stop , stop , stop .
That guy made a mistake .
We are going to have to start all over again .
You &apos;re not very good at this , are you ?
Okay , so you get the idea .
That pounding heart is preparing you for action .
If you &apos;re breathing faster , it &apos;s no problem .
It &apos;s getting more oxygen to your brain .
So my goal as a health psychologist has changed .
I no longer want to get rid of your stress .
I want to make you better at stress .
And we just did a little intervention .
Oxytocin is a neuro-hormone .
It fine-tunes your brain &apos;s social instincts .
It primes you to do things that strengthen close relationships .
Oxytocin makes you crave physical contact with your friends and family .
It enhances your empathy .
But here &apos;s what most people don &apos;t understand about oxytocin .
It &apos;s a stress hormone .
Well , oxytocin doesn &apos;t only act on your brain .
It &apos;s a natural anti-inflammatory .
It also helps your blood vessels stay relaxed during stress .
I want to finish by telling you about one more study .
Caring created resilience .
Stress gives us access to our hearts .
Thank you .
This is kind of amazing , what you &apos;re telling us .
Rory Sutherland : Perspective is everything
What you have here is an electronic cigarette .
It &apos;s really , really tiring .
So the power of reframing things cannot be overstated .
And reality isn &apos;t a particularly good guide to human happiness .
And when it nuzzles the button , the electric shock stops .
The other dog doesn &apos;t have the button .
Generally the first dog can be relatively content .
The second dog lapses into complete depression .
It &apos;s an interesting question .
Because they are actually the same thing .
I think psychological value is great to be absolutely honest .
I think that &apos;s true actually .
We didn &apos;t have a framework .
You know my example of the Eurostar .
And I think that &apos;s probably right .
But this does not apply the other way around .
Red traffic lights have a countdown delay .
It &apos;s proven to reduce the accident rate in experiments .
Which isn &apos;t a great idea .
The Koreans , very assiduously , did test both .
It &apos;s an innate thing called goal dilution .
Ayelet Fishbach has written a paper about this .
So we walk out of the shops with one of each .
Don &apos;t give them 24 white pills .
It &apos;s called chunking .
This is a toll crossing in Britain .
Quite often queues happen at the tolls .
Sometimes you get very , very severe queues .
Time means more to some people than others .
And I think understanding that could revolutionize tax policy .
It could revolutionize the public services .
It could really change things quite significantly .
Here &apos;s a guy you all need to study .
And so they &apos;re predominantly interested in psychology .
I think they &apos;re right .
Von Mises completely rejected this distinction .
And he used this following analogy .
Try this quick thought experiment .
And it &apos;s vital we understand this .
The effort to do that almost broke the organization .
That &apos;s pretty good .
And so perception actually is leaky in any case .
Thank you very much .
Elif Shafak : The politics of fiction
I &apos;m a storyteller .
I was born in Strasbourg , France to Turkish parents .
It will dry up inside .
We all do .
We &apos;re born into a certain family , nation , class .
I started writing fiction at the age of eight .
And thus began my life-long passion for writing fiction .
Now one other thing happened around this same time .
My mother became a diplomat .
I also had my first taste of cultural stereotypes there .
I was in Istanbul when the earthquake hit in 1999 .
I started writing fiction in English .
So I feel connected to each language in a different way .
And that gap is very intimidating .
And because God loves her , I did get married .
But instead of settling down , I went to Arizona .
I asked him what he meant by that .
And I also understood that I would keep disappointing him .
He wanted to see the manifestation of my identity .
It was only because of our passports .
A function is attributed to fiction .
It comes from everywhere .
My micro story became a macro issue when I was prosecuted .
It was just a story .
And only the latter is an artist &apos;s responsibility . &quot;
Identity politics divides us . Fiction connects .
One is interested in sweeping generalizations .
The other , in nuances .
One draws boundaries .
The other recognizes no frontiers .
Identity politics is made of solid bricks .
Fiction is flowing water .
Today , stories continue to transcend borders .
Literature has to take us beyond .
But I &apos;m also aware of the danger of fetishizing them .
Like that , my fiction as well .
It &apos;s between buildings .
I &apos;m intrigued by this concept .
We usually distrust those areas that fall in between things .
When I write fiction I cherish elusiveness and changeability .
I like not knowing what will happen 10 pages later .
I like it when my characters surprise me .
I think it was a wonderful paradigm shift .
Perhaps that &apos;s not the right way to start at all .
Thank you .
Naturally 7 : A full-band beatbox
We &apos;re ready to fly ! Thank you very much .
Chris Bliss : Comedy is translation
And it &apos;s a charming read .
So no ego problems .
I don &apos;t need a husband who wants to be . &quot;
And that &apos;s when I discovered comedy .
They were lifted verbatim from Palin &apos;s own remarks .
Here was a Palin impersonator quoting Palin word for word .
The description perfectly captured Edwards &apos; personal vanity .
And guess what ?
His intent is to be funny .
Flight-or-fight releases adrenalin , which throws our walls up sky-high .
Now let me give you an example from my act .
Three things I &apos;ve tried to avoid my entire life .
Have at it you radical bastards . The field is yours .
Why is this remotely controversial ?
You have given birth to an abomination .
Remove it from your household .
Economy of language is another real strong suit of great comedy .
That &apos;s an entire childhood in three words .
People can &apos;t wait to pass along that new great joke .
And this isn &apos;t some new phenomenon of our wired world .
First there were drums and then knock-knock jokes .
And he used to be the USA Today Monday morning guy .
So we started talking about climate change .
You &apos;ve got to love that idea .
And this cartoon hit the bull &apos;s eye .
And it didn &apos;t stop there .
That is a lot of punch for 14 words .
Thank you .
Sheikha Al Mayassa : Globalizing the local , localizing the global
Qatar is no exception to the region .
It &apos;s a very young nation led by young people .
Her answer was quite the contrary .
Not that you do ; I &apos;m just saying .
We know that modernization is happening .
And yes , Qatar wants to be a modern nation .
It &apos;s important for us to grow organically .
And we continuously make the conscious decision to reach that balance .
And therefore tradition becomes more important , not less important .
I &apos;m a representation of that phenomenon .
How does that impact our desert culture ?
And guess what ?
No , I don &apos;t think so .
Art becomes a very important part of our national identity .
You know , art and culture is big business .
Ask me .
Ask the chairpersons and CEOs of Sotheby &apos;s and Christie &apos;s .
Ask Charles Saatchi about great art .
They make a lot of money .
Why else do Greeks demand the return of the Elgin Marbles ?
She does that through important visual forms of photography and film .
Our mission is of cultural integration and independence .
We don &apos;t want their collections .
For me it was a new discovery .
Now visual expression is just one form of culture integration .
Last year we didn &apos;t have one Qatari woman filmmaker .
And this is one of our filmmakers &apos; products .
Who are you playing ?
Girl : Uncle Khaled . Here , put on the headscarf .
Khaled : Why would I want to put it on ?
Girl : Do as you &apos;re told , young girl .
Boy : No , you play mom and I play dad .
Play by yourself then .
Girl : Women ! One word and they get upset .
Useless .
Thank you . Thank you !
It attracted 42,000 people , and we showcased 51 films .
It &apos;s important for two things .
Culture &apos;s a very important tool to bring people together .
We should not underestimate it .
This is a very interesting journey .
Familiarity destroys and trumps fear . Try it .
Ladies and gentlemen , thank you very much . Shokran .
Christopher &quot; moot &quot; Poole &quot; : The case for anonymity online
Tom Green : That &apos;s a 4chan thing .
It &apos;s a video game move from &quot; Star Fox . &quot;
&quot; Star Fox 20 &quot; ?
And it was a Japanese forum and imageboard .
And we &apos;ve gone from one board to 48 boards .
This is what it looks like .
And Rick Astley &apos;s kind of rebirth these past two years ...
There are thousands of memes that come out of the site .
So does a site like this have rules ?
Rule one is you don &apos;t talk about / b / .
Two is you do not talk about / b / .
And I will spare you that slide .
I assure you , it is very true .
It is where a third of all the traffic is going .
So they broke that poll .
And I ended up on top .
I ended up at this really fancy party .
But that &apos;s not what &apos;s interesting about this .
They are still protesting .
Dusty is the name that we &apos;ve given to this cat .
They matched , they found his MySpace .
As I said , it &apos;s raw , it &apos;s unfiltered .
They &apos;re endangered because we &apos;re moving towards social networking .
We &apos;re moving towards persistent identity .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Got a couple questions for you .
Don &apos;t tell .
You &apos;ve had to wrestle with issues like child pornography .
CP : Yes and no .
There are plenty of downsides .
And saying whatever you like , I think , is powerful .
Doing whatever you like is now crossing a line .
But I think it &apos;s important to have these places .
CP : There are , certainly .
CP : Yeah , I posted a thread on Sunday .
And within 24 hours , it had over 12,000 responses .
Love and peace were mentioned .
CP : Cats and dogs were mentioned too .
And that content is all off the board now .
Okay , well .
What &apos;s the commercial picture here ?
The site has adult content on it .
But you still live at home , right ?
CP : I actually moved out recently .
That &apos;s very cool .
The content is not dinner table conversation in the least .
CP : That &apos;s a good question .
Matt Ridley : When ideas have sex
The population explosion was unstoppable .
Global famine was inevitable .
The acid rain was falling on the forests .
The desert was advancing by a mile or two a year .
Lifespan is up by 30 percent in my lifetime .
Child mortality is down by two-thirds .
Per-capita food production is up by a third .
And all this at a time when the population has doubled .
How did we achieve that ?
These are both real objects .
The other is obviously a computer mouse .
Homo erectus made the same tool for 30,000 generations .
There was no progress , no innovation .
It &apos;s an extraordinary phenomenon , but it &apos;s true .
Whereas the object on the right is obsolete after five years .
They &apos;ve all been combined together in this technology .
They &apos;ve come together .
How does evolution do cumulative , combinatorial things ?
Well , it uses sexual reproduction .
One goes extinct for the other to survive .
It &apos;s not confined to its own lineage .
It &apos;s a unique human feature .
No other animal does it .
You can have culture without exchange .
You can have , as it were , asexual culture .
Chimpanzee troops have different cultures in different troops .
There &apos;s no exchange of ideas between them .
And why does exchange raise living standards ?
Well , the answer came from David Ricardo in 1817 .
So Oz is better at both spears and axes than Adam .
He doesn &apos;t need Adam .
He can make his own spears and axes .
So the gains from trade are only going to grow .
Adam and Oz both saved an hour of time .
And the answer is about half a second .
The stone axe was made by someone for himself .
It was self-sufficiency .
We call that poverty these days .
How many other people ?
Tens ? Hundreds ? Thousands ?
You know , I think it &apos;s probably millions .
And that &apos;s the way society works .
That &apos;s what we &apos;ve achieved as a species .
Louis XIV had a lot of people working for him .
He had 498 people to prepare his dinner every night .
There &apos;s no working for each other across the colonies .
That is to say , they specialize with respect to reproduction .
The queen does it all .
In our species , we don &apos;t like doing that .
So when did this habit start ?
But I &apos;ve got no evidence for that .
They were a highly cooperative species .
They were a highly intelligent species .
They were imaginative . They buried their dead .
And so it looks like they probably had linguistic skills .
They were brilliant people . I &apos;m not dissing the Neanderthals .
But there &apos;s no evidence of a sexual division of labor .
There &apos;s no evidence of gathering behavior by females .
It looks like the females were cooperative hunters with the men .
They &apos;re always made from local chert .
Trade is 10 times as old as farming .
And that &apos;s evidence that people have started exchanging between groups .
And that will have led to specialization .
An example is Tasmania .
The Tasmanians were isolated .
But who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
Nobody , literally nobody .
I mean this quite seriously .
The president of the computer mouse company doesn &apos;t know .
He just knows how to run a company .
It &apos;s not the same with language .
It &apos;s completely irrelevant .
So we &apos;ve created something called the collective brain .
We &apos;re just the nodes in the network .
We &apos;re the neurons in this brain .
However , bad things happen .
Thank you .
Honor Harger : A history of the universe in sound
Space , we all know what it looks like .
And indeed , most people associate space with silence .
This is the planet Jupiter .
Well the answer is the science of radio astronomy .
So Thomas Watson wasn &apos;t listening to us .
We didn &apos;t have the technology to transmit .
So what were these strange noises ?
Radio could carry sound without wires .
They turned out to be lightning or sources of electrical power .
Let &apos;s jump ahead again .
It &apos;s 1964 , and we &apos;re back at Bell Labs .
They were really listening to the galaxy in high fidelity .
There was a glitch in their soundtrack .
A mysterious persistent noise was disrupting their research .
There were pigeons roosting in the dish .
But the noise didn &apos;t disappear .
Thanks .
Stewart Brand : The dawn of de-extinction . Are you ready ?
Now , extinction is a different kind of death .
It &apos;s bigger .
Suddenly it wasn &apos;t here at all .
What happened ?
Well , commercial hunting happened .
It was the cheapest source of protein in America .
There &apos;s an upside to the story .
But a lot of other animals weren &apos;t saved .
The Carolina parakeet was a parrot that lit up backyards everywhere .
It was hunted to death for its feathers .
It happened to lots of mammals .
Another keystone species is a famous animal called the European aurochs .
There was sort of a movie made about it recently .
And the aurochs was like the bison .
The extinctions still go on .
There &apos;s an ibex in Spain called the bucardo .
It went extinct in 2000 .
A little bit of film was shot .
Sorrow , anger , mourning .
Don &apos;t mourn . Organize .
George Church thinks you can .
It &apos;s kind of like an evolution machine .
The passenger pigeon has 1.3 billion base pairs in its genome .
It &apos;s called an allele .
Well that &apos;s what happens in normal hybridization anyway .
Genetically , the band-tailed pigeon already is mostly living passenger pigeon .
There &apos;s just some bits that are band-tailed pigeon .
Now , there &apos;s work to do .
You have to figure out exactly what genes matter .
Add them all up and the result won &apos;t be perfect .
So this meeting in Boston led to three things .
We hired him full-time .
De-extinction falls in that category .
Some of these conservation biologists are pretty radical .
Another amazing story came from Alberto Fernández-Arias .
Alberto worked with the bucardo in Spain .
It was the first de-extinction in history .
It was short-lived .
Sometimes interspecies clones have respiration problems .
Cryopreservation pioneer of great depth is Oliver Ryder .
Since it &apos;s so pluripotent , it can become germ plasm .
Real falcons out of slightly doctored chickens .
Ben Novak was the youngest scientist at the meeting .
He showed how all of this can be put together .
So what do you do about that ?
Here &apos;s a couple related examples .
The California condor was down to 22 birds in 1987 .
Everybody thought is was finished .
That technology will be used on de-extincted animals .
Another success story is the mountain gorilla in Central Africa .
In 1981 , Dian Fossey was sure they were going extinct .
There were just 254 left .
That &apos;s how comfortable these wild gorillas are with visitors .
There &apos;s no breeding pairs left .
A bit of cloning , you can get them back .
So where do we go from here ?
These have been private meetings so far .
I think it &apos;s time for the subject to go public .
What do people think about it ?
You know , do you want extinct species back ?
Do you want extinct species back ?
Tinker Bell is going to come fluttering down .
What are they concerned about ?
We &apos;re also going to push ahead with the passenger pigeon .
Thank you .
Thank you .
I &apos;ve got a question .
So , this is an emotional topic . Some people stand .
There &apos;s going to be unintended consequences .
We will get woolly mammoths back .
Thank you so much for presenting . SB : Thank you .
Thank you .
Tan Le : A headset that reads your brainwaves
This actually forms a large part of our decision-making process .
There is no longer any consistency in the surface signals .
The second challenge is the actual device for observing brainwaves .
Now on to the detection algorithms .
Evan . Okay .
He just hangs out . He &apos;s relaxed .
Evan Grant : Let &apos;s do &quot; pull . &quot;
So : one , two , three , go .
Okay .
So once we accept this , the cube is live .
Ah , good job !
That &apos;s really amazing .
This is &quot; disappear . &quot;
Okay . Let &apos;s try that .
Oh , my goodness . He &apos;s just too good .
Let &apos;s try that again .
EG : Losing concentration .
Good job . Good job .
Now blink right to go right .
Now blink left to turn back left .
Now smile to go straight .
TL : We really -- Thank you .
Madeleine Albright : On being a woman and a diplomat
Pat Mitchell : What is the story of this pin ?
Madeleine Albright : This is &quot; Breaking the Glass Ceiling . &quot;
PM : Oh .
That was well chosen , I would say , for TEDWomen .
I &apos;ll tell you what happened .
And so I happened to have a snake pin .
So I wore it when we talked about Iraq .
And then I thought , well this is fun .
So that &apos;s how it all started .
PM : So how large is the collection ?
Pretty big .
It &apos;s now traveling .
PM : So is this a good idea .
But people did pay attention to what clothes I had .
Go out and look like a diplomat . &quot;
and so how did you handle that ?
So it evolved .
But basically I love being a woman .
and &quot; will I really say something intelligent ? &quot;
Only girls are Secretary of State . &quot;
PM : Because in her lifetime -- That would be so .
PM : What a change that is .
Where are we ?
From some people .
I think that they thought that it was a soft issue .
The women in Bosnia were being raped .
Now there are 192 .
PM : Is that &quot; Girl 7 ? &quot; Girl 7 .
And we lobbied on behalf of women &apos;s issues .
If you think that , you &apos;ve forgotten high school .
And it was really terrific .
Because one of the things I think you &apos;ll understand .
And so then Tarja was sitting across the table from me .
More women &apos;s voices at the table ?
More men who believe that the balance is best ?
Thank you for joining us today .
Thank you all . Thanks Pat .
Eric Giler : A demo of wireless electricity
I mean , think about how much we love this .
The other thing is , we love batteries .
So I thought I &apos;d better look it up first .
Wires suck , they really do .
The other thing is , batteries suck too .
And they really , really do .
Do you ever wonder what happens to this stuff ?
40 billion of these things built .
This is what happens .
Think about that .
And nature really does abhor a vacuum .
But inside a standard transformer are two coils of wire .
So how does it work ?
Number one question I get asked .
I mean , people are worried about cellphones being safe .
You know . What about safety ?
It doesn &apos;t radiate .
We live in a magnetic field .
And it &apos;s virtually impossible in nature to make that happen .
Mobile electronics .
Home electronics .
There are industrial applications .
And then finally , electric vehicles .
These electric cars are beautiful .
But who is going to want to plug them in ?
And it actually causes your car to charge safely and efficiently .
Credit cards , robot vacuum cleaners .
You &apos;ve got a coil .
We put one on the back of the television set .
It will cause one to get created on the other side .
So , I &apos;ll plug that in .
It creates a magnetic field here .
It causes one to be created out here .
This is a commercially -- available color television set .
How many people want to hang them on the wall ?
Imagine if you can get rid of it .
The other thing I wanted to talk about was safety .
So , there is nothing going on . I &apos;m okay .
So , I wanted to show you something .
We &apos;re an equal opportunity designer of this sort of thing .
This a Google G1 .
It runs the Android operating system .
I think I heard somebody talk about that before .
It &apos;s odd . It has a battery .
you &apos;re looking at a cellphone powered completely wirelessly .
And I know some of you are Apple aficionados .
And Nokia as well .
But they typically use it to light up the screen .
You never have to worry about plugging these things in again .
And think of what that would do for you .
So , thank you very much .
Rob Dunbar : Discovering ancient climates in oceans and ice
We &apos;ll look at sea level rise .
We &apos;ll look at ocean warming .
What frightens you ? &quot;
for me , it &apos;s ocean acidification .
And this has come onto the stage pretty recently .
So I will spend a little time at the end .
It really wasn &apos;t on the radar screen .
You know , they were marginalized in the negotiation room .
One of the problems is coming up with the right target .
It &apos;s not clear what the target should be .
But there &apos;s not a lot of science behind that number .
Should it be 450 ? Should it be 400 ?
There &apos;s not a lot of science behind that one either .
Now , why is this so complicated ?
There &apos;s all kinds of natural causes of climate change .
There &apos;s air-sea interactions .
Volcanoes eject aerosols into the atmosphere .
That changes our climate .
The ocean contains most of the exchangeable heat on the planet .
And we know the solar output &apos;s not constant through time .
So those are all natural causes of climate change .
Now , we have many ways to study natural variability .
I &apos;ll show you a few examples of this now .
It &apos;s a scientific drilling vessel .
And so that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done with this ship .
This was -- this is south of the Antarctic Circle .
It looks downright tropical there .
Most of the time it looked like this .
We had a waves up to 50 ft .
This was led by Ross Powell and Tim Naish .
It &apos;s the ANDRILL project .
And we drilled in the Ross Sea .
That &apos;s the Ross Sea Ice Shelf on the right there .
This is the part of Antarctica that we worry about .
When that ice melts , sea level rises by six meters .
Here &apos;s the cartoon on the left there .
So it &apos;s the deepest geological bore hole ever drilled .
It took about 10 years to put this project together .
And here &apos;s what we found .
That &apos;s the kind of material in the deep sea .
So we know there &apos;s an ice shelf overhead .
And that alternates with a sediment that looks like this .
This is absolutely beautiful stuff .
And this is in the past four million years .
This was completely unexpected .
Nobody imagined that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet was this dynamic .
What caused it ?
that ice sheet became very dynamic and was very easily melted .
And you know what ?
And it could be larger than that .
Okay , the second story takes place here in Galapagos .
This is from Champion Island .
It &apos;s about a meter tall Pavona clavus colony .
And it &apos;s covered with algae . That &apos;s what happens .
Then there was similar mortality in &apos; 97- &apos; 98 .
We saw no other mass mortality events .
So these events in our recent past really are unique .
Here &apos;s how we sample the corals .
This is actually Easter Island . Look at this monster .
This coral is eight meters tall , right .
And it been growing for about 600 years .
So we have a diamond drill .
The core comes up as these cylindrical tubes of limestone .
So we &apos;ve done that all over the Eastern Pacific .
I &apos;ll take you back here to the Galapagos Islands .
Imagine that .
Each one of those is a year .
And we just count on down to the bottom .
Then their other attribute is that they have this great chemistry .
Their ratio tells us the water temperature .
The coral can take us back hundreds and thousands of years .
Here &apos;s a synthetic diagram .
There &apos;s a whole family of curves here .
We do similar things with ice cores .
We work with tree rings .
This is as messy as it gets .
You can see there &apos;s some signals there .
Some of the records show lower temperatures than others .
Some of them show greater variability .
But they all tell us what the natural variability is .
It was cooling down until about 1900 or so .
And there &apos;s the temperature up there in 2009 .
So I &apos;ll close with a short discussion of ocean acidification .
So , you cannot argue with that .
It has many consequences .
There &apos;s consequences for carbonate organisms .
The main framework material of coral reefs is calcium carbonate .
That material is more soluble in acidic fluid .
But it &apos;s not just the carbonate producers that are affected .
Thank you very much .
John Underkoffler : Pointing to the future of UI
The interface is the OS .
There were no graphics routines . There were no mouse drivers .
So it was a necessity .
Same thing for processor speeds .
So we &apos;ve got that incredible ramp-up .
So we &apos;ve forgotten to invent new interfaces .
So what happens next ? Where do we go from there ?
They don &apos;t understand real world space .
So what happens if you start to explain space to them ?
One thing you might get is something like the Luminous Room .
That &apos;s a digital storage in a physical container .
Has to come back out , whatever you put in .
So you &apos;ve got an interface that has no interface .
Here , the real world merges with the simulation .
And we make the machine meet them half way .
It projects down digital shadows , as you see here .
That &apos;s 8 a.m. shadows .
They get a little shorter at 9 a.m.
There you are , swinging the sun around .
Short shadows at noon and so forth .
And we built up a series of tools like this .
Are you blinding passers by and motorists on the freeways ?
This work is 15 years old .
And the result is sort of gratifyingly perpetual .
So here we have a bunch of stuff , some images .
And it &apos;s fun to fly through Mr. Beckett &apos;s eye .
And you can come back out through the scary orangutan .
And that &apos;s all well and good .
Let &apos;s do something a little more difficult .
Here , we have a whole bunch of disparate images .
We can fly around them .
So navigation is a fundamental issue .
You have to be able to navigate in 3D .
Now we can distribute this stuff in many different ways .
We can organize it this way .
Let &apos;s just come down a bit and fly around .
So that &apos;s a different way to look at stuff .
Here are some selection planes .
So , from there to the world of real work .
There &apos;re a lot of elements .
So here &apos;s a familiar place .
And we &apos;ll bring this back here for a second .
Maybe select a little bit of that .
And bring out this graph .
These are logistics elements that are scattered across the United States .
Well , that doesn &apos;t really cut it anymore .
And we might want to look at these various images .
We might want to ask for some help .
These are unrelated machines , right ?
So the computation is space soluble and network soluble .
So let me get some of these out of the way .
Kevin , can you help ?
All right .
So we have a large number of movies stuck inside here .
And let &apos;s just pick out a few elements .
We can zip through them as a possibility .
We may need more than one .
Yeah , let &apos;s take that one .
And , as well , as of efficacy , agency .
So I will leave you with that . Thank you .
That &apos;s our goal entirely .
I mean it &apos;s been 25 years .
Can there really be only one interface ? There can &apos;t .
You know , how can it work ?
It &apos;ll be built into architecture .
The gloves go away in a matter of months or years .
So this is the inevitability about it .
Well that &apos;s cool .
And I understand what you &apos;re asking .
John , thank you for making science-fiction real .
JU : It &apos;s been a great pleasure .
Thank you to you all .
Caroline Casey : Looking past limits
Do you know what I wanted to be ?
I wanted to be a biker chick .
Because big sisters are always supposed to support their little sisters .
So I used to get my eyes tested just for fun .
I am , and have been since birth , legally blind .
And what the hell does that mean to you ?
I might buy some more time .
Hey .
See this hand ?
Beyond this hand is a world of Vaseline .
And every woman , you are so beautiful .
No special needs schools .
No labels .
No limitations .
My ability and my potential .
And they decided to tell me that I could see .
But very quickly I recovered . It was like that .
And I believed I could do it .
So I rammed through life as only a Casey can do .
And I was an archeologist , and then I broke things .
And then I went to business school .
And you know , disabled people are hugely educated .
And they didn &apos;t even know .
And it &apos;s extraordinary how far belief can take you .
Wonderfully , my eyes decided , enough .
And temporarily , very unexpectedly , they dropped .
And two years in , I really could see very little .
I was 28 years old .
And I simply said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry .
I can &apos;t see , and I need help . &quot;
Asking for help can be incredibly difficult .
And it &apos;s frightening , isn &apos;t it ?
But all that belief had fueled me so long .
Can I tell you , airports are a disaster .
Oh , for the love of God .
And please , any designers out there ?
I always end up in the gents &apos; toilets .
And there &apos;s nothing wrong with my sense of smell .
It &apos;s such a small thing , right ?
But before I got to him , I was so lost .
I had no idea who I was anymore .
God no , it was therapy .
Why are you fighting so hard not to be yourself ?
And do you love what you do , Caroline ? &quot;
To leave would be failure .
And he said , &quot; Do you love it ? &quot;
I couldn &apos;t even speak I was so choked up .
I just was so -- how do I tell him ?
Hardly appropriate at this moment in time .
He thought I was mad enough anyway .
And that door closed .
And my chest ached .
But I did know the game was up .
Really not a very sensible thing to do .
And I went on a run that I know so well .
I always run it perfectly fine .
And there was a rock that I always missed .
And I &apos;d never fallen on it , never .
And I didn &apos;t know what to do .
Because who am I going to be ?
What am I going to be ? &quot;
I had lost my belief .
Look where my belief had brought me to .
I was crumpled .
Do something different . What do you want to be ?
Do something different . What do you want to be ? &quot;
And really slowly , slowly , slowly , it happened .
And it did happen this way .
You don &apos;t get more different than that . &quot;
And nobody can tell me no .
Yes , you can say I can &apos;t be an archeologist .
I know how to be Mowgli .
I &apos;m going to be an elephant handler . &quot;
From global management consultant to elephant handler .
But I knew I would .
And together we would trek a thousand kilometers across India .
But you know , I was believing in the wrong thing .
Six thousand people got to see because of that .
I chucked in my job at Accenture .
It was extraordinary .
That &apos;s what I wanted to do .
It just seemed that it was possible .
Even though I present confident , I was scared .
He said , &quot; Be you . &quot;
And so here I am .
This is me , all of me .
Being absolutely true to yourself is freedom .
And I never needed eyes to see -- never .
I simply needed vision and belief .
I no longer want anybody to be invisible .
We all have to be included .
And stop with the labels , the limiting .
Losing of labels , because we are not jam jars .
We are extraordinary , different , wonderful people .
Thank you .
Sam Richards : A radical experiment in empathy
My students often ask me , &quot; What is sociology ? &quot;
How can I understand those invisible forces ? &quot;
And I say , &quot; Empathy .
Start with empathy .
It all begins with empathy .
Here , I &apos;ll give you an example .
And they got fabulously wealthy in doing so .
And they built beautiful cities all powered on that coal .
This is what I saw .
And then I asked myself the question .
Does this sound familiar ?
And back in China , what do they say in China ?
You can &apos;t expect that . &quot;
And we fight back , and it gets really ugly .
And the Chinese respond in a very ugly way .
And just imagine what you would feel .
And you just feel the anger and you feel the fear .
If you can , that &apos;s empathy -- that &apos;s empathy .
And you &apos;ve got to feel that .
Okay , so that &apos;s the warm up .
That &apos;s the warm up .
Now we &apos;re going to have the real radical experiment .
You want your kids to have a better life .
So you have a sense of what the Americans are thinking .
But really , you just want a better life for yourself .
That &apos;s what you want .
You &apos;re Arab Muslim living in Iraq .
You want a better life for yourself .
So here , let me help you .
It &apos;s because somebody else has a design for your resource .
It &apos;s your resource ; it &apos;s not somebody else &apos;s .
It &apos;s your land ; it &apos;s your resource .
Somebody else has a design for it .
And you know why they have a design ?
You know why they have their eyes set on it ?
And what else do you think about these people ?
The Americans , they &apos;re rich .
And back home , what do you see ?
Poverty , despair , struggle .
Look , you don &apos;t live in a wealthy country .
This is Iraq .
This is what you see .
You see people struggling to get by .
And you feel something about this .
And you feel it ; you see it every day .
It &apos;s part of your life .
And you talk about it with your friends .
You read about it .
That &apos;s odd .
You can &apos;t help but think that .
You talk about it .
It &apos;s in the forefront of your mind always .
You say , &quot; How is that possible ? &quot;
Not a single person in your country has not been touched .
But there &apos;s something else .
And what do you see ? They &apos;re Christians .
They &apos;re Christians .
Why ?
You don &apos;t want Americans to die . Protect our troops .
And you feel something about that -- of course you do .
And they do wonderful things .
You read about it , you hear about it .
They don &apos;t know anything about him , but you do .
You pass it around . You pass his words around .
I mean this is serious . You &apos;re afraid .
Whatever . I don &apos;t know . &quot;
You know what it means .
It &apos;s a holy war against Muslims .
Look , invade , subdue them , take their resources .
If they won &apos;t submit , kill them .
That &apos;s what this is about .
This is frightening .
You feel frightened . Of course you feel frightened .
And the Americans : &quot; Ah , he &apos;s a knucklehead .
They laugh him off . You don &apos;t laugh him off .
&quot; He wants to burn Korans , our holy book .
These Christians , who are these Christians ?
Of course you &apos;re going to think this .
You &apos;ve got to see this -- Bible Boot Camp .
These Christians are nuts .
They &apos;re training their little kids to be soldiers for Jesus .
And go to the website .
It says &quot; U.S. Army &quot; right on it .
And you &apos;re reading this website .
You don &apos;t know that .
For you , this is like all Christians .
It &apos;s all over the Web , Bible Boot Camp .
Isn &apos;t that interesting .
And it scares you , and it frightens you .
So these guys , you see them .
They &apos;re my students , my friends .
That &apos;s what they are to you .
So here .
Of course , you got it wrong .
You &apos;re generalizing . It &apos;s wrong .
You don &apos;t understand the Americans .
It &apos;s not a Christian invasion .
You have it wrong . You &apos;ve missed it .
Of course you don &apos;t . Very few people do .
But some of you do .
And this is a perspective .
So everyone &apos;s back in the room , okay .
Now here comes the radical experiment .
So we &apos;re all back home .
This photo : this woman , man , I feel her .
I feel her .
She &apos;s anybody to me .
So here &apos;s what I want you to do .
Let &apos;s go back to my first example of the Chinese .
So I want you to go there .
And the soldiers are Chinese , and everybody else is Chinese .
As an American , how do you feel about this picture ?
What do you think about that scene ?
Okay , try this . Bring it back .
This is the scene here .
These gentlemen here , they &apos;re insurgents .
And maybe they succeeded . Maybe they succeeded .
Put yourself in the shoes of the Americans who caught them .
Can you feel the rage ?
Can you go there ?
It shouldn &apos;t be that difficult .
You just -- oh , man .
Now , put yourself in their shoes .
Are they brutal killers or patriotic defenders ?
Which one ?
I &apos;m going out to defend your freedom , your lives .
Can you imagine that ?
Can you imagine saying that ?
Can you go there ?
What do you think they &apos;re feeling ?
You see , that &apos;s empathy .
It &apos;s also understanding .
Why would you use this example of all examples ? &quot;
And I say , because ... because .
You &apos;re allowed to hate these people .
Whatever it is , you can go so far .
Step inside of the tiny , little world of somebody else .
And they build a big , complex world .
Everything has changed .
Everything in your life has changed .
And that &apos;s , of course , what this is about .
Attend to other lives , other visions .
Listen to other people , enlighten ourselves .
And now perhaps -- perhaps -- you do too .
Thank you .
Robin Ince : Science versus wonder ?
I do a radio show .
The radio show is called &quot; The Infinite Monkey Cage . &quot;
It &apos;s about science , it &apos;s about rationalism .
We know this because they did an experiment . &quot;
You bring in science , and it ruins the magic . &quot;
That &apos;s what I do .
That is gone .
This is a wonderful thing .
You &apos;ll been engulfed by a red giant . &quot;
That is a wonderful idea .
Now reincarnation , that &apos;s another thing gone -- the afterlife .
But it &apos;s not gone .
Science actually says we will live forever .
Well , there is one proviso .
That is a good thing .
We are all totally recyclable .
This is a wonderful thing .
And that is a wonderful thing there .
Love does not die because of that thing .
Pain doesn &apos;t go away either .
This is a terrible thing , even though I understand pain .
No , I just spit out a tooth .
I have a son . His name is Archie .
Now I know you don &apos;t think that .
Now in many ways , that &apos;s just a survival thing .
That is a wonderful thing .
I &apos;ve done some tests .
You house is in a terrible state .
Your partner is about to return .
You think , what should I do ?
Do nothing .
That &apos;s the strong anthropic principle of vacuuming .
For me , it &apos;s a very , very important thing .
I &apos;m sitting on a train .
I &apos;m sitting on a chair .
That , to me , is an incredible thing .
And do you know what , that might be enough .
I &apos;m glad the universe is pointless .
That &apos;s not the point . &quot;
I can make my own purpose .
You can make your own purpose .
Thank you very much . Goodbye .
Renny Gleeson : 404 , the story of a page not found
The 404 page is that .
It &apos;s that broken experience on the Web .
And it serves you the 404 page .
Because it &apos;s the feeling of a broken relationship .
Yes .
But these things are everywhere .
They &apos;re on sites big , they &apos;re on sites small .
This is a global experience .
A 404 page is not what you &apos;re looking for .
That &apos;s the 404 feeling .
I mean , I &apos;ve heard about that .
Joey !
Crowd : Whoa !
So this turned into a contest .
Dailypath that offers inspiration put inspiration on their 404 page .
Each one of them found this .
It turned into a 24-hour contest .
This is one that commiserates with you .
This is one that blames you .
This is one that I loved .
Thank you .
Amber Case : We are all cyborgs now
So what &apos;s a good definition for cyborg ?
People aren &apos;t supposed to be there .
So let &apos;s look at the concept of traditional anthropology .
They &apos;re clicking on things and staring at screens . &quot;
What does the inside of your computer actually look like ?
And suddenly we have to start to maintain our second self .
And I said , &quot; Great . &quot;
I thought I was very clever .
And I said , &quot; I want to do that . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Well , okay . &quot;
And I want to make a time machine . &quot;
So I started studying anthropology .
Every single browser tab gives you a different type of time .
So we have this thing called ambient intimacy .
And so there are some psychological effects that happen with this .
They &apos;re not just sitting there .
And so this is very important .
It actually looks very organic .
And it &apos;s not that machines are taking over .
So that &apos;s why I study cyborg anthropology .
Thank you .
Diana Nyad : Extreme swimming with the world &apos;s most dangerous jellyfish
How had I spent my valuable time ?
How could this have gone by like lightning ?
And then my mother died at 82 .
And I &apos;m not in the present whatsoever .
It was deep in my imagination .
No one &apos;s ever done it without a shark cage .
It &apos;s daunting .
And I started to train .
I hadn &apos;t swum for 31 years , not a stroke .
It &apos;s a smiling face .
And I put together an expedition .
The navigation is difficult .
It &apos;s tricky .
And there &apos;s dehydration .
And there &apos;s hypothermia .
And there are sharks .
And there are all kinds of problems .
Are your shoulders ready ?
And they were . They were prepared .
No stone left unturned .
Was the mind ready ?
You &apos;re really left alone with your own thoughts .
You save the French for last .
And it &apos;s odd , isn &apos;t it ?
And I couldn &apos;t wait to trip the mind fantastic .
Is there an edge ?
And I knew I could do it .
First of all , you &apos;re going to hit obstacles .
You &apos;re immersed in the liquid .
Your body doesn &apos;t like the saltwater .
And I was on fire -- excruciating , excruciating pain .
Help me ! Somebody help me ! &quot;
And the next thing is paralysis .
Then come convulsions .
He &apos;s stung .
My breath is down to three breaths a minute .
I need help , and I can &apos;t help Diana . &quot;
So that was at eight o &apos;clock at night .
It was like an ICU unit in the water .
They either die or they quickly get to a hospital .
And the next night at dusk , again , wham !
And I gave in to the staged swim .
And I got back in .
And I swam through that night and into the next day .
And at 41 hours , this body couldn &apos;t make it .
And the dream was crushed .
I &apos;ll just swim right through them .
Well there was no grin and bearing this .
And they have these long 30 to 40 to 50-ft. tentacles .
And they do this wrapping .
And they can send the poison into the system .
And a little kid from the back was like this .
&quot; Henry , what &apos;s your question ? &quot;
He said , &quot; That &apos;s what you need .
I finished the swim like this .
I was swimming with this thing on .
That &apos;s how scared of the jellyfish I was .
So now what do I do ?
Because we &apos;ve all had them , haven &apos;t we ?
We &apos;ve all had a heartache .
Yeah .
Thank you .
But that ocean &apos;s still there .
This hope is still alive .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
And so , what after that ?
Are you going to swim the Atlantic ?
No , that &apos;s the last swim .
It &apos;s the only swim I &apos;m interested in .
But I &apos;m ready .
I said , &quot; Nope . I didn &apos;t know . &quot;
And now I &apos;m going to live to 85 .
I have three more years than I thought .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
Live it large . Live it large .
Liza Donnelly : Drawing on humor for change
I was afraid of womanhood .
I &apos;ve learned to be flexible .
Let me explain .
There were plenty of role models all around us .
Now my mother was different .
And I just ate it up .
I was launched as a cartoonist .
We &apos;re told what shape we &apos;re supposed to be in .
We pass it down from generation to generation .
Humor relies on the traditions of a society .
It takes what we know , and it twists it .
Now what if you put together women and humor ?
I think you can get change .
I grew up not far from here in Washington D.C.
It didn &apos;t work .
My parents got divorced , and my sister was arrested .
But I found my place .
I can &apos;t help it . I live here .
Consequently , we have .
We have amazing antennae .
But I feel blessed to be able to work with them .
Thank you .
Jeff Skoll : My journey into movies that matter
You &apos;ve got a cruel sense of humor , TED .
Hollywood has its rivalries , and the Valley has its rivalries .
But I &apos;m actually here today to tell a story .
It &apos;s a world of peace and prosperity and sustainability .
And I think that &apos;s just a horrible thing .
So I set out in a hurry . I studied engineering .
And needless to say , I was right .
But for me , personally , it was a real change .
Bet on good people doing good things . &quot;
And that really resonated with me .
People today we call social entrepreneurs .
And I wondered who was doing these kinds of films today .
And then of course , there was the other adage .
We want them to actually get involved in the issues .
And much to my surprise , they were noticed .
We ended up with 11 Oscar nominations for these films .
I thought it was a 30 to 50 year problem .
We &apos;ve sent 50,000 DVDs to high school teachers in the U.S.
and it &apos;s really changed the debate on global warming .
It was also a pretty good year for this guy .
We now call Al the George Clooney of global warming .
And for Participant , this is just the start .
Everything we do looks at the major issues in the world .
I &apos;ll quickly talk about a few coming up .
It &apos;s been a real honor . Thank you .
Oh , thank you .
Sebastian Wernicke : 1000 TEDTalks , 6 words
There &apos;s currently over a thousand TEDTalks on the TED website .
I think we have a situation here .
How on earth are you going to spread a thousand ideas ?
And I did a little calculation of this .
Here &apos;s my approach to it all .
Isn &apos;t there something shorter ?
The only question is , how short can you get ?
Or &quot; Living in existential vacuum ; it sucks . &quot;
I actually like that one .
We could have been done by lunch here .
I mean ...
So I thought this was quite worthwhile .
So I would end up paying hundreds of dollars .
I would cut my costs by 90 percent .
He always proves us wrong .
They just had some general comment .
There were others , and I found this quite cheeky .
I don &apos;t know any TEDTalk that contains this .
Here are some of my favorites .
So here I was .
It &apos;s a huge list .
Again , there were some misunderstandings .
I mean that &apos;s the essence of it all .
So I had 50 overall summaries done .
Thank you very much .
Underwater astonishments
There &apos;s a flying turkey under a tree .
I &apos;m a geologist by training . But I love that .
And a lot of what goes on inside ...
there &apos;s a fish with glowing eyes , pulsating eyes .
Just absolutely amazing , every single dive .
Tough thing to do .
And the male ... We &apos;re going to see it again .
And there he is , his droopy little eyes up here .
But they can do pretty amazing things , too .
Disappears right into the background .
Positively amazing . Here &apos;s two males fighting .
That &apos;s an amazing thing .
Here &apos;s some algae in the foreground ...
That big brown makes his eyespot very big .
Watch the skin color ; watch the skin texture .
One , two , three .
Theo Jansen : My creations , a new form of life
Theo Jansen is working hard on this evolution .
Evolution has generated many species .
This is the Animaris Currens Ventosa .
I could show you this animal .
Thank you .
In fact , it &apos;s a new invention of the wheel .
It works the same as a wheel .
It &apos;s 3.2 tons .
And this is working on the stored winds in the bottles .
Can I have the feeler here ?
OK . Good .
And it must feel the water of the sea .
And this is the water feeler .
So imagine that the animal is walking towards the sea .
Here , we have the brain of the animal .
It &apos;s a binary step counter .
Thank you .
One of the biggest enemies are the storms .
And the nose is fixed , the whole animal is fixed .
I still have to help them a lot .
Thank you very much , ladies and gentlemen .
JD Schramm : Break the silence for suicide attempt survivors
From all outward appearances , John had everything going for him .
Remarkably -- no , miraculously -- he lived .
And that &apos;s actually where our story begins .
I know John &apos;s story very well because I &apos;m John .
As the Trevor Project says , it gets better .
It gets way better .
It &apos;s a conversation worth having and an idea worth spreading .
Thank you .
Pankaj Ghemawat : Actually , the world isn &apos;t flat
before we think about where we go from here .
So let &apos;s start off with plain old telephone service .
Pick a percentage in your own mind .
The answer turns out to be two percent .
Or let &apos;s turn to people moving across borders .
Again , please pick a percentage .
Turns out to be a little bit higher .
It &apos;s actually about three percent .
What percentage of that was accounted for by foreign direct investment ?
Not quite ten percent .
So clearly , apocalyptically-minded authors have overstated the case .
First of all , there is a suggestion of some error .
Okay .
A couple of different reasons come to mind .
So dearth of data in the debate is one reason .
A second reason has to do with peer pressure .
The perspective was , here is this poor professor .
The answer is probably somewhere between 10 to 15 percent .
Which brings me to my second point .
Think of France and the current debate about immigration .
Bono : The good news on poverty
That &apos;s an Englishman asking an Irishman to be succinct .
So , yeah .
And the Pharaoh replies , &quot; Oh , no .
You , your miserableness , have got to be kidding . &quot;
This time it &apos;s called the Facebook .
Crowds are gathered in Tahrir Square .
So exit the rock star .
Enter the evidence-based activist , the factivist .
Look at what &apos;s been achieved .
Look at the pictures these data sets print .
Wow . Wow .
Seven thousand kids a day . Here &apos;s two of them .
This fantastic news didn &apos;t happen by itself .
Give it up for that .
Halved . Halved .
There &apos;s still work to do .
But it &apos;s heart-stopping . It &apos;s mind-blowing stuff .
This is everything .
Can &apos;t be true , can it ?
We do love a good baseline .
That &apos;s amazing .
So the pride of lions is the proof of concept .
There are all kinds of benefits to this .
How about that ?
And 2028 , 2030 ? It &apos;s just around the corner .
I hope . I &apos;m hoping .
Makes us look really young .
So why aren &apos;t we jumping up and down about this ?
Look at this graph .
And the next one is really beautiful .
It &apos;s called momentum .
So inertia versus momentum .
But you can do something about that .
You can do something about that too .
But there &apos;s a vaccine for that too .
Daylight , you could call it , transparency .
And technology is really turbocharging this .
This is exciting stuff .
Once you have this knowledge , you can &apos;t un-know it .
It &apos;s transformational .
It &apos;s not going to kill you .
In fact , it could save countless lives .
Because as is obvious , factivists have feelings too .
I &apos;m thinking of Wael Ghonim , though .
Wael is right .
Thank you .
Thank you so much .
Jason Fried : Why work doesn &apos;t happen at work
But let &apos;s , sort of , start at the beginning .
And so these companies , they build offices .
It seems like it &apos;s perfectly reasonable to ask that .
Typically you get three different kinds of answers .
So here &apos;s some examples .
You almost never hear someone say the office .
What is that about ?
Why is that ?
Why is that happening ?
That &apos;s what happens at the office .
Then you have something else to do .
I mean , we &apos;ve all been through this .
I was at work .
I sat at my desk . I used my expensive computer .
I used the software they told me to use .
I went to these meetings I was asked to go to .
I did these conference calls . I did all this stuff .
But I didn &apos;t actually do anything .
I just did tasks .
I didn &apos;t actually get meaningful work done .
How about seven hours ?
Six ? Five ? Four ?
Two hours ? One , maybe ?
That &apos;s not really what I mean .
I don &apos;t think anyone would say yes .
And I &apos;m one of these managers .
I understand . I know how this goes .
We all have to improve on this sort of thing .
But oftentimes they &apos;ll cite distractions .
&quot; I can &apos;t let someone work at home .
Because those are voluntary distractions .
You decide when you want to be distracted by the TV .
You decide when you want to turn something on .
So let &apos;s go through a couple of those .
That &apos;s kind of ridiculous . It &apos;s a total decoy .
Those aren &apos;t the real problems in the office .
Those are the real problems in the modern office today .
That &apos;s kind of bad .
It doesn &apos;t work that way .
I don &apos;t care what you &apos;re doing .
What if they &apos;re thinking about something important ?
What if they &apos;re doing important work ?
Because meetings aren &apos;t work .
But meetings also procreate .
You don &apos;t schedule an eight-hour meeting with Outlook .
These things don &apos;t exist outside of the office .
So I have some suggestions to remedy the situation .
I have three suggestions I &apos;ll share with you guys .
I have about three minutes , so that &apos;ll fit perfectly .
We &apos;ve all heard of the casual Friday thing .
I don &apos;t know if people still do that .
But how about &quot; no-talk Thursdays ? &quot;
So just the afternoon , one Thursday .
Just silence , that &apos;s it .
It &apos;s better than a computer .
And maybe , hopefully you can do it more often .
You can quit I.M. ; you can &apos;t hide your manager .
Because work , like sleep , happens in phases .
Just don &apos;t have it .
And you &apos;ll find out that everything will be just fine .
And I think it &apos;ll all pay off in the end .
So thanks for listening .
Dianna Cohen : Tough truths about plastic pollution
And I thought , &quot; Great .
It &apos;s ephemeral just like us . &quot;
It &apos;s plastic pollution .
What is the reality of that ?
So this is a big issue for us .
Whenever possible , refuse single-use and disposable plastics .
Alternatives exist ; some of them are very old-school .
So whenever possible , to choose alternatives to single-use plastics .
Thank you .
Jay Walker : The world &apos;s English mania
Let &apos;s talk about manias .
Manias can be good .
Manias can be alarming .
Or manias can be deadly .
The world has a new mania .
A mania for learning English .
Listen as Chinese students practice their English by screaming it .
Teacher : ... change my life !
Students : I will change my life .
T : I don &apos;t want to let my parents down .
S : I don &apos;t want to let my parents down .
T : Most importantly ... S : Most importantly ...
T : I don &apos;t want to let myself down .
S : I don &apos;t want to let myself down .
Two billion of them .
Students : A t-shirt . A dress .
Why English ? In a single word : Opportunity .
Imagine a student taking a giant test for three full days .
Her score on this one test literally determines her future .
She studies 12 hours a day for three years to prepare .
25 percent of her grade is based on English .
Teacher : Perfect ! Students : Perfect !
T : Perfect ! S : Perfect !
T : I want to speak perfect English .
S : I want to speak perfect English .
T : I want to change my life !
S : I want to change my life !
JW : So is English mania good or bad ?
English is the world &apos;s second language .
Your native language is your life .
The world has other universal languages .
Mathematics is the language of science .
Music is the language of emotions .
And now English is becoming the language of problem-solving .
So English mania is a turning point .
Thank you very much .
Hello , Doha . Hello . Salaam alaikum .
Yeah ? And then a Swedish guy showed me my room .
I said , &quot; Where are the Qataris ? &quot;
&quot; They know . &quot;
And then we sat there for two minutes .
I &apos;m working already . &quot;
Any Lebanese by applause ? Lebanese .
Yeah . The Middle East is going crazy .
Who would have thought ? Oh my gosh .
No . There &apos;s serious issues in the region .
Every country is different and it &apos;s confusing , okay ?
I was in Lebanon , I got used to three .
I &apos;m going to be all right . &quot;
Qataris , you guys do the nose to nose .
I need to rest . &quot;
There &apos;s so much , we laugh , right ?
Maybe like an evil -- like , &quot; Wuhahaha , wuhahaha .
We like to laugh . We like to celebrate life .
Never &quot; Hi , Jack . &quot;
&quot; &#91; Imitating Arabic &#93; -- rainbow ! &quot;
&quot; &#91; Imitating Arabic &#93; -- Tutti Frutti ! &quot;
Thank you very much . Have a good night .
Thank you , TED .
Handspring Puppet Co . : The genius puppetry behind War Horse
AK : The ancestor of the horse .
Okay , we &apos;ll do something with it .
Hahahaha .
So it needed a very articulate front paw .
But , like all puppets , it has other attributes .
AK : Haa haa haaa .
BJ : Breath is really important for us .
BJ : From an actor .
Puppets always have to try to be alive .
And in a way that &apos;s a metaphor for life .
BJ : Okay so .
BJ : His mother was a puppeteer .
I really thought they were so beneath me .
BJ : And here again , you see the same structure .
And he &apos;s controlling the ear movement .
AK : It seemed a lovely idea .
But they agreed to go along with it for a while .
So we began with a test .
So we made a model .
BJ : And the two manipulators are inside .
And we had a crate built for it .
It had to be shipped to London .
BJ : About 40 people .
AK : We were terrified .
It had by no means got the green light yet .
And so the show was given the green light .
Here is the plan .
The horses are completely handmade .
There is very little 20th century technology in them .
And now we would like to introduce you to Joey .
Joey boy , you there ?
Joey .
Joey .
Joey , come here .
No , no , I haven &apos;t got it .
He &apos;s got it ; it &apos;s in his pocket .
BJ : Joey .
AK : Joey , Joey , Joey , Joey .
Come here . Stand here where people can see you .
Move around . Come on .
Here , Craig is working the head .
But he also controls the head directly by using his hand .
Horses &apos; hearing is very important .
It &apos;s almost more important than their eyesight .
He &apos;s working the leg .
Horses are so unpredictable .
The hind legs have got the same action .
AK : You want to say something about the breathing ?
BJ : We had a big challenge with breathing .
AK : Other emotional stuff .
You see the skeletal structure of it .
Again , that was a practical consideration .
It &apos;s three heads making one character .
And plant .
Thank you .
AK : Mikey Brett from Leicestershire .
Thank you . Thank you .
Amy Webb : How I hacked online dating
I don &apos;t understand why this keeps happening .
So I asked everybody in my life what they thought .
You &apos;ve got to date around .
I am constantly swimming in numbers and formulas and charts .
So that wasn &apos;t going to work .
So again , I started doing some math .
Population of Philadelphia : It has 1.5 million people .
That &apos;s only 2.3 percent of the population .
Are the families going to get along ?
What &apos;s the rabbi going to say ?
Are they going to start having children right away ?
So I decided to sign on .
Now , there was one small catch .
But that actually wasn &apos;t the biggest problem .
So I just copied and pasted from my résumé .
I talked a lot about JavaScript .
There was this guy Steve , the I.T. guy .
And listen , I &apos;m a modern woman .
I am totally down with splitting the bill .
But then Steve the I.T. guy didn &apos;t come back .
And that was my entire month &apos;s rent .
And they say to me , &quot; Stop complaining . &quot;
&quot; You &apos;re just being too picky . &quot;
There were just bad for me .
Do you like horror films or romance films ?
I &apos;m not looking for a pen pal .
I &apos;m looking for a husband . Right ?
So there &apos;s a certain amount of superficiality in that data .
So I said fine , I &apos;ve got a new plan .
These things were also important to me but not necessarily deal-breakers .
Well , as it turns out , this worked pretty well .
So I go back online now .
And I thought , I &apos;ve done it !
I &apos;ve cracked the code .
Who are all of the other women on these dating sites ?
I found SmileyGirl1978 .
She listed her job as teacher .
She said she is &quot; silly , nice and friendly . &quot;
She likes to make people laugh &quot; alot . &quot;
So I created 10 fake male profiles .
I didn &apos;t carry on crazy Catfish-style relationships with anybody .
I really was just scraping their data .
But I didn &apos;t want everybody &apos;s data .
So I didn &apos;t reach out to any woman first .
And as it turns out , content matters a lot .
Also , optimistic language matters a lot .
And finally , there were the photos .
All of the women who were popular showed some skin .
I was the most popular person online .
How soon are you going out ? &quot;
He talked in detail about travel .
He made a lot of really interesting cultural references .
It was enough for a date .
In fact , it &apos;s something that you write yourself .
Now , your matzoh balls .
They should be fluffy , not hard . &quot;
And I &apos;ll take her advice on that .
Richard Seymour : How beauty feels
But I felt something .
And it was a physiological response .
Now you probably know the answer to this already .
Remember that ?
I remember it clearly .
I remember sitting there thinking , this is fantastic .
I thought , well what the hell &apos;s that about ?
So I started to ask myself questions about it .
I thought , well that &apos;s not good enough .
And so I did some experiments .
Do you know what it is ? Anyone ?
And this isn &apos;t a think , it &apos;s a feel .
And would you do me a favor ?
I felt a sense of relaxation tempered with anticipation .
I get a sense of anticipation &quot; ?
Now I &apos;m not a neuroscientist .
But it might be .
Everybody likes it , but some like it more than others .
They arrive first .
So how do we make that actually work ?
This is one of the most beautiful things I know .
It &apos;s a plastic bag .
Look at that . What are you feeling about it ?
Is it beautiful ? Is it exciting ?
I &apos;m watching your faces very carefully .
Maybe there &apos;s an innocence to it .
Look at that picture .
Look at the innocence . Look at the beauty in it .
Is it beautiful now ?
Stop . Stop . How do you feel ?
Where are you feeling this ?
I &apos;m feeling it here . I feel it here .
The lady over there is actually crying , by the way .
But what are you doing ?
I watch what people do .
I watch faces .
I watch reactions .
Because I have to know how people react to things .
It &apos;s not a &quot; this is wonderful ! &quot;
That &apos;s not the expression of joy .
There &apos;s something else in that .
There &apos;s something weird happening .
Poignancy is a word I love as a designer .
It isn &apos;t just about nice .
And that &apos;s packed in there as well .
So a lot of it tends to be extrinsic .
It &apos;s mediated by information before the comprehension .
Well it obviously isn &apos;t .
And they found that it was almost exact coincidence .
So it wasn &apos;t about symmetry .
But they &apos;re both different .
I &apos;m not getting it off the eyebrow .
And this is the F1 MV Agusta .
Ahhhh .
It &apos;s masses and masses of layers .
This is just the bit that protrudes into our physical dimension .
It &apos;s something much bigger .
Layer after layer of legend , sport , details that resonate .
So that &apos;s getting me excited .
And I feel that here .
Titanium lacquer on this .
I can &apos;t tell you how wonderful this is .
I &apos;m really getting into this now .
So it disappears .
Why would you do that ?
So it &apos;s more expensive , but it &apos;s wonderful .
Massimo Tamburini .
We have to deal with it .
And so look at her .
I &apos;ve had to make a bit of a compromise there .
No one &apos;s noticed , have they yet ?
Did you see what I did ?
I moved three things by a millimeter .
Pretty ? Yes .
Beautiful ? Maybe lesser .
So that &apos;s okay , isn &apos;t it ?
Another millimeter ?
No one &apos;s going to notice those split lines and changes .
And only a few people can do it .
And a focus group cannot do it .
And a team rarely can do it .
So all hail to that .
It &apos;s a fantastic example , a simple object .
So we &apos;re going to have a little experiment .
Are you ready ? Okay .
It &apos;s not .
Did you think it was modern ? Yes you did .
That blip , that information , shot into you before that .
So is that wrong ?
But you &apos;re a slave of that first flash .
It wins or loses at that point .
And finally , the layer that I love , of knowledge .
Yeah ?
It &apos;s fantastic , isn &apos;t it ?
Look at that . Do you want to see it again ?
That &apos;s how underpaid younger-aged people have to fold your T-shirt .
You didn &apos;t maybe know it .
But how do you feel about it ?
Form follows function ?
Only sometimes . Only sometimes .
Form is function . Form is function .
Thank you very much .
Tom Thum : The orchestra in my mouth
Wassup .
Thank you very much , TEDx .
Look at this , Mom ! I made it !
We start our journey in the central deserts .
India .
China .
Germany .
Party , party , yeah .
TEDx .
I got way too much time on my hands .
All right boys , take it away .
Thank you . Thank you very much .
Lesley Hazleton : On reading the Koran
Now I did have an advantage .
So I read slowly .
But all is not lost in translation .
Or take the infamous verse about killing the unbelievers .
Only God knows the true meaning .
Old-fashioned Orientalism comes into play here .
Not a swelling breast nor a high bosom in sight .
And that number 72 never appears .
There are no 72 virgins in the Koran .
Paradise is quite the opposite .
It &apos;s not virginity ; it &apos;s fecundity .
It &apos;s plenty .
It &apos;s gardens watered by running streams .
Thank you .
Eddi Reader : &quot; What You &apos;ve Got &quot;
Karen Tse : How to stop torture
He was not a political prisoner .
He was a 12-year-old boy who had stolen a bicycle .
And the third is commitment .
Could we do something for these 93 countries ?
But Cambodia is not alone .
I used to think , well is it Cambodia ?
Or is it other countries ?
But it is in so many countries .
It wasn &apos;t a baby , she was three .
A judge would let her out . &quot;
What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
I said , &quot; I &apos;m gonna copy this . &quot;
Prosecutors were perfectly trained .
Because it sounds big .
And there are many reasons why I believe it &apos;s possible .
We need to systematically implement early access to counsel .
Never going to happen . &quot;
But I &apos;m one . I can do something .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Kim Gorgens : Protecting the brain against concussion
Awwww .
I &apos;ll just say , July .
Zzzzzzip for safety .
Water wings -- an inch of water .
So you can get kind of a feel for this .
So my baby , Vander , is eight years old now .
He &apos;s interested in playing football .
He wants to learn how to ride a unicycle .
So why would I worry ?
It &apos;s what I study . It &apos;s what I treat .
And I know that kids get concussed every year .
Let &apos;s take a look .
So a car accident .
Forty miles an hour into a fixed barrier -- 35 Gs .
In case you missed it , we &apos;ll look again .
So look to the right-hand side of the screen .
What would you say ?
How many Gs ?
Close .
Seventy-two .
Would it be crazy to know , 103 Gs .
The average concussive impact is 95 Gs .
Because I know our brains are resilient .
They &apos;re designed to recover from an injury .
But kids are more vulnerable to brain injury .
So how do we guarantee the safety of our kids ?
How can we 100 percent guarantee the safety of our kids ?
Let me tell you what I &apos;ve come up with .
If only .
She &apos;s totally not kidding . &quot;
So in all seriousness , should my kid play football ?
Should your kid play football ? I don &apos;t know .
But I do know there are three things you can do .
The first : study up .
There are some great resources out there .
The CDC has a program , Heads Up .
It &apos;s at CDC.gov.
Heads Up is specific to concussion in kids .
The second is a resource I &apos;m personally really proud of .
It &apos;s a great place to start if you have questions .
The second thing is : speak up .
Speak up also with coaching staff .
Ask about what kind of protective equipment is available .
What &apos;s the budget for protective equipment ?
How old it is ?
Wear a helmet .
So , should Vander play football ?
Thank you .
Ellen &apos; t Hoen : Pool medical patents , save lives
They were not the only ones .
So there was a bit of a conflict there .
So what has this got to do with this ?
He was told that a cure did not exist .
AIDS had become a chronic disease .
In 2002 , they were facing a different battle .
Luckily , those patents did not exist everywhere .
Today , eight million people have access to antiretroviral drugs .
Thirty-four million are infected with HIV .
People who have access to these drugs stop dying .
And there &apos;s something else .
They also stop passing on the virus .
This is fairly recent science that has shown that .
So what &apos;s the problem ?
Well , things have changed .
First of all , the rules have changed .
So what India did is no longer possible .
Second , the practice of patent-holding companies have changed .
It isn &apos;t only the number of drugs that are patented .
There &apos;s something else that can really scare generic manufacturers away .
This shows you a patent landscape .
This is the landscape of one medicine .
Again , deliberate action is needed .
And we did .
In 2010 , UNITAID established the Medicines Patent Pool for HIV .
That can be generic manufacturers .
It can also be not-for-profit drug development agencies , for example .
There is one key difference with the airplane patent pool .
The Medicines Patent Pool is a voluntary mechanism .
They were forced to do so .
That is something that the Medicines Patent Pool cannot do .
Today , Nelson Otwoma is healthy .
He has access to antiretroviral drugs .
His son will soon be 14 years old .
And this is no longer fantasy .
Already , I &apos;ll give you an example .
This has never been done before .
This has never been seen before .
Thank you .
David Deutsch : Chemical scum that dream of distant quasars
Nowadays this idea has a dramatic name : Spaceship Earth .
But that doesn &apos;t prevent them from both being completely false .
And so what does that look like ? Typical .
What does a typical place in the universe look like ?
That &apos;s how big and how dark the universe is .
And that is how un-typical this place is .
So , the laws of physics have this special property .
Now , our environment is inundated with evidence .
Now actually , that &apos;s just another parochial misconception .
So we &apos;re not in a uniquely hospitable place .
And the controversy is global warming .
At the moment , these things are fringe research .
So take two stone tablets , and carve on them .
Thank you .
Cynthia Schneider : The surprising spread of Idol TV
Well , you probably recognize the first person .
It all begins with enjoyment .
We are late to watch &quot; Afghan Star . &quot;
We are running late .
We must go to watch &quot; Afghan Star . &quot;
Cynthia Schneider : These programs are reaching incredibly deeply into society .
People watch it all over the country also in public places .
Contestants also put themselves forward .
This has opened up the door , particularly for women .
And she &apos;s out there .
But actually , just the opposite is happening .
They don &apos;t sing pop songs , they sing Afghan music .
No small thing .
Thank you .
Bastian Schaefer : A 3D-printed jumbo jet ?
What do we know about the future ?
Difficult question , simple answer : nothing .
We cannot predict the future .
What are the main customers of the future ?
These are the future anthropometrics .
These people have different needs .
We want to be treated as individuals .
So we combined these needs with technology &apos;s themes .
How can we bring more natural light into the airplane ?
So this airplane has no windows anymore , for example .
This will be very different in the future .
It will communicate directly with the passenger in its environment .
So let &apos;s compare the old world with the new world .
So this is a bracket of an A380 crew rest compartment .
This here is an equal bracket for the same purpose .
It follows the design of bone .
The design process is completely different .
Push this idea a little bit forward .
So how does nature build its components and structures ?
And nature builds large skeletons out of it .
And the same approach can be applied to technology as well .
How this looks in particular , you can show it here .
And you &apos;ve got trillions of them .
So how might the airplane of the future look ?
See you in the future . Thank you .
Adam Garone : Healthier men , one moustache at a time
I think the beautiful Malin &#91; Akerman &#93; put it perfectly .
How did Movember start ?
Why hasn &apos;t that made a comeback ?
So my boss wouldn &apos;t let me go and see clients .
Parents would shuffle kids away from us .
We can &apos;t have anything to do with you . &quot;
So my lesson that year was persistence .
Essentially , I &apos;m a mustache farmer .
And my season is November .
Then in early 2007 , a really interesting thing happened .
Bring this campaign to these countries .
So we thought , why not ? Let &apos;s do it .
I &apos;ve heard this before . I know how it goes .
It wasn &apos;t as successful as we thought it would be .
And for us , we have redefined charity .
Our ribbon is a hairy ribbon .
We hand across our brand and our campaign to those people .
And I said , &quot; Okay , that &apos;s interesting . &quot;
Your mom would be so proud . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Thank you for doing Movember . &quot;
And I said , &quot; What &apos;s your Movember story ? &quot;
So now , that guy is getting screened for prostate cancer .
We fund prostate cancer foundations now in 13 countries .
And that &apos;s how we &apos;re redefining the research world .
My name is Adam Garone , and that &apos;s my story .
Thank you .
Simon Sinek : How great leaders inspire action
For example : Why is Apple so innovative ?
And yet , they &apos;re just a computer company .
They &apos;re just like everyone else .
Then why is it that they seem to have something different ?
Why him ?
There &apos;s something else at play here .
About three and a half years ago I made a discovery .
As it turns out , there &apos;s a pattern .
And it &apos;s the complete opposite to everyone else .
I call it the golden circle .
Why ? How ? What ?
Let me define the terms really quickly .
That &apos;s a result . It &apos;s always a result .
What &apos;s your cause ? What &apos;s your belief ?
Why does your organization exist ?
Why do you get out of bed in the morning ?
And why should anyone care ?
Let me give you an example .
They &apos;re beautifully designed , simple to use and user friendly .
Want to buy one ? &quot; &quot; Meh . &quot;
And that &apos;s how most of us communicate .
But it &apos;s uninspiring .
Here &apos;s how Apple actually communicates .
We believe in thinking differently .
We just happen to make great computers .
Want to buy one ? &quot;
All I did was reverse the order of the information .
In fact , they tried .
They &apos;re eminently qualified to make flat screen TVs .
They &apos;ve been making flat screen monitors for years .
Nobody bought one .
Why would you buy an MP3 player from a computer company ?
But we do it every day .
It &apos;s all grounded in the tenets of biology .
Not psychology , biology .
It just doesn &apos;t drive behavior .
This is where gut decisions come from .
Most people don &apos;t know about Samuel Pierpont Langley .
Everybody was trying it .
Money was no problem .
Then how come we &apos;ve never heard of Samuel Pierpont Langley ?
Samuel Pierpont Langley was different .
He was in pursuit of the result .
He was in pursuit of the riches .
And lo and behold , look what happened .
The others just worked for the paycheck .
We found out about it a few days later .
Well , you can trip over 10 percent of the customers .
That &apos;s how we describe them , right ?
It &apos;s because they wanted to be first .
First , the famous failure .
It &apos;s a commercial example .
Look at TiVo .
They were extremely well-funded .
Market conditions were fantastic .
I mean , we use TiVo as verb .
But TiVo &apos;s a commercial failure .
They &apos;ve never made money .
We don &apos;t need it . We don &apos;t like it .
You &apos;re scaring us . &quot;
How do you do that ?
In fact , some of his ideas were bad .
But he had a gift .
He went around and told people what he believed .
How many of them showed up for him ?
Zero .
They showed up for themselves .
We followed , not for him , but for ourselves .
Listen to politicians now , with their comprehensive 12-point plans .
They &apos;re not inspiring anybody .
Because there are leaders and there are those who lead .
Thank you very much .
Inge Missmahl : Bringing peace to the minds of Afghanistan
Jung in Afghanistan -- you get the picture .
War and malnutrition kills people together with hope .
Yet , there is hope .
So , doctors prescribe medication .
Military collect weapons , and depression stays intact .
Why ?
No one can survive alone .
And very often violence is a way to cope with it .
And partly this is already happening .
But let me repeat the words of the woman .
So the key here is empathy .
Somebody has to feel how you felt .
And somebody has to see you and listen to you .
And I started thinking about a counseling program .
But , of course , I needed help and funds .
At that time , it was the head of Caritas Germany .
Eleven thousand people came -- more than that .
And 70 percent regained their lives .
And they are working with me up to today .
We developed a culturally-sensitive psycho-social counseling approach .
This means , certainly , to retrain all health staff .
We wanted to know if what is being done is effective .
And all the symptoms stayed the same or even got worse .
And I would like to share one short vignette .
So I believe this kept me running .
I thank you for your attention .
Brenda Romero : Gaming for understanding
All these things happen to me .
This is one my partner and I worked on .
So this one here , this is the 1980 Olympics .
And so this was just an amazing experience .
So games , it means something more to us .
It absolutely means something more .
So now , just , this is an abrupt transition here .
And this is one of my favorite shots here .
And this is actually from his Degradation series .
Just imagine if that &apos;s a black guy .
Right ? Like , seriously , nobody would do this .
But every other medium does it .
Pause for about 10 seconds .
&quot; Can I play a game , Mommy ? &quot;
And so I happened to have all of these little pieces .
So she &apos;s painting her little families .
This was the boat . It was made quickly obviously .
Nobody wants to go on the Middle Passage . &quot;
&quot; So Daddy could be gone . &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot;
She got it because she spent time with these people .
And so it was just an incredibly powerful experience .
But when this happened , I saw the whole planet .
My history is Irish .
I made another game called Train .
And I also made a game about the Trail of Tears .
This is a game with 50,000 individual pieces .
It &apos;s the same thing .
I &apos;m hoping that I &apos;ll teach culture through these games .
And originally it was a math problem more or less .
Like , here &apos;s the economics of illegal immigration .
I &apos;ll look away from the picture .
Ann Cooper : What &apos;s wrong with school lunches
These are some of my kids with a salad bar .
Everyone says it couldn &apos;t be done .
How do we really change children &apos;s relationship to food ?
That &apos;s my premise .
We &apos;re seeing sick kids get sicker and sicker .
The way we got here is because of big agribusiness .
And then we talk about organic food .
We can &apos;t keep doing that .
You know , it doesn &apos;t work .
And the results of that are kids getting sick .
One of my big soapboxes right now is antibiotics .
Seventy percent -- it &apos;s unbelievable .
And the result of it is , we have diseases .
And that is what the USDA allows in our food supply .
And that has to change , you know .
We cannot believe that they have our best interests at heart .
The antithesis of this whole thing is sustainable food .
That &apos;s what I really try and get people to understand .
It really is just a new idea .
It &apos;s no wonder , you know , we have criminals .
And what &apos;s happening is , we &apos;re getting sick .
We &apos;re getting sick and our kids are getting sick .
It is about what we feed them .
What goes in is what we are .
We really are what we eat .
What &apos;s going to happen to our whole medical system ?
What &apos;s going to happen ?
And it &apos;s because of what we feed them .
You know , we are responsible for what kids eat .
But oops , maybe they &apos;re responsible for what kids eat .
20 billion dollars a year . 10,000 ads most kids see .
And why can they serve that much ?
Why can we have 29-cent Big Gulps and 99-cent double burgers ?
Which is why I say it &apos;s a social justice issue .
Well , this is the food I found 24 months ago .
This is not even food .
Everything came in plastic , in cardboard .
The only kitchen tools my staff had was a box cutter .
The USDA allows this .
The USDA allows all of this stuff .
But this is what most schools serve .
There &apos;s not a strawberry tree or a carrot bush .
Now , in Berkeley , we &apos;ve gone totally fresh .
We &apos;re cooking from scratch every day .
Those are my hands . I get up at 4 a.m.
They &apos;re not going to be smart .
You know what ? They &apos;re just going to be sick .
And these calendars really started to lay out my program .
So this is a typical menu .
This is what we &apos;re serving this week at the schools .
And you see these recipes on the side ?
They do tastings of these ingredients in the gardening classes .
The really tiny hamburger , the really big vegetables .
We have to start changing this .
What are kids learning ? Where is the family time ?
Where is socialization ? Where is discussion ?
Where is learning to talk ?
You know , we have to change it .
EATWISE -- Enlightened and Aware Teens Who Inspire Smart Eating .
We have recycling in all of our schools .
One of the things I do a lot is public-private partnerships .
Schools are underfunded .
That comes down to under five dollars an hour .
We really need to change it .
It &apos;s going to take more money .
It &apos;s sort of this &quot; duh &quot; thing .
We need to -- we need to educate .
We need to educate the kids .
We need to educate the staff .
I had 90 employees .
Two were supposed to be cooks -- none could .
But we really have to educate .
That is not lunchtime .
That number probably needs to double .
We spend 100 billion dollars a year on diet aids .
200 billion .
You know what ? We should be ashamed .
We , as a country , should be ashamed at that .
The richest country .
We can all make a difference .
Sit down and care .
Thank you .
Fabian Oefner : Psychedelic science
And yet , they do it in a very different way .
Let me demonstrate this based on three projects .
The first one has to do with making sound visible .
So I came up with the following setup .
Let me show you what this looks like .
Thank you very much .
I agree , it looks pretty amazing .
But I have to tell you a funny story .
Has anyone of you heard of ferrofluid ?
Ah , some of you have . Excellent .
Should I skip that part ?
Ferrofluid has a very strange behavior .
It &apos;s a liquid that is completely black .
It &apos;s got an oily consistency .
Those are just standard watercolors that you would paint with .
That &apos;s because the ferrofluid itself is hydrophobic .
That means it doesn &apos;t mix with the water .
So that was the second project .
Now you might ask yourself , how did he do that ?
And at the same time , alcohol is highly flammable .
Let me demonstrate this over here .
And what I have here is an empty glass vessel .
It &apos;s got nothing in it .
Add some more .
And now , let &apos;s set that on fire .
So that &apos;s all that happens .
It goes really fast , and it &apos;s not that impressive .
So that &apos;s how those images were made .
Thank you .
What &apos;s the idea behind it ?
Is it just a waste of whiskey ?
Is it just some strange materials ?
Thank you very much .
James Flynn : Why our IQ levels are higher than our grandparents&apos;
And our minds have altered , too .
Now this has raised all sorts of questions .
Were our immediate ancestors on the verge of mental retardation ?
Because 70 is normally the score for mental retardation .
Or are we on the verge of all being gifted ?
Because 130 is the cutting line for giftedness .
And initially , that archaeologist would be baffled .
How could these performances have escalated to this enormous degree ?
Well we now know , of course , the answer .
And the fellow said , &quot; Absolutely nothing .
A crow can peck at a fish .
A fish can &apos;t do anything to a crow . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Of course not .
One &apos;s a fish .
The other is a bird . &quot;
Hamburg is a city in Germany .
Are there camels in Hamburg ? &quot;
A third interview was conducted with someone about the North Pole .
Wherever there is always snow , the bears are white .
What color are the bears at the North Pole ? &quot;
They weren &apos;t willing to engage in this .
None of these problems are real .
How can we address them ? &quot;
And let me give you a few illustrations .
You can &apos;t do science without proposing hypotheses .
You can &apos;t do science without making it logically consistent .
And even down in grade school , things have changed .
They put it in Albany rather than New York .
They put it in Harrisburg rather than Philadelphia .
And so forth .
So the tenor of education has changed .
What about employment ?
Only three percent were lawyers or doctors or teachers .
A whole range of professions now make cognitive demands .
The professions have been upgraded .
They went far beyond that 1900 banker .
They had to look at computer projections for the housing market .
Or take a farmer today .
But I &apos;ve talked about education and employment .
I &apos;m primarily a moral philosopher .
But he did have a sense that black people were inferior .
they said that is the dumbest thing you &apos;ve ever said .
How would you feel about that ?
They &apos;re just inherited mores .
Would you deserve to be killed ?
That &apos;s not one of the principles I &apos;ve got .
Well you , today , universalize your principles .
You state them as abstractions and you use logic on them .
It must be that blacks are somehow tainted .
Now how did all of this arise out of I.Q. tests ?
That &apos;s what initially got me going on cognitive history .
And in 1900 , people could do simple analogies .
What are dogs like ?
They would say wolves .
They could say a semicircle .
Now , I should say one thing that &apos;s very disheartening .
We haven &apos;t made progress on all fronts .
They live in the bubble of the present .
But I don &apos;t want to end on a pessimistic note .
As if they were a reptile .
Dan Gilbert : Why we make bad decisions
This is what statisticians technically call a damn fine bet .
Now , let me talk about the first one first .
The reason is , this isn &apos;t how people do odds .
So , for example , here &apos;s a word puzzle .
It &apos;s because the mind recalls words by their first letter .
Compare these to the actual numbers .
It &apos;s not interesting because it &apos;s so common .
Drownings and asthma deaths don &apos;t get much coverage .
Why in the world would anybody ever play the lottery ?
There &apos;s 10 tickets in this lottery .
Nine of them have been sold to these individuals .
Well , Bernoulli tells us it is .
Leroy has nine tickets ; there &apos;s one left .
It &apos;s easy to see Leroy getting the check , right ?
I want to talk now about errors in value .
And this is a systematic error people make .
Imagine that you &apos;re going to the theater .
You &apos;re on your way to the theater .
You also have a 20-dollar bill .
Would you spend your remaining money on replacing it ?
Most people answer , no .
Now , let &apos;s just change one thing in this scenario .
When you arrive you discover you &apos;ve lost one of them .
Would you spend your remaining 20 dollars on a ticket ?
Along the way , you lost something .
In both cases , it was a piece of paper .
What the hell difference should it make ?
Suddenly , we &apos;re almost longing for him to return .
The comparison changes how we evaluate him .
So , they will opt for the item in the middle .
Let me just give you an example .
Of course , what happens when they eat the potato chips ?
Most people say they would .
This kind of thinking drives economists crazy , and it should .
It doesn &apos;t know what you saved it on .
You &apos;ve all had this experience .
This is what we call a one-item IQ test , OK ?
Well , by and large people are enormously impatient .
What do we find now ?
What makes this dynamic inconsistency happen ?
Comparison . Troubling comparison . Let me show you .
These guys can tell us .
However , the difference between them seems to be getting smaller .
Here are the results of what I just showed you .
And I want you to see that two things are true .
Watch what happens when we drop some out .
Suddenly we have the dynamic inconsistency that puzzled us .
I &apos;ll take the 50 dollars now .
Thank you .
That was remarkable .
Talk more about it .
It &apos;s out-sized . I mean , look .
If Australia disappears tomorrow , terror is probably the right response .
Is terror the right response ?
What is it ?
That &apos;s not my point at all .
I think in the case of terrorism , it isn &apos;t .
There are no guns going off .
That &apos;s a tough one .
There &apos;s no question .
People died ; so be it .
And so we evolved these responses .
Is that what happened ?
That &apos;s what you think it is . All right ?
It &apos;s not because she is stupid or he is stupid .
Last question .
For you or for them ?
AdG : In persuading them .
Ah , for you in persuading them .
But these are tricks around the margins .
Richard Wilkinson : How economic inequality harms societies
But first , see what a miserable lot we are .
I want to start though with a paradox .
And it makes no difference to their life expectancy at all .
There &apos;s no suggestion of a relationship there .
This , again , is life expectancy .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to show you .
I &apos;m not using any hypothetical data .
We put them all in one index .
They &apos;re all weighted equally .
It &apos;s an extraordinarily close correlation .
It has 40 different components put together by other people .
Everything goes into it .
Here it is in relation to that same measure of inequality .
Kids do worse in the more unequal societies .
Highly significant relationship .
Here , for instance , is trust .
It comes from the World Values Survey .
I may say , we did all this work twice .
Very similar scatter over a similar range of levels of trust .
Same thing is going on .
We &apos;re not just talking about a fluke .
This is mental illness .
And again , closely related to inequality .
This is violence .
But look at the scale of the differences .
It goes from 15 homicides per million up to 150 .
This is the proportion of the population in prison .
But it goes from about 40 to 400 people in prison .
That relationship is not mainly driven by more crime .
In some places , that &apos;s part of it .
Here we have children dropping out of high school .
Again , quite big differences .
This is social mobility .
It &apos;s actually a measure of mobility based on income .
There &apos;s more social mobility .
I &apos;ve shown you just a few things in italics here .
I could have shown a number of other problems .
Think of the expense , the human cost of that .
Japan is rather different though .
It starts off with much smaller differences in earnings before tax .
It has lower taxes .
It has a smaller welfare state .
This is just one example .
It &apos;s infant mortality .
The biggest differences are at the bottom of society .
It also leads to status insecurity .
The social-evaluative judgments increase , the fear of those social-evaluative judgments .
Now we have been criticized .
Otherwise that would introduce bias .
What about other countries ?
Why don &apos;t we control for other factors ?
What about causality ?
Correlation in itself doesn &apos;t prove causality .
We spend a good bit of time .
Thank you .
Andras Forgacs : Leather and meat without killing animals
What &apos;s crazy is what we do today .
But maintaining this herd takes a major toll on our planet .
Animals are not just raw materials .
And we should begin by reimagining leather .
I emphasize leather because it is so widely used .
It is also less polarizing for consumers and regulators .
Now how do we do it ?
This takes millions of cells and expands them into billions .
This collagen is the stuff between cells .
It &apos;s natural connective tissue .
This is real , genuine leather , without the animal sacrifice .
And this leather is 21 layers thick and quite opaque .
What could the future of animal products look like ?
Rather , it could be much more like this .
A brewery is essentially a bioreactor .
It is where cell culture takes place .
Perhaps biofabrication is a natural evolution of manufacturing for mankind .
It &apos;s environmentally responsible , efficient and humane .
It allows us to be creative .
Perhaps we are ready for something literally and figuratively more cultured .
Thank you .
Nick Sears : Demo : The Orb
We can use LEDs .
Most importantly for this , they &apos;re faster .
The equator &apos;s speed is actually about 60 miles per hour .
But this is really just the beginning .
It achieves this by rotating LEDs about two axes .
These blocks represent LEDs .
So , take a look .
But this piece is due out in May .
There are hundreds of student innovators with fantastic projects .
It &apos;s an honor to be here . Thanks very much .
Adam Ostrow : After your final status update
Here &apos;s what he wrote in starting that out .
Consider a few stats for a moment .
There are 200 million Tweets being posted every day .
Adam Ostrow : Hello .
Death : Adam ?
AO : Yeah .
AO : Who is this ?
Death : Go to ifidie.net before it &apos;s too late .
Adam Ostrow : Kind of creepy , right ?
Another service right now is called 1,000 Memories .
But what I think comes next is far more interesting .
Now we &apos;re already starting to see some experiments here .
Thank you very much .
Jehane Noujaim : My wish : A global day of film
And I know what you &apos;re thinking .
She &apos;s not . She &apos;s at the TED Prize .
Wow ! Some of you watched it .
That &apos;s great . That &apos;s great .
This is Donna .
This is Donna at the Statue of Liberty .
This is Donna eating ice cream .
So we &apos;re not forcing people to travel .
So I &apos;m the living product of two cultures coming together .
No pun intended .
And I began to start teaching there .
I taught English , and I met some incredible women there .
So I was 18 ; I was very excited .
And as I sat there , I got very depressed .
And I just saw the power of the image .
And it was incredible .
And so that &apos;s what really kind of started me off .
So I knew that I had to go there .
I just wanted to be in the center .
I had no plan . I had no funding .
I didn &apos;t even have a camera at the time .
I &apos;ve got to go see what this is all about .
Sameer Khader : Business as usual .
Iraq , and then Iraq , and then Iraq .
To change the Arab nightmare into the American dream .
I still have that dream .
Maybe I will never be able to do it .
But I have plans for my children .
I will pay for their study .
And they will stay there .
And it was revolting .
It was absolutely revolting .
It made me sick to my stomach .
That &apos;s bad . &quot;
And then going away , and probably eating dinner or something .
And it didn &apos;t affect me as much .
It makes me hate war .
We had no funding for it .
He kind of redefined us as an American population .
Al Jazeera offered him a job .
And I saw this with audiences .
How do we understand what the other person is thinking ? &quot;
That &apos;s no sacrifice , that &apos;s revenge !
The difference is that the Israeli military is still stronger .
Then let us be equal in death .
We still have Paradise .
There is no Paradise ! It only exists in your head !
God forbid !
May God forgive you .
If you were not Abu Azzam &apos;s daughter ...
In this life , we &apos;re dead anyway .
One only chooses bitterness when the alternative is even bitterer .
And what about us ? The ones who remain ?
Will we win that way ?
Don &apos;t you see what you &apos;re doing is destroying us ?
And that you give Israel an alibi to carry on ?
So with no alibi , Israel will stop ?
Perhaps . We have to turn it into a moral war .
How , if Israel has no morals ?
Be careful !
Ayelet : What do you know about the casualties ?
We &apos;re looking for three girls .
Tzvika : We have no information .
Are you sure she is dead ? &quot;
They said yes .
And my 12-year-old daughter Christine was killed in the shooting .
I am the headmaster for all parts .
George : But there is a teacher that is in charge ?
Tzvika : Yes , I have assistants .
I deal with children all the time .
George : There were many things that touched me .
I know where you guys are coming from .
Death unto apartheid ! &quot;
It &apos;s about the liberation struggle .
Yes . Yes !
Freedom !
And that &apos;s what this is about .
And that &apos;s an amazing thing .
There &apos;s Witness , that you heard from earlier .
And we started calling up everybody .
And we called that landmass Pangea .
And that &apos;s my wish .
That is an incredible wish .
Pangea Cinema -- the day the world comes together .
Ladies and gentlemen , Jehane Noujaim .
Daniel Libeskind : 17 words of architectural inspiration
You see how resistant it is to those very ideas .
We can think them out . We can create incredible things .
We applaud the well-mannered box .
And I think that &apos;s really what architecture is based on .
It &apos;s based on wonder .
But it is a story of effort and struggle against improbabilities .
So , anything that has been made can be unmade .
Anything that has been made can be made better .
These are the dimensions that I like to work with .
It &apos;s something very personal .
And I therefore believe that optimism is what drives architecture forward .
And it is that belief that I think drives society .
Think of the Empire State Building , the Rockefeller Center .
So again , I am a believer in the expressive .
I have never been a fan of the neutral .
I don &apos;t like neutrality in life , in anything .
I think expression .
That &apos;s what expression is .
And , of course , expressive spaces are not mute .
Expressive spaces may disturb us .
And I think that &apos;s also part of life .
So again , radical versus conservative .
It &apos;s not just a conservation in formaldehyde of dead forms .
So again I am a believer in the radical architecture .
You know the Soviet architecture of that building is the conservation .
It &apos;s like the old Las Vegas used to be .
Therefore I believe it should not be cool .
Life without emotion would really not be life .
Even the mind is emotional .
I think that is the progress of cities .
But architecture is not the language of words .
Hand versus the computer .
Of course , what would we be without computers ?
Our whole practice depends on computing .
It is complex . Space is complex .
And yet , our lives are complex .
Our emotions are complex .
Our intellectual desires are complex .
Of course that means that architecture is political .
The political is not an enemy of architecture .
Because architecture is also the asking of questions .
It &apos;s not only the giving of answers .
Therefore it is important that it be real .
You know we can simulate almost anything .
Unexpected versus habitual .
It &apos;s a self-induced poison .
So the unexpected is always unexpected .
And of course habits are enforced by architecture .
We think the world really looks like our buildings .
So again , the unexpected which is also the raw .
And I often think of the raw and the refined .
And of course buildings have their shapes .
Those shapes are difficult to change .
So that is indeed what is memory .
So I believe that my main interest is to memory .
Without memory we would be amnesiacs .
Without the memory there would be no story to tell .
There would be nowhere to turn .
It &apos;s an art of communication .
It can reach into sources that are not explicitly available .
And these are our dreams .
And of course risk . I think architecture should be risky .
World without risk would not be worth living .
It &apos;s about space . It &apos;s not about fashion .
It &apos;s not about decoration .
It &apos;s about carving out a space for trees .
And I think that is really the nature of architecture .
Now I am a believer in democracy .
I don &apos;t like beautiful buildings built for totalitarian regimes .
Where people cannot speak , cannot vote , cannot do anything .
And of course , at Ground Zero what else ?
It &apos;s such a complex project .
It &apos;s emotional . There is so many interests .
There are emotions of the victims .
I think nothing good will come out of that .
I think architecture is about consensus .
And that is where I end .
This is America . This is liberty .
I &apos;ve got a question .
Not just for New York , but for the world .
Thank you so much , Daniel Libeskind .
Ben Cameron : The true power of the performing arts
I have read the &quot; Twilight &quot; tetralogy .
Whatever we do together is pure invention .
How are they entitled to practice ?
Thank you , and godspeed .
Niels Diffrient : Rethinking the way we sit down
Now I &apos;m talking about the &apos; 30s .
And then mount his airplane , maybe for the last time .
But this was real romance to me .
It &apos;s the way I got a part of this romance .
The product was that airplane .
But it built a romance .
Even the parts of the airplane had French names .
Ze fuselage , ze empanage , ze nessal .
You know , from a romance language .
So that it was something that just got into your spirit .
It did mine .
I wanted to build airplanes .
So I built model airplanes .
You couldn &apos;t transfer those to the model itself .
You had to learn about aeronautics .
I &apos;d wile away my time drawing airplanes in the class .
You should be in the art department . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Why ? &quot;
So my romance was temporarily shifted .
And I went into art because they appreciated drawing .
Studied painting ; didn &apos;t do very well at that .
Went through design , some architecture .
Eventually hired myself out as a designer .
And it exists .
And I quit .
I wanted to get back where the romance was .
So I chose furniture .
And I chose chairs specifically because I knew something about them .
But not office chairs .
So I started doing that .
I conceived the kind of airplane .
I basically engineered it .
I built it .
And I flew it .
And that &apos;s the way I work now .
When I started this chair it was not a preconceived notion .
Now that may not mean a lot to some of you .
There are drawbacks to this .
One is : you can &apos;t accommodate everybody .
They begin to fall off the end of your chart .
They will sit in them forever .
He said she had one of the new , better chairs .
She said , &quot; Oh I love it . &quot;
She said , &quot; But it &apos;s too high . &quot;
He came over and looked at it .
And he showed her the lever .
I had one for a wristwatch once . 20 pages .
So I spent a long time .
I said I worked eight or nine years on it .
And they go up easily .
And stop where you want .
You can put them down , essentially out of the way .
No arms at all .
Or you can pull them up where you want them .
You feel that bone under there ?
Just your own .
There &apos;s two of them , one on either side .
And that &apos;s a lot of load .
And breathability is good .
As I recline , my head says more or less vertical .
So that &apos;s where a headrest comes in .
So here we are .
You cant hit your elbow on bottom .
Tom Chatfield : 7 ways games reward the brain
I love video games .
I &apos;m also slightly in awe of them .
That &apos;s about three times the recorded music industry .
And yet , many of these get built .
On the one hand , there &apos;s the wanting processes .
It &apos;s a really great image . It &apos;s pretty cool .
Because it &apos;s very powerful . It &apos;s pretty awesome .
It gives you great powers .
Your ambition is satisfied , but it &apos;s very beautiful .
It &apos;s a very great pleasure to fly around .
And so these combine to form a very intense emotional engagement .
But this isn &apos;t the really interesting stuff .
Because what you can measure in virtuality is everything .
And this allows something very special to happen in games .
It &apos;s something called the reward schedule .
Simple game quest .
I &apos;ve got to keep opening boxes .
Let &apos;s think about probability .
It keeps people engaged .
That would be very boring .
Fifteen is a pretty optimal number .
But we don &apos;t just have pies in the boxes .
There &apos;s 100 percent up here .
But we don &apos;t just do that either .
And each of these rewards is carefully calibrated to the item .
So all this is very powerful .
But we &apos;re in virtuality . These aren &apos;t real boxes .
So we can do some rather amazing things .
They &apos;re not rational about probability .
They think this game is unfair .
Our games don &apos;t always do this .
So what does all this mean in practice ?
So , you give people lots and lots of different tasks .
Third , you reward effort .
It all feeds in as minute reinforcement .
Fourth , feedback .
It &apos;s very hard to learn , to feel a lesson .
And fifth , the element of uncertainty .
The 25 percent . This lights the brain up .
We just want to go back and find out more .
It &apos;s associated with reward-seeking behavior .
And two things really flow from this .
This can all seem very sinister .
The word &quot; addiction &quot; is thrown around .
There are real concerns there .
But the biggest neurological turn-on for people is other people .
This is what really excites us .
They tracked these on a separate website .
And the success rate is at close to 100 percent .
Let &apos;s start with business .
We can break things down into highly calibrated small tasks .
We can use calculated randomness .
We can reward effort consistently as everything fields together .
Thank you very much .
Matthew Childs : 9 life lessons from rock climbing
Most of them are pretty basic .
Number two : hesitation is bad .
Friction climbing doesn &apos;t have any sort of hard positive edges .
You &apos;re climbing on little dimples and nubbins in the rock .
And then from that point on , you &apos;re basically falling .
So momentum is good . Don &apos;t stop .
Rule number three : have a plan .
This climber is on the last pitch of it .
He &apos;s actually right about where I fell .
There is about 1,000 feet of air below him .
And all the hard pitches are actually below him .
And then what happens ?
You get to the last pitch . It &apos;s easy .
And you &apos;re completely flamed out . Don &apos;t do it .
You have to plan ahead to get to the top .
So you &apos;ve got to focus .
You &apos;ve got to keep going .
Rule number five : know how to rest .
This is a climb in the Needles , again in California .
Rule number eight : strength doesn &apos;t always equal success .
And of course there is rule number nine .
So don &apos;t hang on till the bitter end .
Thank you very much .
Jim Fallon : Exploring the mind of a killer
So that &apos;s what I normally do .
And so this would be the typical talk I would give .
So I &apos;ve looked at about 70 of these .
And what came up was a number of pieces of data .
It &apos;s really a very precisely timed thing .
You get different kinds of psychopaths .
They had other sorts of brain damage .
Some of you have this . And it &apos;s sex-linked .
So this is how it &apos;s passed from mother to son .
And it does have some consequences .
Right ? That &apos;s how the mirror neuron system works .
Well what the problem is this tends to concentrate these genes .
And now the boys and the girls get them .
So that was the idea .
She then told me about our own family tree .
Okay , so that &apos;s the first case of matricide .
But it doesn &apos;t stop there .
Okay , now this gives one a little pause .
But more likely is this .
And they all seemed to be OK .
But our grandkids are going to be kind of concerned here .
They have the same brain , and the same EEG .
And now they are close as can be .
But there &apos;s gonna be bad news somewhere .
So that &apos;s my talk .
Robert Gordon : The death of innovation , the end of growth
That &apos;s how we traveled in the year 1900 .
That &apos;s an open buggy . It doesn &apos;t have heating .
It doesn &apos;t have air conditioning .
That &apos;s a Boeing 707 .
Some of the reasons for this are not really very controversial .
They &apos;re demographics , education , debt and inequality .
They &apos;re powerful enough to cut growth in half .
So we need a lot of innovation to offset this decline .
Now here &apos;s eight centuries of economic growth .
The white line is for the U.K. , and then the U.S.
Then growth gets better and better .
But you know what the actual facts are ?
Negative .
This led to a fantasy .
Well , it &apos;s a matter of arithmetic .
Two-percent growth quadruples your standard of living in 70 years .
That means we &apos;d go from 44,000 to 180,000 .
The first headwind is demographics .
But now it &apos;s turned around .
The next headwind is education .
We have a lot of debt .
All the rest went to the top one percent .
So that brings us down to 0.8 .
And that 0.8 is the big challenge .
Are we going to grow at 0.8 ?
So let &apos;s see what some of those inventions were .
By 1929 , electric light was everywhere .
We had the vertical city , the invention of the elevator .
Central Manhattan became possible .
Electricity was also very helpful in liberating women .
They did it on a scrub board .
Then they had to hang the clothes out to dry .
Then they had to bring them in .
The whole thing took two days out of the seven-day week .
And then we had the electric washing machine .
And by 1950 , they were everywhere .
The bedrooms were cold . They were unheated .
And I &apos;ll just give you a few examples .
Urban environments make people more productive than on the farm .
What about the electronic revolution ?
Here &apos;s an early computer .
It &apos;s amazing . The mainframe computer was invented in 1942 .
But I &apos;m now going to give you an experiment .
You have to choose either option A or option B.
So here we are back to the horse and buggy .
Your challenge is , can you match what we achieved ?
Thank you .
Derek Sivers : How to start a movement
But what he &apos;s doing is so easy to follow .
Now , notice that the leader embraces him as an equal .
Now , there he is calling to his friends .
It takes guts to stand out like that .
And here comes a second follower .
So a movement must be public .
Now we &apos;ve got momentum . This is the tipping point .
Now we &apos;ve got a movement .
And that &apos;s how you make a movement .
But let &apos;s recap some lessons from this .
Okay , but we might have missed the real lesson here .
And what a perfect place to do that , at TED .
Thanks .
Mark Pagel : How language transformed humanity
Languages are genes talking , getting things that they want .
Why not ? I mean , that &apos;s what we do .
Now this may sound arrogant , or even full of hubris .
How do we know this ?
You can follow it through the fossil record .
But by comparison , we can learn .
We can benefit from others &apos; ideas .
We can build on their wisdom .
And all of this because of cumulative cultural adaptation .
Social learning really is visual theft .
And small groups are more prone to accidents and bad luck .
Language evolved to solve the crisis of visual theft .
Now you pursue this guy , gesticulating .
We &apos;ll do that . &quot;
Now the job is done .
And this is exactly what the archeological record shows .
Language really is the most potent trait that has ever evolved .
Language really is the voice of our genes .
Now you might say , well , this is just natural .
As we diverge , our languages are naturally going to diverge .
And he said to me , &quot; Oh no .
They &apos;re far closer together than that . &quot;
And this is also true of some remote oceanic islands .
They slow the flow of technologies .
And they even slow the flow of genes .
This remarkable image is not a map of the world .
In fact , it &apos;s a map of Facebook friendship links .
And they impose a barrier to cooperation .
Now think of the absurdity of this situation .
The European Union employs a permanent staff of about 2,500 translators .
One of them always drives the other extinct .
And we see this in the inexorable march towards standardization .
Thank you .
Matt Ridley : Mark , one question .
Mark Pagel : This is a very good question .
But that doesn &apos;t tell us they necessarily had language .
MR : Thank you very much indeed .
Chris Jordan : Turning powerful stats into art
And that &apos;s what I look at with my photographic work .
They just don &apos;t do that in that industry .
That &apos;s 15 minutes of our cup consumption .
And there &apos;s an hour &apos;s worth of our cups .
And there &apos;s a day &apos;s worth of our cups .
You can still see the little people way down there .
And I wanted to show the number .
The number is 2.3 million Americans were incarcerated in 2005 .
And this particular one is about cigarette addiction .
And do you remember the response ?
It will be something that we talk about in 100 years .
And every single day since then , 1,100 Americans have died .
And today , 1,100 Americans are dying from cigarette smoking .
And we aren &apos;t talking about it -- we dismiss it .
The tobacco lobby , it &apos;s too strong .
We just dismiss it out of our consciousness .
And this is what the next piece is about .
A strange phenomenon .
Now , I want to emphasize that these are just examples .
I &apos;m not holding these out as being the biggest issues .
They &apos;re just examples .
There &apos;s this kind of anesthesia in America at the moment .
They &apos;ve gone missing ; these feelings have gone missing .
We can &apos;t make meaning out of these enormous statistics .
Thank you and good afternoon .
Seth Berkley : HIV and flu -- the vaccine strategy
Do you worry about what is going to kill you ?
Heart disease , cancer , a car accident ?
But what really threatens humanity ?
Are we safer today ?
We can do this .
So , I &apos;m here to trumpet vaccines for you .
Or polio ? How many of you remember the iron lung ?
We don &apos;t see scenes like this anymore because of vaccines .
Why is that ?
Well , here &apos;s the dirty little secret .
We knew they worked through old-fashioned trial and error .
So let &apos;s explore how vaccines work .
So that &apos;s really how vaccines work .
These memory cells immediately deploy the exact weapons needed .
The virus is defeated .
Seth Berkley : Really cool video , isn &apos;t it ?
So let &apos;s take a look at the flu virus .
Now let &apos;s take a look at HIV .
The vaccine effort though is really quite different .
Now , what does this mean ?
So what we &apos;ve got is a situation .
So think of it this way .
And that would create a universal HIV vaccine .
Let me give you another example .
Notice these other , smaller protuberances .
These are largely hidden from the immune system .
So I want you to think back a few months ago .
Vaccines were promised to developing countries .
So what happened ?
So today , we get our flu vaccines from ...
chicken eggs , hundreds of millions of chicken eggs .
Almost nothing has changed .
So , here &apos;s an alarming thought .
What if that wild bird flies by again ?
And the process still takes more than half a year .
So are we better prepared than we were in 1918 ?
With a range of new technologies , we could .
Now think of where this leads us .
New infectious diseases appear or reappear every few years .
Will we be quick enough to react before millions die ?
Luckily , this year &apos;s flu was relatively mild .
No longer does AIDS need to kill two million a year .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Thank you .
So , the science is changing .
So , the challenge is full speed ahead .
You also can use adjuvants , which are chemicals you mix .
And malaria &apos;s even further behind ?
The world needs people like you . Thank you .
SB : Thank you .
Graham Hawkes : A flight through the ocean
We still have one foot in the dark ages .
This is an ocean planet .
So I have one message .
And it &apos;s all a question of perspective .
Well , it &apos;s the relative importance .
It &apos;s a thin film , two-dimensional existence .
The ocean representation would have a depth to it .
That means that us terrestrials occupy a minority .
Because it &apos;s a problem we have .
Okay . Let me criticize this thing .
This is an acryclic sphere .
Also coming up later for criticism are these massive lights .
And this one actually carries two great manipulators .
You notice that Jim Cameron is sitting in a seat .
Now , go into the real atmosphere of this planet .
Most of life on earth is in that inner atmosphere .
Fish do not sit in seats .
They don &apos;t fall over . They don &apos;t fall .
It &apos;s truly a three-dimensional space .
And we &apos;re only just beginning to grasp it .
This is the way we should be going into the oceans .
This is a three-dimensional machine .
OK , this is good stuff .
This is man &apos;s first attempt at flying underwater .
She has twice the wingspan that I do .
There I &apos;m coming ; she sees me .
I put reverse thrust and I try and pull gently down .
I &apos;m trying to do everything very gently .
And this ballet is controlled by this lady here .
She gets about that close and then she pulls away .
This was a fly by wire . It has wings .
She just rolled right away from underneath .
It took 10 years to build .
I just had to go and build another machine .
This is an internal Sony camera . Thank you , Sony .
Now , there she goes , right overhead .
This is a wide-angle camera .
I come back up , not for air .
Okay , can we cut that ? Lights back up please .
It was the fact she was going so slow .
She wanted to dance .
You see the larger wing area here .
So we opened the world &apos;s first flight school .
&quot; I write these stinking license , &quot; which I do .
They &apos;re one of the first subsea aviators .
So we &apos;ve run two flight schools .
We &apos;ve decided we &apos;re just going to let that go .
The other thing is that we &apos;ve got much lower costs .
Thank you .
Sunitha Krishnan : The fight against sex slavery
I &apos;m talking to you about modern-day slavery .
Shaheen &apos;s background I don &apos;t even know .
They are sold in the name of adoption .
They are sold in the name of organ trade .
I work on the issue of commercial sexual exploitation .
And I tell you stories from there .
I was 15 when I was gang-raped by eight men .
I never felt like a victim , then or now .
And that &apos;s what we do to all traffic survivors .
Where does their journey begin ?
You have even the middle class sometimes getting trafficked .
These people are deceived , forced .
99.9 percent of them resist being inducted into prostitution .
Some pay the price for it .
They &apos;re killed ; we don &apos;t even hear about them .
They are voiceless , &#91; unclear &#93; , nameless people .
And we are silent about them .
We think it is easy money .
We think it is shortcut .
We think the person likes to do what she &apos;s doing .
And therefore she starts normalizing this exploitation .
And it &apos;s abnormal to live in a shelter .
It &apos;s abnormal to get rehabilitated .
It &apos;s in that context that I work .
It &apos;s in that context that I rescue children .
Because I had lots of them who were already HIV infected .
One third of the people I rescue are HIV positive .
And for me , I was my greatest experience .
You see a girl here who is trained as a welder .
She earns around 12,000 rupees .
Why welding and why not computers ?
What has been my challenge ?
My challenge has not been the traffickers who beat me up .
I can &apos;t hear from my right ear .
My biggest challenge is society .
It &apos;s you and me .
And there is a long pause .
But it is not nice to bring them to our homes .
There it ends .
That &apos;s my biggest challenge .
They need your compassion .
They need your empathy .
They need , much more than anything else , your acceptance .
Can you break your culture of silence ?
Can you speak to at least two persons about this story ?
Can you just encompass these people too ?
Because they are also a part of us .
They are also part of this world .
They died of AIDS last year .
Thank you .
Yasheng Huang : Does democracy stifle economic growth ?
My topic is economic growth in China and India .
One simple answer is China has Shanghai and India has Mumbai .
Look at the skyline of Shanghai .
This is the Pudong area .
You &apos;re being constrained by the public &apos;s opinion .
Even Prime Minister Manmohan Singh agrees with that view .
You cannot be constrained by the public &apos;s opinion .
Here &apos;s the key question .
Just how important are infrastructures for economic growth ?
This is a key issue .
Country 1 has a systematic advantage over Country 2 in infrastructures .
They must have done better , in terms of economic growth .
And Country 2 is possibly India . &quot;
That &apos;s not too good .
The picture there is Khrushchev .
Telephones , infrastructures do not guarantee you economic growth .
Country 2 , that has fewer telephones , is China .
And Country 2 is China .
This is a very little known fact about the two countries .
Yes , today China has a huge infrastructure advantage over India .
And this is clearly the story of the Chinese economic growth .
Let me look at this question more directly .
Is democracy bad for economic growth ?
Both countries are in Asia .
And which one is a democracy ? &quot;
And it &apos;s very common that we compare India with China .
But the more natural comparison is actually between India and Pakistan .
Those two countries are geographically similar .
They have a complicated , but shared common history .
So why do economists fall in love with authoritarian governments ?
One reason is the East Asian Model .
Korea succeeded , North Korea didn &apos;t .
Taiwan succeeded , China under Mao Zedong didn &apos;t .
Burma didn &apos;t succeed .
The Philippines didn &apos;t succeed .
So exactly why did China grow so much faster ?
China was during the Cultural Revolution .
So that &apos;s when China was mad .
The whole country went mad .
And this is the earliest data that I can find .
I haven &apos;t told you about the definition of literacy .
So you have to always think carefully about these decisions .
This is an extremely strange fact .
So India is reverting to the normal .
In China , it &apos;s all women .
Then the issue is , what about the Chinese political system ?
What about the political system ?
Actually , the answer is more nuanced and subtle than that .
They have increased the security of proprietors .
And they have increased the security with long-term land leases .
There are also financial reforms in rural China .
There is also a rural entrepreneurial revolution in China .
You can apply exactly the same dynamic perspective on India .
Indira Gandhi declared emergency rule in 1975 .
The Indian government owned and operated all the TV stations .
One reason is they are always comparing India with China .
But China is a superstar in terms of economic growth .
Comparing with a superstar is the wrong benchmark .
This is a very impressive record indeed .
Which country has the growth momentum ?
But I believe that India has the momentum .
It has the improving fundamentals .
Thank you very much .
Yoav Medan : Ultrasound surgery -- healing without cuts
And this is what I &apos;ll tell you about .
So let &apos;s first talk about focused ultrasound .
And I hold in my hand a tissue-mimicking phantom .
It is made out of silicon .
It is transparent , made just for you .
So you see , it &apos;s all intact , completely transparent .
I &apos;ll take you now to the acoustic lab .
You see the phantom within the aquarium .
This is a setup I put in a physics lab .
On the right-hand side , you see an ultrasonic transducer .
Okay , so everything around it is whole and intact .
It &apos;s just a lesion formed inside .
So think about , this is in your brain .
We need to reach a target inside the brain .
We can do it without harming any tissue .
You know all about imaging , right , ultrasound imaging .
And you know also about lithotripsy -- breaking kidney stones .
He failed , so he then invented the gammaknife .
And it makes you ponder why those pioneers failed .
And there was something fundamental that they were missing .
They were missing the vision .
This is an MR suite with a focused ultrasound system .
And I will give you several examples .
So the first one is in the brain .
So I &apos;d like you to meet John .
John is a retired professor of history from Virginia .
So he suffered from essential tremor for many years .
And medication didn &apos;t help him anymore .
And this is his handwriting .
So we put the patient on the MR table .
And the physician will then take a regular MR scan .
And the objective of that ?
This is the sort of general area of the treatment .
It &apos;s a safety boundary around the target .
It &apos;s a target in the thalamus .
The only handwork the physician does here is moving a mouse .
This is the only device he needs in this treatment .
You see the transducer , the light blue .
There &apos;s water in between the skull and the transducer .
And it does this burst of energy .
It elevates the temperature .
We first need to verify that we are on target .
So the first sonication is at lower energy .
This is really a unique capability of the MR.
It is not being used in regular diagnostic imaging .
And you can see the points there on the graph .
The temperature was raised to 43 degrees C temporarily .
This doesn &apos;t cause any damage .
But the point is we are right on target .
This is an immediate relief .
Thank you .
And this is a quote from John after he wrote it .
He said , &quot; Miraculous . &quot;
And you wonder why .
I mean , those people lose their independence .
They are dependent on others .
And John today is fully independent .
He returned to a normal life routine .
Okay , so you can see here the spot .
It &apos;s like three millimeters in the middle of the brain .
There &apos;s no damage outside .
He suffers from no neurodeficit .
There &apos;s no recovery needed , no nothing .
He &apos;s back to his normal life .
Let &apos;s move now to a more painful subject .
Pain is something that can make your life miserable .
And I would like to tell you about PJ .
He had to forgo all the farm activities .
Many patients like that favor radiation therapy .
And his wife actually took him .
They drove like three hours from their farm to the hospital .
So again , this is an immediate relief .
He returned again to his daily routine on the farm .
He rides his tractor .
He rides his horse to their mountain cabin regularly .
And he has been very happy .
Show us some primary cancer .
What can be done there ?
So I have good news and bad news .
And it has been shown actually outside of the U.S.
And doing that in the U.S.
is very painful .
So the first two applications are breast cancer and prostate cancer .
They were the first to be treated by focused ultrasound .
And we have better-than-surgery results in breasts .
But I have a message for the men here .
And this will take time .
This will take two years .
But I have now a message to the ladies .
Women suffer from that disease .
This is Frances .
She was diagnosed with a grapefruit-sized fibroid .
This is a big fibroid .
So she elected to undergo a focused ultrasound procedure in 2008 .
So new life was born .
He can stop the surgery at any moment .
Kirk Citron : And now , the real news
We are drowning in news .
That &apos;s just one source .
That &apos;s the idea behind The Long News .
Or this ?
Or this ?
Really ?
Is this going to matter in 50 or 100 years ?
Okay , that was kind of cool .
Well , let &apos;s take science .
Someday , little robots will go through our bloodstreams fixing things .
That someday is already here if you &apos;re a mouse .
We &apos;re having trouble feeding six billion today .
Britain will starve without genetically modified crops .
What about global politics ?
Makes it a lot easier to put a colony up there .
Tim Jackson : An economic reality check
And hope actually is at the heart of this .
So we &apos;re caught in a kind of trap .
It &apos;s a dilemma , a dilemma of growth .
Now I haven &apos;t got anything against efficiency .
And I think we are a clever species sometimes .
How clever would we have to be ?
It &apos;s around about 770 grams of carbon .
It &apos;s a bit complex , and I apologize for that .
So it looks a little bit like this .
That &apos;s called the circular flow of the economy .
It looks harmless enough .
And what it does essentially is to stimulate further consumption growth .
Joseph Schumpeter called this &quot; the process of creative destruction . &quot;
Status-driven , conspicuous consumption thrives from the language of novelty .
And in the mean time , personal savings absolutely plummeted .
Is this really how people are ?
Is this really how economies behave ? &quot;
The first one is in the crisis itself .
They want to spend less and save more .
&quot; Here they are , the giraffes . &quot;
You can hear the five-year-old mind working .
Goodness knows what they make of the Lake District weather .
What is the objective ?
&quot; What is the objective of the consumer ? &quot;
So who are we ?
Who are these people ?
Are we these novelty-seeking , hedonistic , selfish individuals ?
What we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve created economies .
It isn &apos;t , in fact , about curtailing possibilities .
It is about opening up .
What does all this mean for economics ?
Ecosia is an Internet search engine .
And Ecosia works in pretty much the same way .
And we &apos;re going to do it .
We &apos;re just going to click on Naturejobs.uk.
It &apos;s a different kind of enterprise for a new economy .
Investment has to be a different beast .
It has to be about transition .
It has to be investing in low-carbon technologies and infrastructures .
And of course , this task has material dimensions .
But it &apos;s also clear that prosperity goes beyond this .
And we need that relationship to reflect , to reclaim hope .
What can we offer those people ?
So this is not just a Western post-materialist fantasy .
Ubuntu says , &quot; I am because we are . &quot;
Prosperity is a shared endeavor .
So this is not about standing in the way of development .
It &apos;s not about overthrowing capitalism .
It &apos;s not about trying to change human nature .
Thank you very much .
Can you picture the politicians ever buying into this ?
You &apos;re not making news out of things falling down .
Can I picture politicians doing it ?
Actually , I already am seeing a little bit of it .
But it has to have political leadership .
Kiran Bedi : A police chief with a difference
Now I &apos;m going to give you a story .
Let me begin with my parents .
I &apos;m a product of this visionary mother and father .
They belonged to boys .
We were four girls and no boys .
And my parents were part of a landed property family .
Children don &apos;t choose a school .
They just get the school which parents choose for them .
So this is the foundation time which I got .
I &apos;m the only one who &apos;s left in India .
One , they said , &quot; Life is on an incline .
You either go up , or you come down . &quot;
Out of 100 , 90 are your creation .
They &apos;re good . They &apos;re your creation . Enjoy it .
Ten are nature-sent over which you can &apos;t do a thing .
You can &apos;t do a thing about it .
You &apos;ve got to just respond to the situation .
But that response comes out of those 90 points .
I thought I must tell you this .
Why I said this , is the background .
This is what comes next .
And I redefined policing concepts in India .
I had other options , but I didn &apos;t choose them .
So I &apos;m going to move on .
This is about tough policing , equal policing .
I now went to a prison assignment as a police officer .
Normally police officers don &apos;t want to do prison .
Let &apos;s lock her up . &quot;
Here I got a prison assignment .
Obviously , it was .
And then how did I deal with them ?
I said , &quot; Do you pray ? &quot;
And they didn &apos;t say anything .
I prayed for them , and things started to change .
This is a visual of education inside the prison .
I started this with community support .
Government had no budget .
This was initiated in Delhi prison .
You see one sample of a prisoner teaching a class .
These are hundreds of classes .
I think that &apos;s the bigger change .
It was the beginning of a change .
Teachers were prisoners . Teachers were volunteers .
Books came from donated schoolbooks .
Stationery was donated .
That &apos;s the second landmark .
One , the numbers you &apos;ll never get to see .
Secondly , this concept .
One thousand prisoners who sat in meditation .
And this is what transformed .
You will hear about it , and you will love it .
Let me show you the next slide .
Because crime is a product of a distorted mind .
This worked .
This is a feedback box called a petition box .
This was a magic box .
This was a sensitive box .
Let me wrap it up .
Secondly is about the anti-corruption movement in India .
Friends , you will hear a lot about it .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you very much . Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
Paul Conneally : Digital humanitarianism
The humanitarian model has barely changed since the early 20th century .
Its origins are firmly rooted in the analog age .
And there is a major shift coming on the horizon .
Haiti was a game changer .
Government institutions were completely decapitated , including the presidential palace .
Haiti was something we hadn &apos;t seen before .
But Haiti provided us with something else unprecedented .
Outside Haiti also , things were looking different .
We had basically three requirements .
We wanted to communicate in a two-way form of communication .
We wanted to be able to target specific geographic communities .
And we wanted it to be easy to use .
It has been used to help communities prepare for disasters .
But does it work ?
Some 74 percent of people received the data .
96 percent of them found it useful .
And 73 percent of them shared it .
Technology is transformational .
One illustration of the transformational power of technology is in Kibera .
Kibera is one of Africa &apos;s largest slums .
They have collated crowd-sourced data and rendered the invisible visible .
You can find out about the latest impromptu music session .
You can find out about the latest security incident .
You can find out about places of worship .
You can find out about the health centers .
You can feel the dynamism of this living , breathing community .
And they are giving a voice to themselves .
They are telling their own story , bypassing the official narrative .
SMS is even used to hold herder summits from remote participation .
We need technology as a core organizational principle .
and convert it to humanitarian good .
We now have the tools . We now have the possibilities .
There are no more reasons not to do it .
Thank you very much .
Eric Berlow and Sean Gourley : Mapping ideas worth spreading
And we call that the meme-ome .
So that &apos;s theory , that &apos;s great .
Let &apos;s see how it works in actual practice .
Cameron Russell talking about image and beauty connected over into Europe .
And they &apos;re looking at energy technology and nuclear fusion .
And a few rise to the surface .
There &apos;s a talk about gratitude .
There &apos;s another one about personal health and nutrition .
What &apos;s trending now ? What &apos;s the popular talk now ?
So this is great . It simplifies things .
It &apos;s literally defining a new field .
These are talks that are linking many talks within their discipline .
We used a measure of ecological diversity to get this .
And apparently it smells like bacon .
I wouldn &apos;t know .
SG : So that &apos;s exactly right .
Thank you .
Alison Jackson : An unusual glimpse at celebrity
Momentum was being built .
So people were wondering : was she going to marry Dodi ?
Was she in love with him ?
Was she pregnant ? Did she want his baby ?
Was she pregnant when she died ?
watch her horses . .
And then I was sort of making imagery .
So I &apos;m trying to penetrate that .
Well , here is the image .
Then suddenly , it started to get on front pages .
I was being asked and paid to do front covers .
But then this changed suddenly .
I then started to work for magazines and newspapers .
This was another newspaper image .
They thought it was real .
I explored with actually dressing up as the celebrities myself .
And me as the Queen .
So , all this work is getting shown in art galleries .
Then I made a book .
Stills from the TV series went into this book .
And what is going to happen to the monarchy ?
I &apos;m not really interested in the celebrity themselves .
I &apos;m interested in the perception of the celebrity .
It &apos;s highly commercial .
And Margaret Thatcher visiting Jeffery Archer in jail .
It &apos;s an extremely fast way of getting information .
Thank you .
James Watson : How we discovered DNA
But it slightly bores me .
So early on , I heard of Charles Darwin .
I guess , you know , he was the big hero .
It wasn &apos;t a baseball player ; it was Linus Pauling .
And so I applied to Caltech and they turned me down .
So I had a really quite happy life at Indiana .
You can read it in about two hours .
And -- but then I went to a meeting in Italy .
Most people believed it was proteins .
So there was something universal about the DNA molecule .
And there I met Francis Crick .
So Wilkins said he thought it was the helix .
X-ray diagram , he thought was comparable with the helix .
So we built a three-stranded model .
The people from London came up .
They said it was lousy , and it was .
And basically , I did nothing . And -- except read .
If DNA is that important , Linus will know it .
But there was ones in the literature .
Actually , Linus didn &apos;t look at them that carefully .
I have nothing to do , no qualifications for anything .
And so Bragg said , &quot; Build models . &quot;
Well , of course , I wanted to build models .
She was a crystallographer .
We weren &apos;t the best chemists in the room .
I just put them down like they were in the books .
He said they were wrong .
And we knew we were right .
From nothing to thing .
So we saw how genetic information is carried .
It &apos;s the order of the four bases .
And you copy it by going from strand-separating .
But that &apos;s not the way most scientists think .
Most scientists are really rather dull .
I was decidedly unhappy ; a girl didn &apos;t marry me .
This was taken in Cambridge in September of 1955 .
RNA provides the information for protein .
Well , at that time -- I should go back .
And we use their technique .
So the first disease he looked at is autism .
I mean , big piece at the molecular level .
So this same technique should probably look at all .
It &apos;s a wonderful way to find genes .
And yet , in the controls there were three .
So what &apos;s the meaning of the controls ?
Were they crazy also , and we didn &apos;t know it ?
So it &apos;s , to me , an extraordinarily exciting time .
I thank you .
Conrad Wolfram : Teaching kids real math with computers
We &apos;ve got a real problem with math education right now .
Basically , no one &apos;s very happy .
Those learning it think it &apos;s disconnected , uninteresting and hard .
Those trying to employ them think they don &apos;t know enough .
And teachers are also frustrated .
It &apos;s actually very popular .
You wouldn &apos;t have expected that a few years back .
What &apos;s the point of teaching people math ?
So let &apos;s ask another question .
What is math ?
That &apos;s stage two .
Turn it from that into some answer in a mathematical form .
And of course , math is very powerful at doing that .
And then finally , turn it back to the real world .
Did it answer the question ?
And also verify it -- crucial step .
Now here &apos;s the crazy thing right now .
Math is a much broader subject than calculating .
But in the last few decades that has totally changed .
But that math liberation didn &apos;t get into education yet .
It &apos;s the chore .
That &apos;s an amazing amount of human endeavor .
And I think there are some cases .
For example : mental arithmetic .
I still do a lot of that , mainly for estimating .
People say , &quot; Is such and such true ? &quot;
It &apos;s still quicker to do that and more practical .
It &apos;s a major subject .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s warranted .
So what are the issues people bring up with this ?
Basics of what ?
Are the basics of writing learning how to sharpen a quill ?
I don &apos;t think so .
So there &apos;s another thing that comes up with basics .
My daughter gave me a rather nice anecdote on this .
She enjoys making what she calls &quot; paper laptops . &quot;
Why do you think that was ? &quot;
This one kind of annoys me , I must say .
I don &apos;t think so .
This is just nuts .
All backwards .
Same principles applied -- calculations , harder .
They &apos;ve got hair all over them .
And think of the outside world .
I don &apos;t think so -- quite the opposite .
It &apos;s called programming .
And we open up so many more possibilities .
You can do so many more problems .
We want people who can feel the math instinctively .
That &apos;s what computers allow us to do .
Another thing it allows us to do is reorder the curriculum .
So calculus has traditionally been taught very late .
Why is this ?
This was an example I built for my daughter .
And very , very simple .
And of course , it turns into a circle .
Very simple example .
And you see , this isn &apos;t some dumbed-down model here .
How many years of protection do I need ?
This isn &apos;t some optional extra .
Thanks .
Jay Bradner : Open-source cancer research
The bar is called the Miracle of Science .
The billboards say &quot; Lab Space Available . &quot;
This information is also pretty staggering .
Yet comparatively , we have about a dozen targeted medications .
We didn &apos;t fly him to Boston .
We didn &apos;t sequence his genome .
It &apos;s been known for decades what causes this malignancy .
It &apos;s three proteins -- Ras , Myc and P53 .
There &apos;s no Ras , no Myc , no P53 drug .
And you might fairly ask : why is that ?
It &apos;s a horrible term of trade .
And this is the 21st century .
Now BRD4 is an interesting protein .
It remembers that it &apos;s cancer .
And so we started to work on this problem .
We just started mailing it to our friends .
I have a small lab .
Now this is a very rare cancer , this BRD4-addicted cancer .
They were changing shape .
This got us very excited .
The next step would be to put this molecule into mice .
And every nursing shift we would throw this material out .
And he obliged us .
And every time , we see the same thing .
And so we did just the opposite .
We told people exactly how to make it .
And this was , unfortunately , successful .
You might know that fat has memory .
Nice to be able to demonstrate that for you .
So what next ?
It &apos;s not orally available .
For us , a major and exciting milestone .
I want to leave you with just two ideas .
Yet this information is largely a secret .
Now the business model involves all of you .
This research is funded by the public .
It &apos;s funded by foundations .
Alison Gopnik : What do babies think ?
What is going on in this baby &apos;s mind ?
Let me give you just one example of this .
Now the question is : How could we ask them ?
So how do we actually ask them the question ?
Well it turns out that the secret was broccoli .
I tasted the broccoli . Mmmmm . &quot;
I tasted the crackers . Eww , yuck . &quot;
We did this with 15 and 18 month-old babies .
So there are two really remarkable things about this .
On one side is a New Caledonian crow .
They &apos;re as smart as chimpanzees in some respects .
Whereas the chickens are actually mature within a couple of months .
Well what kind of explanation could we have for this ?
My son is 23 .
All right , why would we see this correlation ?
But real computers are actually getting to be a lot better .
They go out and test it against the evidence .
The evidence makes them change that hypothesis .
This is Reverend Bayes &apos;s notebook .
How could it be that children are doing statistics ?
So the unlikely hypothesis actually has stronger evidence .
Now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
They &apos;re just learning how to count .
Here &apos;s one from Cristine Legare &apos;s lab .
What Cristine did was use our Blicket Detectors .
Boy : How about this ?
Same as the other side .
Boy : This one lighted up , and this one nothing .
AG : Okay , he &apos;s got his experimental notebook out .
Boy : What &apos;s making this light up .
I don &apos;t know .
AG : Every scientist will recognize that expression of despair .
AG : Okay , hypothesis two .
Boy : That &apos;s why .
Oh .
AG : Now this is his next idea .
Not working either .
AG : Okay , that &apos;s a fourth hypothesis .
Boy : It &apos;s lighting up .
So when you put four .
AG : Okay , there &apos;s his fifth hypothesis .
This is actually pretty typical of four year-olds .
And I think just the opposite is true .
Now here &apos;s what we know about how adult consciousness works .
So we have a very focused , purpose-driven kind of attention .
So what &apos;s it like to be a baby ?
Now it &apos;s good to be a grownup .
It &apos;s good to be a grownup .
Eames Demetrios : The design genius of Charles + Ray Eames
And they were a lot of fun .
Is it because Charles and Ray made this film ?
This is the land .
It has many contrasts .
It is rough and it is flat .
In places it is cold .
In some it is hot .
But people live on this land .
Here is something of the way they live .
It was on seven screens and it was 200 feet across .
And it was at the height of the Cold War .
And yet , how did it start ?
So that was just a little snip .
They were always trying things out .
I &apos;m no exception .
But it &apos;s not about them becoming Bono or Tracy Chapman .
And Charles just checking it out there .
This is an unusual installation of airport seating .
And you know some of them would probably be terrible chairs .
And I &apos;m really here to talk about design .
But you know the object is just a pivot .
It &apos;s a pivot between a process and a system .
The design process for Charles and Ray never ended in manufacturing .
It &apos;s not enough to create one .
So I &apos;ve always liked this prototype picture .
You try things out .
This is a relatively famous chair .
Charles and Ray liked this one because it was better .
This is something called a splint .
And they &apos;d been working on furniture before .
This is a house that Charles and Ray designed .
My sister is chasing someone else . It &apos;s not me .
Now look at that plastic chair .
The house is 1949 .
The chair is done in 1949 .
They focused on the need .
They tried to solve the design problem .
It &apos;s kind of a brutal quote .
This is the earlier design of that house .
Here &apos;s a film we &apos;ve been hearing things about .
The &quot; Powers of Ten &quot; is a film they made .
The familiar one on the lower right .
The Eames &apos; film Tops , lower left .
And a lamp that Charles designed for a church .
Which in turn belongs to a local group of galaxies .
Everybody here is coming at it from a different way .
I want to give you one example .
So here is the tiny creature .
Design was not something other .
It was part of the business of life in general .
It was part of the quality of life .
And here is some family pictures .
So we &apos;re going to watch another film .
This is a film , the one called Toys .
Upper left is a film they did on toy trains .
Lower right is a solar do-nothing toy .
Lower left is Day-of-the-Dead toys .
They are often the precursor to bigger things .
And now I &apos;m going to test you .
So can you read it ?
Lucia angel , okay , eye .
Audience : Saw many trains .
Also , what is he doing ? Row , rowed .
Dawn , very good .
Also rode on one . I ...
Citizen Kane , rose -- Audience : Rosebud .
ED : Okay , good .
So you guys did pretty good , cool .
It &apos;s sort of an alternative universe .
It &apos;s kind of a reinterpretation of the landscape .
Those plaques are plaques we &apos;ve been installing around North America .
We &apos;re about to do six in the U.K. next week .
And so we had spelling bees in Paris , Illinois .
Your word is N. Carolina .
Girl : Y-I-N-D-I-A-N-A .
And the town has really embraced it .
We had the spelling bee in conjunction with the Gwomeus Club .
And we could have been born 100,000 years ago .
They have trading cards and all sorts of cool things .
And you &apos;re kind of trapped in the texture of Kymaerica .
The Tahatchabe , the great road building culture .
A guy named Nobu Naga , the so-called Japanese Columbus .
So let &apos;s watch that . Nobody &apos;s ever seen it .
And he made it for the 1939 faculty exhibition .
Silent . We don &apos;t have a track for it yet .
And you try something out .
But here is what &apos;s really great .
Now we &apos;re going to do some movies . &quot;
So we &apos;re going to do the last clip .
So this is Charles &apos; voice .
And then things get to be a little questionable .
There are things like silver-plated thalis .
And there is solid silver thalis .
But you can go beyond that .
And I also want to share this one .
And I really think that &apos;s where we are .
That &apos;s what we all need to do .
I really thank you for your time .
Bill Doyle : Treating cancer with electric fields
And they use low-intensity electric fields to fight cancer .
Let me first address a few popular misconceptions .
And electric fields are not magnetism .
What electric fields are are a field of forces .
Gravity is also a field of forces that act on masses .
We can all picture astronauts in space .
They begin to be attracted towards Earth .
That &apos;s why you &apos;re all in your chairs .
And we can observe this .
This is cultures , identical cultures , of cervical cancer cells .
And we can see them dividing throughout .
The one within the circle manages .
The one up there can &apos;t divide at all .
GBM affects about 10,000 people in the U.S. each year .
It &apos;s a death sentence .
The expected five year survival is less than five percent .
We divided the patients into two groups .
And then the second group received only Tumor Treating Field therapy .
They had no pain , suffered none of the infections .
Robert Dill-Bundi is a famous Swiss cycling champion .
And five years ago , Robert was diagnosed with GBM .
He received the standard treatments .
He received surgery .
He received high dose radiation to the head .
And he received first-line chemotherapy .
He entered our trial .
And here we can see him getting the therapy .
First of all , these electrodes are noninvasive .
There &apos;s none of the tiredness .
There &apos;s no sensation .
It doesn &apos;t interfere with computers or electrical equipment .
This is a therapy that takes time to work .
It &apos;s still there .
I am the happiest , the happiest person in the world .
And every single morning I appreciate life .
Lydia &apos;s a 66 year-old farmer in Switzerland .
She was diagnosed with lung cancer five years ago .
Her cancer continued to grow .
Three years ago , she entered the Novocure lung cancer trial .
She is managing her farm .
She &apos;s interacting with her kids and her grand kids .
Now she can run all of the activities of her farm .
It &apos;s only the beginning .
Thank you .
Yves Rossy : Fly with the Jetman
Yves uses his body to steer the wing .
He &apos;s acting as a human fuselage , so to say .
And that &apos;s quite unique .
When he arches his back , he gains altitude .
There is Yves Rossy .
So our first critical moment , it &apos;s open .
He is down . Is he flying ?
Commentator Two : It looks like he &apos;s stabilized .
He &apos;s starting to make his climb .
He &apos;s out over the channel .
There is Yves Rossy .
There is no turning back now .
He is over the English Channel and underway .
Ladies and gentlemen , an historic flight has begun .
Commentator : There he is .
Yves Rossy has landed in England .
And now he &apos;s in Edinburgh . Yves Rossy .
And his equipment as well .
Yves , welcome . It is quite amazing .
And there were many , many others .
So it &apos;s possible to fly almost like a bird .
What is it &#91; like &#93; to be up there ?
Yves Rossy : It &apos;s fun . It &apos;s fun .
I don &apos;t have feathers .
But I feel like a bird sometimes .
How did you start to become Jetman ?
When you go out of an airplane you are almost naked .
You take a position like that .
And that &apos;s the nearest thing to the dream .
You have no machine around you .
You are just in the element .
It &apos;s very short and only in one direction .
YR : It &apos;s about 300 km per hour before looping .
That means about 190 miles per hour .
And what &apos;s the weight of the equipment you &apos;re carrying ?
I have 55 kilos on my back .
And you &apos;re not piloting ?
There is no handle , no steering nothing ?
And I wanted to keep this freedom of movement .
And it &apos;s really like the kid playing the airplane .
I want to go down like that .
And up I climb , I turn .
It &apos;s really pure flying .
It &apos;s not steering , it &apos;s flight .
YR : Actually , I try to stay just fit .
I don &apos;t do special physical training .
Just , I try to keep my mobility through new activities .
So you have to adapt .
But for example , bikers , they have the same speed .
Describe for me the equipment since you have it here .
So Breitling &apos;s four engines .
YR : Yeah , two-meter span .
Ultrastable profile .
Harness , parachute .
My only instruments are &#91; an &#93; altimeter and time .
I know I have about eight minutes fuel .
So just check before it &apos;s finished .
And yeah , that &apos;s all .
Two parachutes .
And this is my life .
That &apos;s the real important thing about safety .
I thought , okay , I will go out .
But most probably I did something like that .
Something that is not very safe in image .
So the next thing I saw was just blue .
It was the sea .
I have also an audible altimeter .
And then I did open my chute .
I see . Maybe come back here .
This is risky stuff indeed .
People have died trying to do this kind of thing .
I assume you have standards .
YR : Yeah . I have no checklist for that .
Let &apos;s not tell you employer .
YR : No , that &apos;s really two worlds .
Civil aviation is something that we know very well .
We have a hundred years of experience .
And you can adapt really precisely .
With that , I have to adapt to something new .
That means improvise .
So it &apos;s really a play between these two approaches .
So plan B , always a plan B.
In a fighter , you have an ejection seat .
That &apos;s my ejection seat .
It &apos;s well said . It &apos;s well said .
What happens if one of the engines stops ?
YR : I do a roll .
Did you land on the rim , down at the bottom ?
YR : It was down on the bottom .
But it was too stoney and full of cactus on top .
That &apos;s exactly why I asked the question .
YR : And also the currents are quite funny there .
There is big thermal activity , big difference in altitude also .
YR : I have a standard answer .
Have you ever seen tandem birds ?
Perfect answer .
Yves , one last question .
What &apos;s next for you ? What &apos;s next for Jetman ?
YR : First , to instruct a younger guy .
I want to share it , to do formation flights .
So instead of jumping off a plane , yes ?
Really , I go step by step .
It seems a little bit crazy , but it &apos;s not .
And I hope it will be for everybody .
Yves , thank you very much . Yves Rossy .
James B. Glattfelder : Who controls the world ?
But this is different .
This is coming from the heart of finance .
It gets worse .
What &apos;s happening here ? How can this be possible ?
Unfortunately , the answer is yes .
I ended up in physics by accident .
In a nutshell , you can think of physics as follows .
You encode it into equations .
Then predictions can be made and tested .
Despite the success , physics has its limits .
This paradox is what got me interested in complex systems .
These are just a few examples .
So what do we know about complex systems ?
As a result , networks are ideal representations of complex systems .
Where are economic networks ?
This is a surprising and prominent gap in the literature .
Similar data has been around for quite some time .
What we looked at in detail was ownership networks .
So ownership networks reveal the patterns of shareholding relations .
How are they organized ? Are they isolated ?
Are they interconnected ?
And what is the overall distribution of control ?
In other words , who controls the world ?
I think this is an interesting question .
And it has implications for systemic risk .
This is a measure of how vulnerable a system is overall .
This is the TNC network which we analyzed .
And it turns out to be structured as follows .
And we already see signs of organization going on here .
Well , ownership gives voting rights to shareholders .
This is the normal notion of control .
And the network really matters .
You get the idea .
It &apos;s actually not that hard to understand .
Let me explain by giving you this analogy .
So what did we find after computing all this network control ?
They &apos;re mostly financial institutions in the U.S. and the U.K.
And it gets even more extreme .
What should you take home from all of this ?
This means that its structure is probably the result of self-organization .
Our study &quot; is an impression of the moon &apos;s surface .
It &apos;s not a street map . &quot;
And this is slowly starting .
Now there is still a big problem , in my opinion .
But this is just my own personal ideology .
Thank you .
Zainab Salbi : Women , wartime and the dream of peace
It was deep at night .
I do not remember what time it was .
And I kept on staring at it until it disappeared .
This is my story .
I was that girl .
I am another image and vision of another survivor of war .
I am that refugee , and I am that girl .
We only talk about one side of it .
It is actually about silence , the silence of humanity . &quot;
That &apos;s what my mother in Iraq used to tell me .
It &apos;s like dying from inside-out .
We have been only seeing one side of war .
This is the language of sterility .
How casually we treat casualties in the context of this topic .
This is where we conceive of rape and casualties as inevitabilities .
Ninety percent of modern war casualties are civilians .
Seventy-five percent of them are women and children .
How interesting .
How interesting .
These just become numbers that we refer to .
It is a chess game .
Checkmate .
We are missing a completely other side of wars .
That was her fight .
That was her resistance .
And the ones who are keeping that life are women .
There are two sides of war .
We must have a full picture of what that means .
We need to understand peace from a toenail &apos;s perspective .
Not one , but 50 percent .
She got into Women for Women International &apos;s program .
She got a support network .
She learned about her rights .
She was earning 450 dollars . She was doing okay .
She was sending them to school . Have a new home .
I will meet you there .
Let us make this field a much bigger place .
Let us all meet in that field .
Thank you .
Jessica Green : Are we filtering the wrong microbes ?
What determines the types and distributions of microbes indoors ?
And they are brought inside by humans and other creatures .
And we looked at three different types of rooms .
And we also sampled the outdoor air .
But being less diverse is not necessarily good for our health .
And this is because we &apos;re all constantly shedding microbes .
Why does this matter ?
Thank you .
Bill Gates : Teachers need real feedback
Everyone needs a coach .
Sorry , Sharon . Here you go .
We all need people who will give us feedback .
That &apos;s how we improve .
I &apos;m talking about teachers .
How would I know who was the best ?
How would I know what I was doing differently ?
Our teachers deserve better .
The system we have today isn &apos;t fair to them .
Let &apos;s start by asking who &apos;s doing well .
Consider the rankings for reading proficiency .
The U.S. isn &apos;t number one .
We &apos;re not even in the top 10 .
We &apos;re tied for 15th with Iceland and Poland .
Eleven out of 14 .
Some teachers are far more effective than others .
What would that system look like ?
For example , did they ask their students challenging questions ?
Did they find multiple ways to explain an idea ?
&quot; Do you learn to correct your mistakes ? &quot;
And what we found is very exciting .
So it tells us we &apos;re asking the right questions .
Sarah Brown Wessling : Good morning everybody .
Let &apos;s talk about what &apos;s going on today .
My name is Sarah Brown Wessling .
Turn to somebody next to you .
It doesn &apos;t catch every little thing that &apos;s going on .
And I &apos;m able to learn a lot from it .
Alrighty , everybody , have a great weekend .
I &apos;ll see you later .
But we still have more work to do .
Building this system will also require a considerable investment .
The impact for teachers would be phenomenal .
This wouldn &apos;t just make us a more successful country .
I hope you are too .
Thank you .
Pico Iyer : Where is home ?
Where do you come from ?
And if &quot; Where do you come from ? &quot;
means &quot; Where were you born and raised and educated ? &quot;
And if &quot; Where do you come from ? &quot;
means &quot; Where do you pay your taxes ?
Where do you see your doctor and your dentist ? &quot;
I do actually feel more alien the longer I live there .
And if &quot; Where do you come from ? &quot;
Home for them is really a work in progress .
I literally couldn &apos;t point to any physical construction .
Already , we represent the fifth-largest nation on Earth .
You can &apos;t take anything for granted .
Suddenly you &apos;re alert to the secret patterns of the world .
So they become friends . They fall in love .
They move to New York City .
Or Edinburgh .
It &apos;s the place where you become yourself .
This was the wrong answer .
Several lifetimes , actually .
He found himself .
All around me were 800 acres of wild dry brush .
I didn &apos;t consult the monks for guidance .
That &apos;s not the point .
It &apos;s the place where you stand .
Thank you .
Mena Trott : Meet the founder of the blog revolution
But then I started thinking about my family .
So , who am I ?
Chris kind of mentioned I started a company with my husband .
We have about 125 people internationally .
Bloggers exposed this , or they worked hard to expose this .
And then you have something like this , which is Interplast .
I am not that caring .
You can laugh , this is OK .
This is me .
This is what happened to me .
And then I wrote a post about a banjo .
And those people who know me understood my joke .
How much money does he spend on beer in a year ?
You could take that money and buy your banjo .
Why don &apos;t you open a separate account ? &quot;
And then I got people saying , &quot; Leave him . &quot;
And why are they reading this ? &quot;
I don &apos;t want to write for this public audience .
And I started to kill my blog slowly .
But anyways .
His father was a blogger .
And he never expected this .
And this is a one-pound baby .
So Odin was documented every single day .
Pictures were taken every day : day one , day two ...
But then it gets better . Day 96 he goes home .
And you see this post .
So , blogs .
So what ? You &apos;ve probably heard these things before .
It &apos;s this record of who you are , your persona .
Millions and hundreds of millions and billions of people .
And so , that &apos;s an amazing thing to consider .
And just these little things .
So , that has always influenced me .
I wish that I would have this of my family .
That was an amazing thing .
And that &apos;s a huge thing .
So , thank you .
James Geary : Metaphorically speaking
Metaphor lives a secret life all around us .
We utter about six metaphors a minute .
Lips are not lips , but volcanoes .
She is not she , but a buttercup .
And love is not love , but being all shook up .
This is the mathematics of metaphor .
And fortunately it &apos;s very simple .
X equals Y.
This formula works wherever metaphor is present .
So , how do we make and understand metaphors ?
This might look familiar .
The first step is pattern recognition .
Look at this image . What do you see ?
Three wayward Pac-Men , and three pointy brackets are actually present .
What we see , however , are two overlapping triangles .
Second step , conceptual synesthesia .
We all have synesthetic abilities .
This is the Bouba / Kiki test .
Can we do a quick show of hands ?
Does that correspond ?
Okay , I think 99.9 would about cover it .
Why do we do that ?
And many of the metaphors we use everyday are synesthetic .
Silence is sweet .
Neckties are loud .
Sexually attractive people are hot .
Sexually unattractive people leave us cold .
Third step is cognitive dissonance .
This is the Stroop test .
You can take the test now .
Stroop tests have been done with metaphor as well .
Sadly , it &apos;s metaphorically true .
Metaphor matters because it creates expectations .
Pay careful attention the next time you read the financial news .
That &apos;s a hypothetical example of course .
But this is how metaphor misleads .
Metaphor also matters because it influences decisions by activating analogies .
And they had to make a decision .
What should they do ?
Intervene , appeal to the U.N. , or do nothing ?
Metaphor matters because it opens the door to discovery .
Einstein described his scientific method as combinatory play .
Now metaphor is ubiquitous , yet it &apos;s hidden .
Ralph Waldo Emerson described language as &quot; fossil poetry . &quot;
But before it was fossil poetry language was fossil metaphor .
And these fossils still breathe .
But there is a better translation .
Thank you very much .
Chris Abani : On humanity
In South Africa , they have a phrase called Ubuntu .
It &apos;s really very simple , but really very complicated .
So , I thought I should start with some stories .
And she was dark , too .
My mother was English .
She was five foot two , very feisty and very English .
It &apos;s totally rad . &quot;
I said , &quot; English , mum . &quot;
But her Igbo wasn &apos;t too good .
So she took me along to translate .
I was seven .
And , &quot; Do you notice any discharges ? &quot;
And , &quot; How swollen is your vulva ? &quot;
My mother said , &quot; Someone has to . &quot;
It was my mother with five little children .
And she told this woman .
Dirges so melancholic that they would scorch you .
But today , women are rebuilding Rwanda .
Their humanity never seems to matter very much to us .
And I was supposed to do this alone .
So , this guy comes with me .
I was a wimp .
I cried for a very long time .
And afterwards , he didn &apos;t say a word .
He just sat there watching me cry for an hour .
So , I was born two days after Christmas .
Take anything you want out of the suitcase .
It &apos;s your birthday present . &quot;
So , here was this 14-year-old kid on death row .
And not everybody on death row was a political prisoner .
There were some really bad people there .
He was obsessed .
It &apos;s incredible .
I was really worried .
He didn &apos;t know what death row meant .
Then I &apos;d say , &quot; How do you know ? &quot;
They killed him .
All around us , everywhere , there are people like this .
The Igbo used to say that they built their own gods .
This is how they came to reclaim their humanity .
It doesn &apos;t require a tremendous thing .
&quot; Libation , North Carolina , 1999 .
I offer to this ground , this gin .
I call a name that could be his .
This is for you , old man .
This gin , this salty earth . &quot;
Thank you .
Alexis Ohanian : How to make a splash in social media
That &apos;s what you &apos;d call a social news website .
But this isn &apos;t even about Reddit itself .
It &apos;s actually about humpback whales .
These humpback whales were getting killed .
I believe this is a Farsi word for &quot; immortal . &quot;
And then there was this : Mister Splashy Pants .
And , you know , Redditors responded and all agreed .
Well , that got us a little angry .
So , we changed it to Fightin &apos; Splashy .
Facebook groups were getting created . Facebook applications were getting created .
And this was the final vote . When all was cleared ...
the next highest name pulled in three . Okay ?
So , there was a clear lesson here .
And that was that the Internet loves Mister Splashy Pants .
Which is obvious . It &apos;s a great name .
And I think that &apos;s what helped drive this .
They sell Mister Splashy Pants shirts and pins .
And this is kind of how the Internet works .
Thank you .
Temple Grandin : The world needs all kinds of minds
You wouldn &apos;t have any ...
It &apos;s a continuum of traits .
You have to get away from verbal language .
I think in pictures , I don &apos;t think in language .
And the thing is , the normal brain ignores the details .
People are getting away from doing hands-on stuff .
Rapid movement , contrast .
My drawings got to star in the movie too .
My mind works like Google for images .
I thought everybody thought in pictures .
I see only specific pictures .
OK , how about famous ones ?
Just really quickly , like Google for pictures .
I &apos;m not going to go into any gucky slaughter slides .
That was like just so super cool .
This is tensor imaging .
Now , another kind of mind is the pattern thinker .
More abstract . These are your engineers , your computer programmers .
And there in the background is the pattern for folding it .
Some of these oftentimes have problems with reading .
You &apos;ll see these different kinds of minds .
Now , another thing is the sensory issues .
You know , it &apos;s going to be variable .
He knows who &apos;s been there , when they were there .
There &apos;s a ton of information on that fire hydrant .
Cattle are the same way .
You see , it &apos;s a different picture .
Or do I have something wrong with the equipment ? &quot;
In other words , categorize equipment problem from a people problem .
I find a lot of people have difficulty doing that .
Or is the whole design of the system wrong ?
People have a hard time figuring that out .
Yeah , I &apos;m a million-mile flier .
It would be their airplane tails .
It &apos;s tails , pure and simple .
It &apos;s specific . See , my thinking &apos;s bottom-up .
He &apos;d been abused by somebody with a black cowboy hat .
White cowboy hats , that was absolutely fine .
And this brings up the whole thing of my science teacher .
My science teacher is shown absolutely beautifully in the movie .
He was now Dr. Carlock in the movie .
And they &apos;re not going down the right path .
It &apos;s kind of a trade-off between thinking and social .
This is the work of Dr. Bruce Miller .
We &apos;ve got to show these kids interesting stuff .
I mean art was my best subject in school .
And let &apos;s talk about jobs .
But you know what ? I was getting work experience .
I was taught that when I was eight years old .
I was taught that when I was very , very young .
They &apos;ve got to learn how to do something else .
Let &apos;s say the kid is fixated on Legos .
Let &apos;s get him working on building different things .
It just drives me crazy .
What can visual thinkers do when they grow up ?
And we need to be working with these students .
And this brings up mentors .
You know , my science teacher was not an accredited teacher .
He was a NASA space scientist .
We need to be doing that .
You &apos;re getting that kid turned on .
Mentors are just essential .
I cannot emphasize enough what my science teacher did for me .
And we &apos;ve got to mentor them , hire them .
And it can only use so much memory . &quot;
That &apos;s the kind of specificity you need .
Well , that &apos;s the end of my talk .
And I just want to thank everybody for coming .
It was great to be here .
Oh , you &apos;ve got a question for me ? OK .
Thank you so much for that .
I got social interaction through shared interest .
That was like , we considered that super cool .
What are you most passionate about ?
How many cattle got poked with the prodder ?
How many cattle are mooing their heads off ?
And it &apos;s very , very simple .
You directly observe a few simple things .
It &apos;s libraries .
And this is before the Internet got really big .
TG : Well thank you so much . Thank you .
Wael Ghonim : Inside the Egyptian revolution
This is Revolution 2.0 .
No one was a hero . No one was a hero .
Because everyone was a hero .
Everyone has done something .
We all use Wikipedia .
Everything was going bad .
Everything was going wrong .
Those were the achievements of our great regime .
Yet , nothing was happening .
In fact , people were extremely frustrated .
Everyone was scared .
But in fact , the majority were scared .
Everyone did not want really to get in trouble .
A dictator cannot live without the force .
They want to make people live in fear .
It &apos;s helping all of us to connect .
There are a lot of people who are frustrated . &quot;
There are lots of people who are frustrated .
There are lots of people who actually share the same dream .
There are lots of people who care about their freedom .
They probably have the best life in the world .
They are happy . They don &apos;t have problems .
But they are still feeling the pain of the Egyptian .
It was an educational campaign .
Khaled Saeed was killed in June 2010 .
I still remember the photo .
I still remember every single detail of that photo .
The photo was horrible .
He was tortured , brutally tortured to death .
But then what was the answer of the regime ?
He &apos;s someone who escaped from all these bad things . &quot;
But people did not relate to this .
People did not believe this .
He was a middle-class guy .
His photo was remembered by all of us .
A page was created .
Get those who killed this guy .
To just bring them to justice . &quot;
But of course , they don &apos;t listen .
Everyone was an owner in this page .
People started contributing ideas .
And next time it &apos;s going to be vibration . &quot;
People were making fun of the idea .
And they were doing this thing .
But did the regime learn anything ? Not really .
They were actually attacking them .
And things had developed until the Tunisian revolution .
This whole page was , again , managed by the people .
There was no leader .
The leader was everyone on that page .
Yes we can . We can do it .
The revolution is happening .
I was detained on the 27th night .
Thank God I announced the locations and everything .
But they detained me .
I was detained for 12 days , blindfolded , handcuffed .
I was not allowed to speak with anyone .
And I went out .
The next day I was in Tahrir .
The fear is no longer fear .
It &apos;s actually strength -- it &apos;s power .
People were so empowered .
Completely opposite .
Extremism became tolerance .
I said that , &quot; We are going to win .
We are going to win because we don &apos;t understand politics .
We &apos;re going to win because we have dreams .
And that &apos;s actually what happened . We won .
For me that &apos;s winning , regardless of all the details .
Thanks a lot .
Dean Ornish : Healing through diet
To me , that &apos;s the real natural wonder .
And it &apos;s not a diet .
We used quantitative arteriography , showing the narrowing .
Huge differences can occur without drugs , without surgery .
You just never know .
It &apos;s important , but not enough .
Well , because it helps them get through the day .
The most effective anti-smoking ad was this one .
Your sexual function improves .
You feel kind of sleepy afterwards .
Mississippi , more than 25 percent of people are overweight .
but it doesn &apos;t last , which is the problem .
The other way is to change the type of food .
But insulin accelerates the conversion of calories into fat .
So , and you get all the disease-protective substances .
And these are predominantly what are called the Omega-3 fatty acids .
You find these , for example , in fish oil .
He says , &quot; I &apos;ve got some good news .
They just met once a week for a year .
It was a randomized control study published in The Lancet .
Other studies have shown this as well .
Thank you .
R.A. Mashelkar : Breakthrough designs for ultra-low-cost products
The big residual is always value for money .
All the time we are trying to get value for money .
But if you don &apos;t have money , what happens ?
Well , poor do not remain poor ; they become lower-middle-class .
They believe that things can be done .
But great leaders like Ratan have compassion .
Let me confirm what she said .
Yes , I went barefoot until I was 12 .
I struggled to &#91; unclear &#93; day was a huge issue .
That &apos;s how I &apos;m standing before you .
So that is the House of Tata .
Innovation , compassion and passion .
They combine all that .
And you can see the cartoon here .
And incredible car .
We &apos;ll manufacture a car in the Nano Segment . &quot;
How did this great story unfold , the making of Nano ?
Let me tell you a bit about it .
And he told them , &quot; Question the unquestionable .
Stretch the envelope . &quot;
Can you believe it ?
Until midnight , he &apos;d be thinking .
Early morning he &apos;ll be coming back with sort of solutions .
But who was the team leader ?
And the Nano team average age was just 27 years .
And they did innovation in design and beyond .
Broke many norms of the standard conventions for the first time .
Adhesives were replacing the rivets .
All ideas on board were welcome .
I mean , it was incredible innovation .
Seeking solutions for non-auto sectors .
The fuel lines and lamps were as in two-wheelers .
All the time , you have been given an envelope .
And therefore , each component had to have a dual functionality .
The length is smaller by eight percent by the way .
Volkswagon was 11,333 .
And British Motor was around 11,000 .
And Nano was , bang , 2,000 dollars .
And those dreams are getting fulfilled .
The driver &apos;s name is Naran .
He has bought his own Nano .
And that &apos;s why I call it a transformational innovation .
What is its price ? 20,000 dollars .
Unfortunately , that &apos;s not the case in India .
And they climb up for their work .
You have to design an artificial foot for such conditions .
A challenge , of course .
You just don &apos;t have it .
And therefore , you ought to look at alternatives .
And that is how Jaipur Foot was created in India .
... above the limb , yes , it would be difficult ...
&quot; Did it hurt ? &quot;
&quot; No ... not at all . &quot;
So that &apos;s what it is all about .
And therefore Time took notice of this 28-dollar foot , basically .
An incredible story .
Let &apos;s move on to something else .
I &apos;ve been talking about getting more from less for more .
Let &apos;s move to health .
What &apos;s happening in the area of health ?
You know , you have new diseases that require new drugs .
Today it costs 1.5 billion dollars .
No , I &apos;m sorry .
Let us just take an example .
Psoriasis is very dreadful disease of the skin .
The cost of treatment , 20,000 dollars .
Can we do it &#91; for &#93; 100 dollars ?
Time for development , not 10 years .
We are in a hurry . Five years .
Cost of development -- 300 million dollars .
Sorry . I can &apos;t spend more than 10 million dollars .
Looks absolutely audacious .
Looks absolutely ridiculous .
You know something ? This has been achieved in India .
These targets have been achieved in India .
And how they have been achieved ...
And that is how this difference has come .
You can see before treatment and after treatment .
Let me just remind you of what Mahatma Gandhi had said .
It &apos;s not about low cost .
It &apos;s about ultra-low cost .
You &apos;re not talking exclusive innovation .
You &apos;re talking about inclusive innovation .
You know , incubators for infants , for example .
They &apos;re not available in Africa .
They &apos;re not available in Indian villages .
And infants die .
And incubator costs 2,000 dollars .
And by whom ?
Their heart is in the right place , like Ratan Tata .
That &apos;s the new world that we want to create .
And that is why the message is that of Gandhian engineering .
Ladies and gentlemen , I &apos;d like to end before time .
I was also afraid of those 18 minutes .
I &apos;ve still one and a half to go .
What was that ?
And that can come only from Gandhian engineering .
Lakshmi Pratury : Thank you , Dr. Mashelkar .
LP : A quick question for you .
What do you think that drove you ?
It was &#91; unclear &#93; high school .
But it was a poor school with rich teachers , honestly .
And there was a bright spot up there .
But then he held it for a little while , Lakshmi .
And then the paper burned .
But more importantly , focus and you can achieve .
What does that focal length do ?
It has parallel lines , which are sun rays .
And the property of parallel lines is that they never meet .
What does that convex lens do ?
It makes them meet .
This is convex lens leadership .
You know what today &apos;s leadership is doing ? Concave length .
They divide them farther .
So I learned the lesson of convex lens leadership from that .
And when I was at National Chemical Laboratory &#91; unclear &#93; .
That was the lesson . That was the inspirational moment .
LP : Thank you very much .
Steven Pinker : What our language habits reveal
The problem is , which verbs go in which constructions ?
The verb is the chassis of the sentence .
It &apos;s the framework onto which the other parts are bolted .
For example , the dative construction in English .
Hundreds of verbs can go both ways .
This would be an example of how to do that .
Unfortunately , there appear to be idiosyncratic exceptions .
How are these construals reflected in language ?
Only humans can possess things .
So why should anyone care ?
&quot; The messenger went from Paris to Istanbul . &quot;
This kind of indirect speech is rampant in language .
I think most people understand the intent behind that .
No one &apos;s fooled .
So what &apos;s going on ?
Now , relationship types can be negotiated .
Well , what does this have to do with language ?
The simplest example of this is in the polite request .
On the other hand , you want the damn guacamole .
if language -- where it could only be used literally .
Nothing ventured , nothing gained .
In that case , the consequences are rather severe .
So this is a rather fraught situation .
So you get the best of both worlds .
Thank you very much .
Charles Leadbeater : The era of open innovation
That &apos;s 58 billion dollars .
That &apos;s the idea of creativity .
More special people , more special places .
Expand the pipeline down to the consumers .
Well this view , I think , is increasingly wrong .
Why is that ?
The payoffs to innovation are greatest where the uncertainty is highest .
So , you &apos;re in a big corporation .
You &apos;re obviously keen to go up the corporate ladder .
Big corporations have an in-built tendency to reinforce past success .
.
So what happens ? Rap music is created by the users .
They work at their leisure , if you like .
This has huge organizational implications for very large areas of life .
Take astronomy as an example , which Yochai has already mentioned .
And it was huge -- it was absolutely enormous .
The users can be producers .
What does this mean , then , for our organizational landscape ?
This is open ; this is closed .
This is new ; this is traditional .
Let me just give you two examples .
There &apos;ll be huge professional arguments as well .
They &apos;re not reading my brilliant article ! &quot;
Those were the two places .
They want to be part of that flow of information .
So , there &apos;s going to be a tremendous struggle .
The first is : can we really survive on volunteers ?
What should be the role of public policy ?
And I was having dinner with this guy called Timothy Chan .
Timothy Chan set up an Internet business in 2000 .
Nine thousand servers all over China , has 250 million subscribers .
How many people does he employ to service that population ?
500 people .
Because basically , he doesn &apos;t service them .
You &apos;ve got two options .
That costs about 100 dollars .
Thank you very much .
Richard Sears : Planning for the end of oil
And one of the reasons is this is remarkable stuff .
It &apos;s great stuff .
A bigger one for you to look at .
Geologists have a pretty good idea of where the oil is .
But there &apos;s actually more to the story than that .
Now , it &apos;s about 35 percent .
So oil is playing a less significant role every year .
And what goes on in the future ?
What is the future of truly sustainable , carbon-free energy ?
Here &apos;s a piece of limestone .
I picked it up outside of Marble Falls , Texas .
It &apos;s about 400 million years old .
And it &apos;s just limestone , nothing really special about it .
Now , here &apos;s a piece of chalk .
What &apos;s different is how the molecules are put together .
Now , millions of abalone every year make this shell .
But it &apos;s not the same stuff ; it &apos;s different .
This is pretty incredible stuff .
All the same , what &apos;s different ?
How the molecules are put together .
Now , what does this have to do with energy ?
Here &apos;s a piece of coal .
And so that is my story .
The oil will never run out .
It &apos;s not because we have a lot of it .
Thank you very much .
Kamal Meattle : How to grow fresh air
The botanical names are in front of you .
And we need six to eight waist-high plants per person .
And this particular plant removes formaldehydes and other volatile chemicals .
And it has close to 1,200 such plants for 300 occupants .
Why is this important ?
And thank you for listening .
Maz Jobrani : Did you hear the one about the Iranian-American ?
Then there was Aron Kader , who was the Palestinian-American .
And then there was me , the Iranian-American of the group .
Those two countries aren &apos;t getting along these days .
These are dilemmas I have every day .
So I remember getting my American passport .
&quot; I &apos;m trying to go places . &quot;
&quot; Ah ha ! American , great . &quot;
And he started asking me questions .
He said , &quot; What is your father &apos;s name ? &quot;
He goes , &quot; What is your grandfather &apos;s name ? &quot;
I said , &quot; He passed away a long time ago .
His name was Jabbar . &quot;
You owe us two billion dollars . &quot;
Like I think you &apos;re missing the point here .
&quot; Why would I do that ?
Right .
&quot; Well , then blow yourself up .
Just do it outside , please . &quot;
But the fact is , there &apos;s good people everywhere .
All it takes in one person to mess it up .
&quot; We just wanted to say we tried . &quot;
&quot; And furthermore , it is the thought that counts . &quot;
&quot; And in conclusion , win some , lose some . &quot;
Don &apos;t be Hassan . Don &apos;t be Hussein . &quot;
That &apos;s not one of us . &quot;
&quot; Damn it ! Why Jack ? Why ? &quot;
I just did a seven-country solo tour .
I was in Oman , and I was in Saudi Arabia .
I was in Dubai .
And it &apos;s great , there &apos;s good people everywhere .
And you learn great things about these places .
I encourage people always to go visit these places .
For example , Dubai -- cool place .
They have a mall there , the Dubai Mall .
It is so big , they have taxis in the mall .
I was walking . I heard &quot; Beep , beep . &quot;
I &apos;m like , &quot; What are you doing here ? &quot;
It &apos;s like a drug deal .
&quot; You want some frozen yogurt ?
Come here . Come here . Come here .
Not in the Middle East .
And I &apos;ve been guilty of stereotyping as well .
And they don &apos;t get paid that well .
He goes , &quot; I thought you were my driver . &quot;
&quot; My name is Bond , Jamal Bond . &quot;
Have a good day . Thank you .
Stefana Broadbent : How the Internet enables intimacy
And what do I mean by that ?
And somebody brought a boyfriend , somebody a father .
One young woman brought her grandfather .
Now , lets take some data . Facebook .
A lot of sociologists actually are quite disappointed .
There are three stories that I think are quite good examples .
The first gentleman , he &apos;s a baker .
And I &apos;ve heard this story a number of times .
Then there is another couple , there is a Brazilian couple .
They &apos;ve lived in Italy for a number of years .
They Skype with their families a few times a week .
And now , obviously , they have it open .
Whenever they have a moment they chat to each other .
So , none of these cases are unique .
I mean , I could tell you hundreds of them .
But what is really exceptional is the setting .
Maybe you had a direct line .
And it had nothing to do with technical capability .
That was where the focus had to be .
And then the school enacts perfectly well .
They were living on top of the land they were laboring .
And they are doing it massively .
I really think that the number is conservative .
100 percent are using text .
But there are many institutions that are actually blocking this access .
Companies blocking access to IM or to Facebook .
Terry Moore : How to tie your shoes
And I think that &apos;s true .
Now I know that seems ludicrous .
I know that seems ludicrous .
But not so -- let me demonstrate .
Now as it turns out -- thank you .
Wait , there &apos;s more .
And here &apos;s how to tell .
That &apos;s the weak form of the knot .
But not to worry .
We &apos;re going to do this one more time .
Start as usual , go the other way around the loop .
Pull the knot .
There it is : the strong form of the shoe knot .
Live long and prosper .
Roger Ebert : Remaking my voice
It was like breathing .
I used to be able to talk like that .
I will start with my wife , Chaz .
The first surgery was a great success .
I saw myself in the mirror and I looked pretty good .
Two weeks later , I was ready to return home .
Suddenly , I had an episode of catastrophic bleeding .
My carotid artery had ruptured .
So thank you , Leonard Cohen , for saving my life .
&quot; It was the clearest I could find .
How does that affect who you are as a person ?
How did I feel not being able to speak ?
I &apos;ve become uncomfortable when I &apos;m separated from my laptop .
At first I was against it .
But I decided then to just give it a try .
They &apos;d never made one from previously-recorded materials .
But they were willing to give it a try .
And it sounded like me , it really did .
There was a reason for that ; it was me .
But it wasn &apos;t that simple .
I &apos;ll let you hear a sample of that voice .
And here &apos;s the voice we call Roger Jr .
or Roger 2.0 .
This is the first version of my computer voice .
When I read something , it will read in my voice .
The voice was created by a company in Scotland named CereProc .
This is the first voice they &apos;ve created for an individual .
The flow isn &apos;t natural .
A very large sample is needed .
John Hunter : All my life I was a motormouth .
In cosmological terms , that was about 10 minutes ago .
That has mostly happened in my lifetime .
It was about 1960 .
The initials stood for Programmed Logic for Automated Teaching Operations .
The programmers said it could assist students in their learning .
But that &apos;s not the point .
But I &apos;m not here from the Chamber of Commerce .
I &apos;m here as a man who wants to communicate .
All of this has happened in my lifetime .
Does anybody remember that ? &quot;
It is unimaginable what will happen next .
For billions of years , the universe evolved completely without notice .
We are born into a box of time and space .
I cannot speak ; I can only type so fast .
They give me a way to speak .
Not everybody has the patience of my wife , Chaz .
But online , everybody speaks at the same speed .
This whole adventure has been a learning experience .
Now I have no jaw left at all .
But no you don &apos;t .
People -- People talk loudly -- I &apos;m so sorry .
Excuse me .
People talk loudly and slowly to me .
Sometimes they assume I am deaf .
There are people who don &apos;t want to make eye contact .
You should never let your wife read something like this .
It is human nature to look away from illness .
We don &apos;t enjoy a reminder of our own fragile mortality .
My ability to think and write have not been affected .
And on the Web , my real voice finds expression .
One of my Twitter friends can type only with his toes .
Google him and he will make you laugh .
So I have not come here to complain .
I have much to make me happy and relieved .
I seem , for the time being , to be cancer-free .
I am writing as well as ever .
I am productive .
I would be trapped inside my head .
RE : Wait . I have one more thing to add .
A guy goes into a psychiatrist .
The psychiatrist says , &quot; You &apos;re crazy . &quot;
The guy says , &quot; I want a second opinion . &quot;
James Burchfield : Playing invisible turntables
Let &apos;s just get started here .
Okay , just a moment .
All right .
Oh , sorry .
Thank you .
Steven Cowley : Fusion is energy &apos;s future
I &apos;ve always been very worried about resource .
And as a child you &apos;re always worried about resource .
Big events in my life , a strange child .
Energy , at the moment , is dominated by resource .
And those resources are going away .
Fission .
China is building nuclear power stations . Everybody is .
Fusion is very hard to do .
We &apos;ve been trying for 50 years .
Okay . What is fusion ? Here comes the nuclear physics .
I was a strange child .
Nuclear energy comes for a simple reason .
It &apos;s a medium-sized nucleus .
And you can get energy out this way .
And indeed that &apos;s exactly what stars do .
And you push them together and they repel .
So , most of the time they repel .
And that energy is what powers fusion .
And it &apos;s this reaction that we want to do .
There is one trickiness about this reaction .
You have to make it from something else .
And that &apos;s the way you make your tritium .
Now , why the hell would we bother to do this ?
This is basically why we would bother to do it .
And the yellow line is the most optimistic estimate .
And then we get to uranium .
To go any further you would have to have breeder technology .
Is it cost-competitive ?
And we get within about the same price as current electricity .
So , how would we make it ?
We have to hold something at 150 million degrees .
And , in fact , we &apos;ve done this .
We hold it with a magnetic field .
It boils away in the middle at 150 million degrees .
And in fact we can make fusion happen .
And just down the road , this is JET .
This is the device we &apos;re building now .
It gets very expensive to do this research .
Seven nations are involved in building this .
But that &apos;s not electricity yet .
We have to get to this .
We have to get to a power plant .
I wish this were different . We really need it now .
So 2030 looks like an infinity away .
Camille Seaman : Photos from a storm chaser
Everything is interconnected .
As a Shinnecock Indian , I was raised to know this .
There were no clouds in the sky .
And after a while I began to perspire .
That &apos;s part of you up there .
Storm chasing is a very tactile experience .
I &apos;ve learned to respect the lightning .
My hair used to be straight .
I &apos;m just kidding .
They become lovely monsters .
All my relations . Thank you .
Tony Robbins : Why we do what we do
What is your motive for action ?
All of us here have great minds .
And with our minds we can rationalize anything .
But we all know that that &apos;s bullshit at times .
But I really want to know what &apos;s driving you .
What makes the difference in their performance ? &quot;
Because that &apos;s what I got hired to do .
I &apos;ve got to produce the result now .
How do you make a change ?
Because science is easy , right ?
But when it comes to fulfillment -- that &apos;s an art .
Audience : Aye .
Thanks for the interaction on a high level there .
Supreme Court .
And you correct me if I &apos;m wrong .
The defining factor is never resources ; it &apos;s resourcefulness .
Audience : Aye .
Audience : Yes .
The story people tell us is a bunch of different stories .
But I appreciated the energy , I &apos;ll tell you that .
Honestly , better or worse ? Say , &quot; Aye . &quot;
Audience : Aye .
How would their lives be different ? Their impact ?
The history of our world is these decisions .
But what was his decision of what to focus on ?
Different than most people . What did it mean ?
We all have had time .
Say , &quot; Aye . &quot;
Audience : Aye .
Your model of the world is what shapes you long term .
That &apos;s what makes people make decisions .
And it &apos;s made up of three parts , I believe .
First , what &apos;s your target ? What are you after ?
Which , I believe -- it &apos;s not your desires .
How many have been there ? Say , &quot; Aye . &quot;
Audience : Aye .
We need variety . We need surprise .
Audience : Aye .
Bullshit . You like the surprises you want .
You can do it by being more spiritual .
And you &apos;re going to get hurt again .
Aren &apos;t you glad you came to this positive visit ?
Because the sixth need is to contribute beyond ourselves .
You can feel the difference in him and it &apos;s beautiful .
It &apos;s been fantastic .
Thank you .
The last thing is emotion .
How may know somebody like this ? Come on .
And she played the recording for us in the room .
10 seconds .
Thank you . I hope this was of service .
Vik Muniz : Art with wire , sugar , chocolate and string
I was asked to come here and speak about creation .
Creativity is how we cope with creation .
See , for instance , in this picture .
I just did things .
You didn &apos;t trust information very much .
Somebody was hitting somebody else with brass knuckles .
The first works were actually objects .
And I called them relics .
They were displayed first at Stux Gallery in 1983 .
This is the clown skull .
They lived in Brazil , long time ago .
This is the Ashanti joystick .
The rocking podium .
This is the pre-Columbian coffeemaker .
The Bonsai table .
So I decided to do work with clouds .
Because clouds can mean anything you want .
&quot; The Snail . &quot;
&quot; The Teapot . &quot;
And he did something that was very tricky .
He put together two different media from different periods of time .
And it &apos;s totally overkill .
And your eye doesn &apos;t know which level to read .
And you become trapped into this kind of representation .
&quot; Relaxation . &quot;
&quot; Fiat Lux . &quot;
And I wanted to deal with other subjects .
So this is a lighthouse .
I got some photographs from them .
&quot; Valicia . &quot;
&quot; Jacynthe . &quot;
But another layer of representation was still introduced .
So they &apos;re called &quot; Pictures of Chocolate . &quot;
And Jackson Pollock also .
&quot; Paparazzi . &quot;
And I picked minimalist pieces because they &apos;re about specificity .
This is Richard Serra .
This is a pipe .
A hanger .
So they &apos;re like perfect actors .
Well , I think that &apos;s it .
My time is nearly up .
Thank you very much .
Greg Stone : Saving the ocean one island at a time
Brian Skerry took this shot . Thanks , Brian .
And I &apos;ve dived in deep-sea submersibles around the world .
I needed to put it into a context .
I needed to head towards conservation goals .
I led three diving expeditions to Antarctica .
And therefore we &apos;re way behind on protection .
So where are the Phoenix Islands ?
They &apos;ve never been dived . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Yeah .
But I was in for the adventure .
It &apos;s a very deep-water part of our planet .
The average depths are about 12,000 ft .
Seamounts are important for biodiversity .
It &apos;s an interesting fact .
And the Phoenix Islands is very rich in those seamounts .
Both my personal and my professional life changed .
Phoenix Islands is a major tuna location .
And we finished our trip .
And that &apos;s the area again .
And what &apos;s the context of the Phoenix Islands ?
Where do these exist ?
In the west we have the Gilbert Islands .
And then over to the east we have the Line Islands .
It &apos;s the largest atoll nation in the world .
And they have about 110,000 people spread out over 33 islands .
Because that &apos;s where all the ocean is . &quot;
They &apos;re also a country that is in dire danger .
The Islands rise only one to two meters above the surface .
Some of the islands have already gone under water .
And these nations are faced with a real problem .
We as a world are faced with a problem .
So it &apos;s something we need to focus on .
Just get whatever anybody wants . &quot;
They &apos;d never had any information from the Phoenix Islands .
And are you free for dinner ? &quot;
He coined the term &quot; reverse fishing license . &quot;
And Conservation International had struck some of those deals .
Many , many steps were taken to pull this off .
And that &apos;s the story with climate-change heating .
And it certainly was .
So the conditions for success here are listed .
You can read them yourselves .
How do we realize Sylvia &apos;s dream ?
Where eventually do we take this ?
Thank you very much .
Jake Barton : The museum of you
This is Charley Williams .
He was 94 when this photograph was taken .
The idea is very , very simple .
You can see it in Pedro .
Where &apos;s the right finger ?
DB : Yes . Of course . I love you .
My grandfather was a cab driver for 40 years .
He used to pick people up here every day .
So it seems right .
This is a shot from the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel .
Voice 10 : Trying to frantically get to a radio .
My business partner told me to turn on the television .
Voice 15 : So I switched on the television .
This is the so-called slurry wall .
&quot; How could 9 / 11 have happened ? &quot;
You can see the relationships between the different names themselves .
Thank you very much .
Stacey Kramer : The best gift I ever survived
Imagine , if you will -- a gift .
I &apos;d like for you to picture it in your mind .
So envision what it looks like all wrapped up .
It will bring all of your family together .
Adoration and admiration will overwhelm you .
It will recalibrate what &apos;s most important in your life .
It will redefine your sense of spirituality and faith .
You &apos;ll have a new understanding and trust in your body .
You &apos;ll have unsurpassed vitality and energy .
You &apos;ll eat countless gourmet meals .
Flowers will arrive by the truckload .
And you &apos;ll have a lifetime supply of good drugs .
You &apos;ll be challenged , inspired , motivated and humbled .
Your life will have new meaning .
Peace , health , serenity , happiness , nirvana .
The price ?
$ 55,000 , and that &apos;s an incredible deal .
Does Amazon carry it ?
Does it have the Apple logo on it ?
Is there a waiting list ?
Not likely .
This gift came to me about five months ago .
And this , and then this .
I &apos;m not sure you &apos;d want it .
But I wouldn &apos;t change my experience .
Rory Stewart : Time to end the war in Afghanistan
The question today is not : Why did we invade Afghanistan ?
Why are we spending $ 135 billion ?
Why have we got 130,000 troops on the ground ?
How has this happened ?
So the question is : What are we doing ?
Why are we still stuck in Afghanistan ?
All of this is wrong .
Every one of those statements is wrong .
Afghanistan does not pose an existential threat to global security .
They simply don &apos;t have a conventional military option .
Because this isn &apos;t the 1990s anymore .
Today , there are 14 health clinics in that area alone .
There was amazing improvements .
And we had progress in the free media .
And the same is true for the troops .
This is Commandant Haji Malem Mohsin Khan of Kamenj .
Commandant Haji Malem Mohsin Khan of Kamenj was a great host .
Today , he could never do that .
Now is this a new idea ?
And yet , nobody listened to them .
Instead , there was a litany of astonishing optimism .
Well guess what ? It didn &apos;t .
How do we allow any of this to happen ?
You feel deep , deep guilt .
What is the solution to this ?
We need to somehow get their message to the policymakers .
And this is very difficult to do because of our structures .
Diplomats are locked in embassy compounds .
And there was not a single Pashto speaker .
So we need to change that institutional culture .
And thirdly , we need to have some humility .
It isn &apos;t .
Bosnia and Kosovo were signal successes , great successes .
A million properties have been returned .
The national army has shrunk .
But you need to look at context .
And this is what we &apos;ve lost in Afghanistan and Iraq .
We criticized them for being quite slow to return refugees .
We &apos;re not matching our resources to our priorities .
Why mountain rescue ?
This is the wrong way of looking at it .
It &apos;s about context .
It makes failure invisible , inconceivable and inevitable .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you .
Rory , you mentioned Libya at the end .
And we are always being tempted up to our neck .
We could have done that .
Rory , thank you very much .
RS : Thank you .
Geoff Mulgan : A short intro to the Studio School
What I want to talk about today is one idea .
You work by learning , and you learn by working .
And the design we came up with had the following characteristics .
We started with two schools .
That &apos;s grown this year to about 10 .
Interestingly , it &apos;s happened almost entirely without media coverage .
It &apos;s happened almost entirely without big money behind it .
And this one is focused on creative and media industries .
We think we &apos;re onto something .
It doesn &apos;t animate them .
Thank you very much .
Jack Horner : Where are the baby dinosaurs ?
None , huh ?
All right .
I &apos;m going to talk about dinosaurs .
Do you remember dinosaurs when you were that age ?
Dinosaurs are kind of funny , you know .
I hope you all realize that .
That &apos;s it .
What &apos;s the fascination ?
They &apos;re all gone .
Now I assume that we remember dinosaurs .
And there &apos;s lots of different shapes .
Lots of different kinds .
They went out and gathered them up .
And this is an interesting story .
And that happened for all museums .
And this was in the early 1900s .
Look at these dinosaurs .
They &apos;re all big .
Where are all the little ones ? &quot;
You &apos;d have a big dinosaur and a littler dinosaur .
But all they had were big dinosaurs .
And it comes down to a couple of things .
They like to name anything .
Everybody likes to have their own animal that they named .
In 1975 , a light went on in somebody &apos;s head .
And in fact , he used the cassowary as an example .
Now think about that .
So allometric cranial ontogeny is relative skull growth .
So this was interesting .
So this is where people went astray again .
But scientists have egos ; they like to name things .
And so they went on naming dinosaurs because they were different .
And that &apos;s by actually cutting into their bones .
They put them in foam , little containers .
They &apos;re very well taken care of .
So they don &apos;t normally let you do that .
So that &apos;s what I do .
You can tell it &apos;s mature bone .
So it &apos;s real easy to tell them apart .
So what I want to do is show you these .
And so we will evaluate them .
And that &apos;s sort of what I &apos;ve been doing .
they say , &quot; Go away . &quot;
So here are 12 dinosaurs .
And we want to look at these three first .
So these are dinosaurs that are called Pachycephalosaurs .
And everybody knows that these three animals are related .
You can only determine relatedness by looking for similarities .
Guess where that came from ? Dragon .
Nobody noticed the gnarly stuff sort of looked alike .
And the other one is more primitive than the other .
And one would think , that should give me a clue .
But it didn &apos;t give them a clue .
Because , well we know why .
Scientists like to name things .
So it is going to get bigger .
The dome , that little dome , is growing really fast .
It &apos;s inflating very fast .
Which of course means that Stygimoloch and Dracorex are extinct .
Okay .
And we know why , right ?
Because everybody wants to have a big one .
So everyone had a big one .
They &apos;re everywhere . They &apos;re all over the place .
So we have a whole bunch of them at our museum .
And everybody says it &apos;s because I have a little museum .
When you have a little museum , you have little dinosaurs .
And then as they grow older , the horns grow forward .
And that &apos;s pretty cool .
And the little one is really spongy .
And the middle size one is really spongy .
But what was interesting was the adult Triceratops was also spongy .
And this is a skull that is two meters long .
It &apos;s a big skull .
But it &apos;s got these big holes in its shield .
&quot; And it has holes in its frill . &quot;
So now we know that Torosaurus is actually a grownup Triceratops .
So Torosaurus is extinct .
I mean , here &apos;s Edmontosaurus and Anatotitan .
Anatotitan : giant duck .
It &apos;s a giant duck-bill dinosaur .
Here &apos;s another one .
So we look at the bone histology .
And we get rid of Anatotitan .
So we can just keep doing this .
And the last one is T. Rex .
So there &apos;s these two dinosaurs , T. Rex and Nanotyrannus .
Again , makes you wonder .
But they had a good question .
So it must be true -- they must be different . &quot;
So we cut into them .
It looks like it could still get bigger .
And of course , Nano has 17 .
And that &apos;s a good number .
That &apos;s a good number to go extinct , I think .
Fourth-graders love their dinosaurs , they memorize them .
And they &apos;re not happy with this .
Thank you very much .

Jared Diamond : Why do societies collapse ?
What about ourselves ?
The fourth item on my checklist is relations with hostile societies .
What about a society today ?
But scratch the surface , and Montana suffers from serious problems .
Going through the same checklist : human environmental impacts ?
Are there any general conclusions that arise ?
How could the Easter Islanders have deforested their environment ?
I &apos;ll just mention two generalizations in this area .
What &apos;s going to be the outcome today ?
Morley : &quot; Women of Hope &quot;
Malcolm Gladwell : The unheard story of David and Goliath
Still same is true of Israel today .
And 3,000 years ago , that &apos;s exactly what happens .
They &apos;re originally from Crete . They &apos;re a seafaring people .
This was a tradition in ancient warfare called single combat .
He &apos;s 6 foot 9 .
You &apos;re this kid . This is this mighty warrior . &quot;
So he says , &quot; All right . &quot;
He says , &quot; I can &apos;t wear this stuff . &quot;
That &apos;s all he &apos;s carrying .
Now why do we call David an underdog ?
In ancient warfare , there are three kinds of warriors .
There &apos;s cavalry , men on horseback and with chariots .
It &apos;s in fact an incredibly devastating weapon .
This is an incredibly devastating weapon .
They were incredibly accurate .
Saul has the same expectation .
But David has absolutely no expectation .
That &apos;s where his strength lies .
There &apos;s a second piece of this that &apos;s important .
It &apos;s also that we profoundly misunderstand Goliath .
Goliath is not what he seems to be .
Now that is weird , right ?
Here is this mighty warrior challenging the Israelites to one-on-one combat .
He &apos;s not even carrying a sword .
Why does Goliath not react to that ?
Sticks ? David only has one stick .
There have been many articles written .
He had acromegaly .
Do you remember the wrestler André the Giant ?
Famous . He had acromegaly .
There &apos;s even speculation that Abraham Lincoln had acromegaly .
Because he can &apos;t make his way on his own .
Because he can &apos;t see him .
Come to me because I can &apos;t see you .
He sees two sticks when David has only one .
Giants are not as strong and powerful as they seem .
And sometimes the shepherd boy has a sling in his pocket .
Thank you .
Bernie Krause : The voice of the natural world
But they do .
The soundscape is made up of three basic sources .
The second of these is the biophony .
They were just there , but they had no significance .
This is Lincoln Meadow .
This is an example of a spectrogram .
There were a lot of them .
And here &apos;s Lincoln Meadow before selective logging .
This is after selective logging .
Coming up is the sound of a woodpecker .
However , our ears tell us a very different story .
But I can tell you that they do express themselves .
Whether or not we understand it is a different story .
And they do that for two reasons .
I want to end with a story told by a beaver .
Yeah . Well .
Thank you for listening .
Aparna Rao : High-tech art
So my uncle is only dealing with a mechanical interface .
And at the slightest sound , they hide back again .
So we had these panels on three walls of a room .
So this is how it works .
This is a video prototype .
And they hear like humans do , or real creatures do .
So they get immune to sounds that scare them after awhile .
And they don &apos;t react to background sounds .
So this is a very early prototype .
Of course , it got much better after that .
This is a video installation called &quot; The Missing Person . &quot;
How would it be possible to experience a sense of invisibility ?
Soren enters the room . Pop ! He goes invisible .
So this is a work called &quot; The Sun Shadow . &quot;
So this work is a caricature of an upside-down man .
And it &apos;s kind of constrained by that circle .
And there &apos;s no wires .
That &apos;s my colleague . He &apos;s let it go .
And it &apos;s at the scale of the night sky .
Thank you .
Charles Robertson : Africa &apos;s next boom
Africa is booming .
It &apos;s that quick .
And malaria nets actually are playing a role in that .
This shouldn &apos;t surprise us , because actually , everybody grows .
And the West is engaging with that .
Politics gets weaker when debt is high .
The private sector as well .
That &apos;s an awful lot of debt .
Does anyone recognize this ? In fact , they do .
And this investment is actually Western-led .
Ten percent &apos;s come from India .
And they &apos;re investing in energy .
Africa produces 10 million barrels a day of oil now .
It &apos;s the same as Saudi Arabia or Russia .
And they &apos;re investing in telecoms , shopping malls .
And it &apos;s not just about African demographics .
Now , that &apos;s completely changed now .
So where do you set up your new factory ?
You look at South Asia , and people are .
A bit dangerous , sometimes .
Would you set up a factory in sub-Sahara in the mid-1970s ?
Nobody else did .
So what &apos;s Africa looking like today ?
This is how I look at Africa .
It &apos;s a bit odd , because I &apos;m an economist .
South Africa is playing a role .
And I &apos;m showing you something else with these maps .
I &apos;m showing you democracy versus autocracy .
Fragile democracies is the beige color .
Strong democracies are the orange color .
Why does that matter ?
He won by a margin .
So democracy is encouraging governments to invest in education .
It &apos;s a positive , virtuous circle .
How can you invest in Africa when there &apos;s corruption ? &quot;
When you &apos;re poor , corruption is not your biggest priority .
Three out of 10 . That &apos;s not good .
Every poor country is corrupt .
Every rich country is relatively uncorrupt .
You see the middle class grow .
Economists aren &apos;t great at forecasting .
Because the question really is , what happens next ?
People got poorer in Africa in the 1990s .
No offense .
India is one of those examples .
This is Indian growth from 1960 to 2010 .
Ignore the scale on the bottom for a second .
And then something happened in 1980 .
Boom ! India began to explode .
Life expectancy is going to go up by 13 years .
&quot; Charlie , why are you so pessimistic ? &quot;
And you know what ?
Actually , I think they &apos;ve got a point .
And I think here we can play a role .
Because technology does let you help .
No , not right now , just 30 seconds .
You can go and buy some of the great tunes .
My iPod &apos;s full of them .
Buy African products .
Invest .
Thank you very much .
Jimmy Wales : The birth of Wikipedia
And everything about Wikipedia is managed by virtually an all-volunteer staff .
So we &apos;ve got over 600,000 articles in English .
So this is where we get to Yochai &apos;s discussion .
It &apos;s a very unusual and chaotic thing .
We &apos;ve got over 90 servers now in three locations .
These are managed by volunteer system administrators who are online .
You could never afford to do this in a company .
And everything is managed by the volunteers .
And that &apos;s essentially our main cost .
The media has covered this somewhat extensively .
It started out with an article in Red Herring .
So how do we do this ?
How do we manage the quality control ?
How does it work ?
So real-time peer review .
And then users can set up their own personal watch list .
And we have over 40 IRC channels , 40 mailing lists .
All of that stuff is just on Wiki pages .
There &apos;s no reason to have a big argument about it .
And it also matters who the people are who are voting .
Like I say , it &apos;s a tight knit community .
So how &apos;s all this governed ?
There &apos;s a certain amount of aristocracy .
It just isn &apos;t appropriate .
Well , they managed to get 18 people to show up .
That &apos;s neo-Nazi math for you .
Thank you .
Ben Saunders : Yeah , hi , Ben Saunders .
It builds on the storyline of bloggers versus newspapers .
But I think there &apos;s going to be huge impacts .
But freely licensed textbooks are the next big thing in education .
Andrew McAfee : What will future jobs look like ?
This is the best economic news on the planet these days .
Not that there &apos;s a lot of competition , right ?
And there &apos;s actually a huge amount of truth here .
We are seeing an amazing flourishing taking place .
This is just a plain statement of the facts .
We are in the middle of an astonishing period .
Right ? Great , hang up , flourish , go home .
So this is clearly bad news for Reuther .
But the middle class is clearly under huge threat right now .
We &apos;re going to call him &quot; Ted . &quot;
He &apos;s at the top of the American middle class .
We &apos;re going to call that guy &quot; Bill . &quot;
Over time , Ted &apos;s marriage has stayed quite happy .
Bill &apos;s hasn &apos;t .
Other ways that Bill is dropping out of society ?
So the economic playbook is actually pretty straightforward .
The societal one is a lot more challenging .
I do know that education is a huge part of it .
I witnessed this firsthand .
We have to do better than this .
We cannot keep turning out Bills .
So we see some green shoots that things are getting better .
So the green shoots are out there .
We &apos;re facing very tough challenges .
We could send Congress on an autonomous car road trip .
Abraham Lincoln realized there was one other ingredient .
The great point is to give them the plain facts . &quot;
Thank you very much .
David Brooks : The social animal
But what they do have is incredible social skills .
But they have those social skills .
And he &apos;s going into a diner .
And then he describes the home he owned in their village .
And the fact is , people learn from people they love .
But that reality is expunged from our policy-making process .
It would be a big seller .
You see them on the mountains up there .
And this leads to oddities .
Now I &apos;m a middle-aged guy .
I &apos;m not exactly comfortable with emotions .
One of my favorite brain stories described these middle-aged guys .
And the brain scans were identical in both activities .
It was just sheer terror .
It tells us what to imprint .
The brain is the record of the feelings of a life .
We &apos;re social animals , not rational animals .
We are now children of the French Enlightenment .
We believe that reason is the highest of the faculties .
Babies come with this ability .
He wagged his tongue at the baby .
The baby wagged her tongue back .
Twenty percent of kids do not have those relationships .
They are what we call avoidantly attached .
They have trouble relating to other people .
So for example , we are overconfidence machines .
Ninety-five percent of our professors report that they are above-average teachers .
Ninety-six percent of college students say they have above-average social skills .
This is a gender-linked trait , by the way .
They have epistemological modesty .
They are open-minded in the face of ambiguity .
They are curious .
And these traits are often unrelated and uncorrelated with IQ .
Then you could talk about a trait like blending .
It seems so elementary .
But this is the source of innovation .
The conscious mind hungers for success and prestige .
That is what the unconscious mind hungers for .
The Greeks say we suffer our way to wisdom .
Through his suffering , Hofstadter understood how deeply interpenetrated we are .
Thank you .
Barry Schwartz : Our loss of wisdom
But what did he appeal to ?
Invest , invest , invest . &quot;
And he appealed to virtue .
Virtue is an old-fashioned word .
Let me begin with an example .
And all of the items on it are unremarkable .
Not one .
Now , not all janitors are like this , of course .
To serve other people , not to manipulate other people .
Wisdom depends on experience , and not just any experience .
And you need to be mentored by wise teachers .
At TED , brilliance is rampant .
It &apos;s scary .
Now , I hope that we all know this .
It &apos;s a story about lemonade .
So he brought it back .
And they were ready to let the kid go .
But not so fast .
The Wayne County Child Welfare Protection Agency said no .
At that point , can the child go home ?
How do things like this happen ?
Fair enough .
One tool we reach for is rules .
Better ones , more of them .
The second tool we reach for is incentives .
Better ones , more of them .
What else , after all , is there ?
Regulate , regulate , regulate .
Fix the incentives , fix the incentives , fix the incentives ...
And would you pay them a bonus for being empathic ?
It &apos;s preposterous on its face .
The lemonade story is one .
Here &apos;s an example from Chicago kindergarten .
We know why these scripts are there .
Scripts like these are insurance policies against disaster .
And they prevent disaster .
But what they assure in its place is mediocrity .
Don &apos;t get me wrong . We need rules !
We need more rules for the bankers , God knows .
But too many rules prevent accomplished jazz musicians from improvising .
Now , how about incentives ?
They seem cleverer .
Right ?
Well , not always .
I &apos;ll just give you one example because time is racing .
There was going to be a national referendum .
Astonishingly , 50 percent of the citizens said yes .
They knew it was dangerous .
They thought it would reduce their property values .
The psychologists asked other people a slightly different question .
Instead of 50 percent saying yes , 25 percent said yes .
all we ask is , &quot; What serves my interests ? &quot;
Get smarter incentives .
Any incentive system can be subverted by bad will .
We need incentives . People have to make a living .
We see this in medicine .
And we certainly see it in the world of business .
So what can we do ?
One way not to do it : teach more ethics courses .
What to do instead ?
One : Celebrate moral exemplars .
No 10-year-old goes to law school to do mergers and acquisitions .
People are inspired by moral heroes .
Well , acknowledge them .
Be proud that you have them .
Celebrate them .
That &apos;s one thing we can do .
Just at this TED we heard talks from several moral heroes .
Two were particularly inspiring to me .
Why ? Because it was the right thing to do .
His employees are inspired by the effort .
Yesterday we heard Willie Smits talk about re-foresting in Indonesia .
In many ways this is the perfect example .
Because it took the will to do the right thing .
God knows it took a huge amount of technical skill .
And you don &apos;t have to be a mega-hero .
There are ordinary heroes .
Ordinary heroes like the janitors who are worth celebrating too .
And any moral work depends upon practical wisdom .
One is that we are always teaching .
Someone is always watching .
The camera is always on .
They need to learn to respect themselves .
They need to learn to respect their schoolmates .
They need to learn to respect their teachers .
That &apos;s the principle objective .
Obama appealed to virtue .
And I think he was right .
He also appealed to hope .
Right again .
I think there is reason for hope .
I think people want to be allowed to be virtuous .
In many ways , it &apos;s what TED is all about .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
You have to go and stand out here a sec .
Barry Schwartz : Thank you very much .
Hans Rosling : Insights on HIV , in stunning data visuals
AIDS was discovered 1981 ; the virus , 1983 .
There were quite many people infected in the United States .
And , up there , you see Uganda .
And they were probably the most infected country in the world .
Now , what has happened ?
But first , I have a new invention here .
I have solidified the beam of the laser pointer .
So , ready , steady , go !
First , we have the fast rise in Uganda and Zimbabwe .
They went upwards like this .
And almost the same happens here .
25 years it took .
Now , let me make a fast replay of Botswana .
So there &apos;s some problem with these metrics now .
But focus now is back on prevention .
I would say , HIV is very different in Africa .
We have to stop that .
So , why is it so high ? Is it war ?
No , it &apos;s not . Look here .
And this is peaceful Zambia , neighboring country -- 15 percent .
So , is it poverty ?
So , this is the difference within Tanzania .
And , I can &apos;t avoid showing Kenya .
Look here at Kenya .
I &apos;ve split Kenya in its provinces .
Here it goes .
So , what is it then ?
Why do we see this extremely high levels in some countries ?
But where are they situated ?
I will swap the bubbles to a map .
HIV exists all over the world .
Look , you have bubbles all over the world here .
Brazil has many HIV-infected .
Arab countries not so much , but Iran is quite high .
They have heroin addiction and also prostitution in Iran .
India has many because they are many .
Southeast Asia , and so on .
It could be concurrency .
It could be some virus types .
But what we think is that it could be concurrency .
And what is concurrency ?
In Sweden , we have no concurrency .
We have serial monogamy .
Vodka , Midsummer &apos;s Eve -- new partner for the fall .
Vodka -- and it goes on like this , you know ?
And you collect a big number of exes .
Probably , it &apos;s a combination of this .
You can get this chart , free .
We have uploaded UNAIDS data on the Gapminder site .
Thank you very much .
Bob Mankoff : Anatomy of a New Yorker cartoon
Nobody is ever satisfied 100 percent with humor except this woman .
Bob Mankoff : That &apos;s my first wife .
That part of the relationship went fine .
Now let &apos;s look at this cartoon .
But like I said , you cannot satisfy everyone .
You couldn &apos;t satisfy this guy .
Here I &apos;m one person talking to you .
Let &apos;s look at this cartoon .
&quot; Discouraging data on the antidepressant . &quot;
Indeed , it is discouraging .
Right ? You thought it was funny .
Generally , about 85 percent of the people liked it .
But look at the individual responses .
This person rated it a two .
Other people thought it was funny .
Humor is a type of entertainment .
That &apos;s a bad zoo .
But this is a worse one .
Where is the danger going to exist ?
How are you going to manage it ?
My job is to look at 1,000 cartoons a week .
Of course , many , many cartoons must be rejected .
Cartoonists come in through the magazine every week .
But they mostly are going to be rejected .
That &apos;s the nature of any creative activity .
Many of them fade away . Some of them stay .
Matt Diffee is one of them .
Here &apos;s one of his cartoons .
Drew Dernavich . &quot; Accounting night at the improv . &quot;
And of course , that is not New Yorker humor .
What is New Yorker humor ?
This is What Lemmings Believe .
No . It &apos;s about us .
And this is my most well-known cartoon .
It &apos;s been reprinted thousands of times , totally ripped off .
In each instance , our expectations are defied .
In each instance , the narrative gets switched .
There &apos;s an incongruity and a contrast .
He is both being polite and rude .
Basically , that &apos;s the way humor works .
So I &apos;m a humor analyst , you would say .
Nobody is much interested , and the frog dies .
This guy . Who is he ? He &apos;s the critic .
Bob Mankoff : &quot; Oooh , no .
Ehhh .
Oooh . Hmm . Too funny .
Normally I would but I &apos;m in a pissy mood .
I &apos;ll enjoy it on my own . Perhaps .
No . Nah . No .
Overdrawn . Underdrawn .
Drawn just right , still not funny enough .
No . No .
For God &apos;s sake no , a thousand times no .
Office worker : Smoked turkey with bacon ? BM : No .
Eh , no .
Office worker : Grilled cheese ? BM : No .
Office worker : BLT ? BM : No .
Office worker : Green bean salad ? BM : No .
No . No .
That &apos;s sort of an exaggeration of what I do .
So I &apos;ll give you some examples of rejection collection humor .
&quot; I &apos;m thinking about having a child . &quot;
&quot; Ass-head . Please help . &quot;
I &apos;m going to explain why .
Within that context , we feel it &apos;s okay .
Within the context of The New Yorker magazine ...
So there the violation is malign . It doesn &apos;t work .
There is no such thing as funny in and of itself .
Everything will be within the context and our expectations .
One way to look at it is this .
When we &apos;re in a playful mood , we want excitement .
We want high arousal . We feel excited then .
&quot; The Rejection Collection &quot; is absolutely in this field .
You want to be stimulated . You want to be aroused .
You want to be transgressed .
It &apos;s like this , like an amusement park .
Voice : Here we go .
This is another cartoon from &quot; The Rejection Collection . &quot;
&quot; Too snug ? &quot;
That &apos;s a cartoon about terrorism .
The New Yorker occupies a very different space .
How would The New Yorker attack it ?
Better left undrawn .
The first week we did no cartoons .
That was a black hole for humor , and correctly so .
It &apos;s not always appropriate every time .
But the next week , this was the first cartoon .
We were going to exist . Here &apos;s another one .
These cartoons are not about them . They &apos;re about us .
The humor reflects back on us .
It &apos;s called dispositional humor .
Here &apos;s another cartoon .
Humor does need a target .
The target is the readership and the people who do it .
The humor is self-reflective and makes us think about our assumptions .
That is a deeply profound cartoon .
Different frames of reference .
&quot; You slept with her , didn &apos;t you ? &quot;
&quot; Lassie ! Get help ! ! &quot;
It &apos;s called French Army Knife .
Now there are some cartoons that are puzzling .
Like , this cartoon would puzzle many people .
How many people know what this cartoon means ?
The dog is signaling he wants to go for a walk .
This is the signal for a catcher to walk the dog .
It &apos;s sort of a smorgasbord that &apos;s made all interesting .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Robert Full : Learning from the gecko &apos;s tail
Let me share with you today an original discovery .
These are gecko toes .
And the individual has 2 billion of these nano-size split ends .
They don &apos;t stick by Velcro or suction or glue .
And here is its first test .
More recently , this happened .
This the first time someone has actually climbed with it .
How do you know ?
Lynn Verinsky : Because of liability insurance .
Robert Full : That &apos;s what she did on rough surfaces .
Here is the actual robot .
And here is what it does .
There it is .
So what they did was they asked us an important question .
Even though we put a passive bar there .
We said , &quot; Well , what do tails do ? &quot;
Well we know that tails store fat , for example .
We know that you can grab onto things with them .
It can also act as a counterbalance .
So watch this kangaroo .
See that tail ? That &apos;s incredible !
Marc Raibert built a Uniroo hopping robot .
And it was unstable without its tail .
But of course , this is a passive tail .
And you can also have active tails .
Myhrvold thinks tail-cracking dinosaurs were interested in love , not war .
It can also be used in defense .
Pretty powerful .
So we then went back and looked at the animal .
And we ran it up a surface .
So here is normal speed .
This is incredible .
The engineers had a really good idea .
They &apos;re climbing up a wall , or a tree .
And we did that experiment , that you see here .
And this is what we discovered .
Now that &apos;s real time . You can &apos;t see anything .
But there it is slowed down .
What we discovered was the world &apos;s fastest air-righting response .
But geckos do it better .
And they do it with their tail .
If we could have the lights on it .
Okay , there it goes .
And show the video .
There it is .
And it works just like it does in the animal .
So we did . And here is what it does .
It does an equilibrium glide . Highly controlled .
So we can maneuver this way .
It oscillates its tail up and down like a dolphin .
It can actually swim through the air .
What does that mean for the origin of flapping flight ?
Stay tuned for that .
And it certainly looks like it .
You can see it even better from down on top .
Watch the animal .
Definitely moving towards the landing target .
It &apos;s unbelievable .
We wondered , &quot; Do they actually glide in nature ? &quot;
Well we went to the forests of Singapore and Southeast Asia .
Look at the end to see the animal .
You see it there ? There ? Watch it come down .
Naomi Klein : Addicted to risk
I just did something I &apos;ve never done before .
I spent a week at sea on a research vessel .
This is the boat we were on , by the way .
It &apos;s still working its way up the food chain .
Now this shouldn &apos;t come as a surprise to us .
Thus the title &quot; Silent Spring . &quot;
Better to err on the side of caution .
Another explanation that you often hear for recklessness is hubris .
And you actually don &apos;t have a lot of options .
Don &apos;t feel ashamed .
Here &apos;s what I &apos;m talking about .
Let &apos;s hear from Tony Hayward again .
&quot; The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean .
A new bubble will replace the old one .
Now the problem is that the story was always a lie .
The Earth always did have limits .
They were just beyond our sights .
And now we are hitting those limits on multiple fronts .
How else to explain the cultural space occupied by Sarah Palin ?
The twin message is as comforting as it is mad .
Ignore those creeping fears that we have finally hit the wall .
There are still no limits .
There will always be another frontier .
So stop worrying and keep shopping .
This assessment , unfortunately , is far too optimistic .
And most controversially , it means the tar sands .
The oil is not liquid .
You can &apos;t just drill a hole and pump it out .
That &apos;s a person down there by the wheel .
My point is that this is not oil drilling .
It &apos;s not even mining .
It is terrestrial skinning .
Vast , vivid landscapes are being gutted , left monochromatic gray .
But , of course , our secular religion is technology .
So , solving the problem of pollution with more pollution .
Think of it as the ultimate junk shot .
An escape hatch has been reached .
A new frontier has been found .
We badly need some new stories .
That this is our only home .
There is no escape hatch .
Thank you .
Christoph Adami : Finding life we can &apos;t imagine
So I have a strange career .
No , no , I wasn &apos;t 14 years old .
But I &apos;m going to tell you about something else today .
And I was actually a rocket scientist .
But it was an exciting experience .
Yet , I had a very good answer .
I said , &quot; I have no idea . &quot;
And I said , &quot; What is that ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Really ?
Because isn &apos;t that easy ?
I mean , we have life .
But here &apos;s something . &quot;
And then you see something like that .
Anyone know ?
It &apos;s actually not life , it &apos;s a crystal .
Except that nowadays , it &apos;s heavily disputed .
So can life be defined ?
Well how would you go about it ?
And then you might get something .
And then you might come up with something like this .
And it says something complicated with lots and lots of concepts .
Why ? Because these things don &apos;t evolve by themselves .
In fact , they have hackers writing them .
And this was Steen Rasmussen .
But what is this system like ?
There &apos;s about 10,000 programs sitting here .
And all different strains are colored in different colors .
And this process goes on and on and on .
Can we measure this type of life ?
It &apos;s a robust signature , and it &apos;s very stable .
And here &apos;s the result .
So this also turns out to be extremely robust .
And it is detectable not just in amino acids .
Now you could ask : well , what about these Avidians ?
They have about 28 of these instructions .
Each of these instructions appears with roughly the equal frequency .
In this case , the frequency is lower .
So let &apos;s see what that looks like .
So first , nothing , nothing , nothing .
Too hot , too hot .
And of course , it reaches the viability threshold .
You hit the viability threshold .
The distribution changes to &quot; alive ! &quot;
And then that signature is lost .
What do we learn from that ?
And if you can do that , then you have life .
And I &apos;m going to leave you with that .
And thank you very much .
Jonas Gahr Støre : In defense of dialogue
And I can tell you , our agenda is full .
We loosely call them &quot; groups . &quot;
And we struggle with how to deal with them .
The red is modern conflict , conflicts within states .
So in a way , it is everybody &apos;s business .
They need political solutions .
And we have among states a reluctance in dealing with them .
It was black or white .
And groups are very often immediately label terrorists .
And who would talk to terrorists ?
Now I &apos;m not naive .
You cannot talk to everybody all the time .
And there are times you should walk .
And sometimes military intervention is necessary .
Let us turn to Afghanistan .
The situation , to be honest , is very serious .
We just have to persevere . &quot;
We can only solve this through a political solution .
Everybody seems to agree with that .
Now everybody agrees .
Because we didn &apos;t talk .
We didn &apos;t grasp what was going on .
And you can always walk .
It &apos;s hard , but it is necessary .
Let me go one step further .
This is Tahrir Square .
There &apos;s a revolution going on .
It will last for a long , long time .
And who knows what it will be called in the end .
That &apos;s not the point .
Social groups are taking to the streets .
Because we never talk to the people in these countries .
Should we talk to Hamas ?
If we talk to them , we may legitimize them . &quot;
I think that is wrong .
Because they may turn out to be a majority .
How will we ever be interlocutors ?
Now my diplomats are instructed to talk to all these groups .
But talking can be done in different ways .
Now talking can be accompanied with aid or not with aid .
Talking can be accompanied with inclusion or not inclusion .
It &apos;s their right to fight . &quot;
Now as you know , Mandela didn &apos;t do that .
Now South African friends will know that was very painful .
So what can we learn from all of this ?
We have to connect with these profound changes .
And what is dialogue really about ?
Sometimes you have to .
But that strategy seldom takes you very far .
The alternative is a strategy of engagement and principled dialogue .
We are seeing some new signs .
And they brought their knowledge .
This is perhaps a first element of a change .
We as diplomats need to know the social capital of communities .
The good thing is that we are not powerless .
Thank you for your attention .
Arianna Huffington : How to succeed ? Get more sleep
And my little idea that will do that is sleep .
This is a room of type-A women .
This is a room of sleep-deprived women .
And I learned the hard way , the value of sleep .
Two-and-a-half years ago , I fainted from exhaustion .
And I began the journey of rediscovering the value of sleep .
There is now a kind of sleep deprivation one-upmanship .
So a high I.Q.
And we &apos;ve had far too many icebergs hitting our Titanics .
Thank you .
Ahn Trio : A modern take on piano , violin , cello
Angella Ahn : Thank you .
Thank you so much .
What an exciting and inspiring event .
What you just heard is &quot; Skylife &quot; by David Balakrishnan .
We want to play you one more selection .
It &apos;s by Astor Piazzolla , an Argentine composer .
It was more atonal and twelve-tone .
And he insisted on beautiful music .
So this is &quot; Oblivion &quot; by Astor Piazzolla .
Thank you .
Arthur Benjamin : The magic of Fibonacci numbers
So why do we learn mathematics ?
Yeah ! I already have Fibonacci fans here .
That &apos;s great .
Now these numbers can be appreciated in many different ways .
Let me show you one of my favorites .
That &apos;s how they &apos;re created .
But check this out .
In fact , here &apos;s another one .
Let &apos;s see what we get there .
So one plus one plus four is six .
Add nine to that , we get 15 .
Add 25 , we get 40 .
Add 64 , we get 104 .
Now look at those numbers .
Do you see it ? I &apos;ll show it to you .
Fibonacci ! Of course .
Let &apos;s look at that last equation .
I &apos;ll show you by drawing a simple picture .
Together , they form a one-by-two rectangle .
Just as we created it .
That &apos;s the area .
So the area is also eight times 13 .
Now check this out .
If you divide 13 by eight , you get 1.625 .
Thank you very much .
Don Tapscott : Four principles for the open world
Openness . It &apos;s a word that denotes opportunity and possibilities .
Why is this happening ?
The technology revolution is opening the world .
Yesterday &apos;s Internet was a platform for the presentation of content .
The Internet of today is a platform for computation .
Collaboration can occur on an astronomical basis .
Now a new generation is opening up the world as well .
I call them the Net Generation .
I said , these kids are different .
It &apos;s like the air .
I &apos;m a digital immigrant .
I had to learn the language .
The global economic crisis is opening up the world as well .
I mean , think about Wall Street .
Now , what is openness ?
The first is collaboration .
His name is Rob McEwen .
I &apos;ve read some of your books . &quot;
I said , &quot; Great . What do you do ? &quot;
And he tells me this amazing story .
So he does a &quot; radical &quot; thing .
He gets submissions from all around the world .
You know , conventional wisdom says talent is inside , right ?
Your most precious asset goes out the elevator every night .
He viewed talent differently .
He wondered , who are their peers ?
They came from computer scientists , engineers .
He helped us understand that social media &apos;s becoming social production .
It &apos;s not about hooking up online .
This is a new means of production in the making .
Openness is about collaboration .
Now secondly , openness is about transparency .
And everywhere , our institutions are becoming naked .
I mean , one is , fitness is no longer optional .
You say you have good products .
They &apos;d better be good .
But you also need to have values .
So this is good . It &apos;s not bad .
Sunlight is the best disinfectant .
And we need a lot of sunlight in this troubled world .
Now this is different than transparency .
Transparency is about the communication of information .
Sharing is about giving up assets , intellectual property .
And there are all kinds of famous stories about this .
So we need to think differently about intellectual property .
I &apos;ll give you an example .
The pharmaceutical industry is in deep trouble .
Do you know about this ?
We need to reinvent the whole model of scientific research .
And I &apos;m not talking about the motherhood sense here .
The open world is bringing freedom .
Now , take the Arab Spring .
You know , one word : Tunisia .
You think that social media is about hooking up online ?
It was a tool of self-defense .
So this is a time of great change .
Now , it &apos;s not without its problems .
You can see this playing out today in Egypt .
But that doesn &apos;t matter , because this is moving forward .
The toothpaste is out of the tube .
I mean , we &apos;re not putting this one back .
The open world is bringing empowerment and freedom .
People didn &apos;t know about things .
There was no concept of progress .
You were born , you lived your life and you died .
So we saw the Protestant Reformation .
But it came with a cost .
The printing press gave us access to the written word .
The Internet enables each of us to be a producer .
The printing press gave us access to recorded knowledge .
Now , this thing has a function .
It protects the birds .
And there &apos;s leadership , but there &apos;s no one leader .
This is a huge collaboration .
Could we go beyond just sharing information and knowledge ?
Could we start to share our intelligence ?
Let &apos;s do this . Thank you .
Julian Treasure : The 4 ways sound affects us
First is physiological .
It &apos;s not just unpleasant sounds like that that do it .
This is surf .
It has the frequency of roughly 12 cycles per minute .
There is a deep resonance with being at rest .
We also associate it with being stress-free and on holiday .
The second way in which sound affects you is psychological .
Natural sound can do that too .
It &apos;s when they stop you need to be worried .
The third way in which sound affects you is cognitively .
Try and listen to the other one .
The fourth way in which sound affects us is behaviorally .
And that &apos;s not the only thing that bad sound damages .
At last we &apos;ve got some science we can apply .
And we &apos;re in the business of designing soundscapes .
I &apos;ll give you two examples .
Most of you recognize that immediately .
The younger , maybe not .
And most of you associate that with something !
Now , those are one-second samples of music .
There are eight expressions of a brand in sound .
I &apos;m glad to say that is starting to happen now .
1.8 billion times a day , that tune is played .
And it cost Nokia absolutely nothing .
That increases impact by over 1,100 percent .
That &apos;s an order of magnitude , up or down .
This is important .
Secondly , make it appropriate to the situation .
Don &apos;t just bombard them with stuff .
And , finally , test and test it again .
Sound is complex . There are many countervailing influences .
So I hope this talk has raised sound in your consciousness .
Thank you for lending me your ears today .
Christopher McDougall : Are we born to run ?
That &apos;s her competition .
She &apos;s under the underdogs .
Now this is when something really bizarre happens .
Derartu Tulu ruins the script .
So Paula Radcliffe , unfortunately , does it .
But then she falls back again .
Now the Tarahumara are remarkable for three things .
The Tarahumara had a different strategy .
They are free from all of these modern ailments .
So what &apos;s the connection ?
They &apos;re trying to solve those same kinds of mysteries .
Australopithecus had a tiny little pea brain .
We &apos;re not fast .
For some reason you guys are just really slow .
Her uterus would be torn .
Yes . You would have torn reproductive organs .
I &apos;ll give you an example .
They give you 48 hours to finish this race .
So you have these three mysteries .
Maybe we evolved as a hunting pack animal .
We &apos;re really good at being sweaty and smelly .
So what if we evolved as hunting pack animals ?
That &apos;s all we could do .
We could run really far on a hot day .
You need a pack to pull together .
The herd explodes and it gathers back again .
Those expert trackers have got to be part of the pack .
They can &apos;t be 10 miles behind .
They need to be part of the pack .
The pack stays together .
But maybe it &apos;s something different .
We try to cash in on it .
I didn &apos;t do yoga . I &apos;m not ready . &quot;
Humans ran and ran all the time .
We are here today . We have our digital technology .
So how do we get back to that again ?
Get rid of all the stinking running shoes .
So what &apos;s the benefit ? So what ?
So you burn off the Haagen-Dazs from the night before ?
But maybe there &apos;s another benefit there as well .
I &apos;ve experienced it personally myself .
So hopefully it &apos;s something we can all benefit from .
Jessa Gamble : Our natural sleep cycle
Let &apos;s start with day and night .
So , we have this ability as well .
So , what would our natural rhythm look like ?
They go to bed around 8 : 00 p.m.
So , cut to the modern day .
Thank you .
Maajid Nawaz : A global culture to fight extremism
or &quot; How could we have better prepared for that ? &quot;
In medieval societies there were defined allegiances .
An identity was defined primarily by religion .
In the age of globalization , we moved on .
And that &apos;s something which I &apos;d like to elaborate on .
We felt they were from the age of yesteryear .
We felt that they were out of date .
I learned how to effectively communicate across borders without being detected .
Eventually I was detected , of course , in Egypt .
And it &apos;s not just Islamist extremists that did this .
In certain countries , mosque minarets are being banned .
In others , headscarves are being banned .
Now that never would have been possible before .
Where does that leave democracy aspirants ?
Well I believe they &apos;re getting left far behind .
And I &apos;ll give you an example here at this stage .
So why are they succeeding ?
And why are democracy aspirants falling behind ?
It &apos;s comprised of ideas and narratives and symbols and leaders .
One of their leaders was killed in Pakistan recently .
So these symbols and these leaders come to your mind immediately .
And that &apos;s the power of social movements .
So that begs the next question .
And I believe that &apos;s for four reasons .
I believe , number one , it &apos;s complacency .
The second , I believe , is political correctness .
Let &apos;s bring the military back again . &quot;
Is it just about grievances ?
Is it just about a lack of education ?
And this is where I believe neoconservatism had it upside-down .
Now to conclude , how does that happen ?
Well , Egypt is a good starting point .
The Arab uprisings have demonstrated that this is already beginning .
We need to move one step beyond that now .
And it &apos;s with that thought that I &apos;ll end .
Susan Lim : Transplant cells , not organs
in the following year .
Next , raising the money to fund the procedure .
The transplant community has actively campaigned in organ donation .
Where and how can we draw the line ?
I was also pregnant at the time .
And in transplantation , concepts shifted from whole organs to cells .
I witnessed the technical difficulty .
Fat-derived stem cells are adult stem cells .
But adult stem cells are not embryonic stem cells .
In May 2006 , something horrible happened to me .
What lies ahead ?
Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide .
1.1 million Americans suffer heart attacks yearly .
4.8 million suffer cardiac failure .
Powerful new technologies always present enigmas .
Each one has his story .
Thank you .
Arvind Gupta : Turning trash into toys for learning
My name is Arvind Gupta , and I &apos;m a toymaker .
I &apos;ve been making toys for the last 30 years .
The early &apos; 70s , I was in college .
It was a very revolutionary time .
The National Movement of India was testimony to that .
So he designed and went and started a village science program .
Many people were inspired by this .
Live with them ; love them .
This was kind of the defining slogan .
Well I took one year .
And it was a turning point .
And one thing which I found was this black rubber .
This is called a cycle valve tube .
It &apos;s like its own little coupling .
And they have some wonderful properties .
You can just pull this out , this becomes a rectangle .
You give it a push , this becomes a parallelogram .
But this is very shaky .
Push it and it becomes house shaped .
This becomes an isosceles triangle -- again , very shaky .
This square might look very square and prim .
Give it a little push -- this becomes a rhombus .
It becomes kite-shaped .
Why use triangles ?
Because triangles are the only rigid structures .
They always make a triangular roof .
Now this is people science .
So you make all these 3D shapes .
You make a tetrahedron like this .
And once you make these , you make a little house .
Put this on top .
You just need a ton .
You can play around with it .
This makes an igloo .
Now this is in 1978 .
I was a 24-year-old young engineer .
And I thought this was so much better than making trucks .
I see hope . I see happiness in their faces .
Children want to make things . Children want to do things .
Now this , we make lots and lots of pumps .
And this is how you make a valve .
You put a little sticky tape .
This is one-way traffic .
Well we make lots and lots of pumps .
And this is the pump .
It &apos;s like a centrifuge .
If you spin something , it tends to fly out .
Many of our folk toys have great science principles .
If you spin-top something , it tends to fly out .
Right .
There are four pictures .
But this is great fun for children .
They all study about the food chain .
In three minutes , you just fold this up .
With a bigger one , you make a bigger one .
Now this is a pencil with a few slots over here .
And you put a little fan here .
And this is a hundred-year-old toy .
There have been six major research papers on this .
There &apos;s some grooves over here , you can see .
Six major research papers on this .
He wrote a paper on this .
This is a straw .
This is a kind of a blowing straw .
I just put this inside this .
There &apos;s a hole here , and I shut this .
What we do is make a very simple electric motor .
Now this is the simplest motor on Earth .
The most expensive thing is the battery inside this .
This is a permanent magnet .
Whenever current flows through the coil , this becomes an electromagnet .
We made 30,000 .
When teachers make it , children make it .
You can see a gleam in their eye .
They get a thrill of what science is all about .
And this science is not a rich man &apos;s game .
Over 100,000 children learn science this way .
And we &apos;re just trying to see possibilities .
They are fused together , so you can &apos;t separate them .
You put this in your mouth , and you blow .
And something very , very nice happens .
This is a touching slate meant for blind children .
And this is wool over here .
If I crank the handle , all the wool goes inside .
Wool sticks on Velcro .
And this has come as a great boon to them .
But this has come as a great boon for them .
There are no patents . Anyone can make it .
This is very , very simple .
These are two magnets .
Small pulley and two strong magnets .
And this fiber turns a wire attached to an LED .
There will be a spinning magnetic field .
And you can see , this LED is going to glow .
So this is a small crank generator .
And they &apos;d be absolutely joyous playing with this .
we use a lot of old newspapers to make caps .
This is worthy of Sachin Tendulkar .
It &apos;s a great cricket cap .
And you can see , this is a little fantail bird .
This is called &quot; The Captain &apos;s Hat Story . &quot;
The captain was a captain of a sea-going ship .
It goes very slowly .
It &apos;s been catapulted to international glory .
So that &apos;s a ship .
They were singing and dancing .
Suddenly there was a storm and huge waves .
And there &apos;s a third one over here .
This swallows the bridge and knocks it down .
Thank you so much .
Why are we so bad at detecting pancreatic cancer ?
That &apos;s older than my dad .
That &apos;s next to impossible .
I got everything for my homework from those two sources .
They &apos;re kind of like the superheroes of material science .
However , there &apos;s a catch .
So that &apos;s why I chose to use paper .
I can &apos;t really do cancer research on my kitchen countertop .
My mom wouldn &apos;t really like that .
So instead , I decided to go for a lab .
You &apos;re going to save us all ! &quot;
However , there was a silver lining .
So I went in that direction .
As you can never say no to a kid .
How unlikely is that ? I mean , pshhh .
But it wouldn &apos;t stop there .
It &apos;s just your ideas that count .
You could be changing the world .
Thank you .
Shereen El Feki : Pop culture in the Arab world
Yes . That &apos;s right . This is Barbie .
They have different interests . They have divergent values .
And should they ever come in contact ...
I want to show you two examples .
The first is 4Shbab .
: Video clips from across the globe .
The USA .
And they look something like this .
But it &apos;s not about fire and brimstone either .
Now , my second example is for a slightly younger crowd .
And it &apos;s called &quot; The 99 . &quot;
Now , these are the world &apos;s first Islamic superheroes .
They were created by a Kuwaiti psychologist called Naif Al Mutawa .
So , for example , there is the character of Noora .
Another character called Jami has the ability to create fantastic inventions .
It &apos;s now a theme park .
There is an animated series in the works .
We &apos;re not talking here about a clash of civilizations .
Nor is it some sort of indistinguishable mash .
Adam Grosser : A mobile fridge for vaccines
This is a problem .
Time for some thermodynamics .
And the story of the Intermittent Absorption Refrigerator .
It &apos;s one of those things that stuck in my head .
There &apos;s two spheres and they &apos;re separated in distance .
You heat up one side , the hot side .
The ammonia evaporates and it re-condenses in the other side .
But it was kind of an interesting thought .
We proved that most of the ammonia refrigeration tables are wrong .
So , this is the way it works .
You put it on a cooking fire .
Thank you .
David Cameron : The next age of government
And someone asked , &quot; Why ? &quot;
We have vast budget deficits .
That &apos;s the argument I want to make tonight .
So , starting with the political philosophy .
Of course we don &apos;t .
Local power , central power , now , people power .
So this was the pre-bureaucratic age .
Suddenly , you have the big , strong , central state .
It had sucked all that power up from the localities .
It was able to do that itself .
So , how could this happen ?
So , complete transparency will make a huge difference .
And the third of these big changes : accountability .
This , I think , is a huge change .
We &apos;re working with some of these people .
We want to get people to be more energy efficient .
How do you do it ?
I don &apos;t think they lasted very long .
Other examples are recycling .
We all know we need to recycle more .
How do we make it happen ?
So what does all this add up to ?
Thank you .
Charles Hazlewood : Trusting the ensemble
My job depends upon it .
That &apos;s all I have at the point of sale .
It &apos;s silent gesture .
I can hardly bark out instructions while we &apos;re playing .
Ladies and gentlemen , the Scottish Ensemble .
You overcompensate .
And in my game , that means you overgesticulate .
You end up like some kind of rabid windmill .
Bugger me , they wouldn &apos;t give it to me .
If you hold it too tightly , you crush it .
If you hold it too loosely , it flies away . &quot;
Let &apos;s be under no illusions .
So how do we recover from that , ladies and gentlemen ?
Simply through singing .
One of them was &quot; Carmen . &quot;
South Africans just make music really freely .
They don &apos;t read music .
They trust their ears .
Why is this ?
Did you know that TED is a tune ?
Now hang on a minute .
T , see it &apos;s the same as F in music .
So T is F.
Have a listen .
Do you hear it ?
Or do I smell some doubt in the room ?
If you &apos;ll pardon the expression .
I think we should make this even more explicit .
Ladies and gentlemen , it &apos;s nearly time for tea .
I think we need to sing for our tea .
Will you have a go for me ?
Audience : T , E , D.
Shall we try that one again ?
T , E , D.
Audience : T , E , D.
CH : Once more with vim .
There I am like a bloody windmill again , you see .
One more time , with feeling , ladies and gentlemen .
You won &apos;t make the key otherwise .
Well done , ladies and gentlemen .
So I decided to create a platform for that potential .
It &apos;s called Paraorchestra .
It was a really extraordinary moment .
Just me and four astonishingly gifted disabled musicians .
No one &apos;s listening . No one &apos;s trusting .
No one &apos;s responding to each other .
Nicholas : : My name &apos;s Nicholas McCarthy .
I &apos;m 22 , and I &apos;m a left-handed pianist .
And I was born without my left hand -- right hand .
Can I do that one again ?
I become alive .
It &apos;s removed some of my paralysis .
Paraorchestra is the name of that project .
You can imagine , the musicians were disconsolate .
Haydn remonstrated with the prince , but to no avail .
Courtney Martin : This isn &apos;t her mother &apos;s feminism
Thank you . Thank you for hip-hop -- and Anita Hill .
My parents were radicals -- who became , well , grown-ups .
I was raised with a very heavy sense of unfinished legacy .
Feminism was the water I grew up in .
You can see how this had an influence .
But she was not the only feminist in the house .
He &apos;s actually here today .
They were the co-authors of a book called &quot; Manifesta . &quot;
Fishnet stockings .
Jennifer Baumgardner was wearing them .
I thought they were really hot .
I decided , okay , I can claim the feminist label .
Anyone heard of these two guys as an example ?
My mom says , &quot; patriarchy . &quot;
I say , &quot; intersectionality . &quot;
Pay equity ? Yes . Absolutely a feminist issue .
But for me , so is immigration .
Thank you .
My mom says , &quot; Protest march . &quot;
I say , &quot; Online organizing . &quot;
Feminist blogging is basically the 21st century version of consciousness raising .
But we also have a straightforward political impact .
I realized feminism wasn &apos;t about man-hating and Birkenstocks . &quot;
My mom says , &quot; Gloria Steinem . &quot;
We don &apos;t want one hero .
We don &apos;t want one icon .
We don &apos;t want one face .
Thank you .
These are three words many of us were raised with .
It &apos;s enough to make you feel very overwhelmed .
Which brings me to my third paradox .
I wrote the book I needed to read .
Instead , what she really wanted to do was make films .
Cornel West says , &quot; Of course it &apos;s a failure .
But how good a failure is it ? &quot;
It &apos;s to say we operate on two levels .
It &apos;s about embracing the paradox .
It &apos;s about acting in the face of overwhelm .
And it &apos;s about loving people really well .
Thank you .
Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy : Inside a school for suicide bombers
In 2009 , there were 500 bomb blasts across Pakistan .
The Taliban now run their own schools .
We &apos;ve obtained a propaganda video made by the Taliban .
Hazrat Ali is from a poor farming family in Swat .
He joined the Taliban a year ago when he was 13 .
They ask us to use them only against the infidels .
Then they teach us to do a suicide attack .
SOC : Would you like to carry out a suicide attack ?
H If God gives me strength .
Effectively , this is the brainwashing process that has begun .
Now these children are primed to become suicide bombers .
I want you to watch another excerpt from the film .
This boy is called Zenola .
He blew himself up , killing six .
This boy is called Sadik .
He killed 22 .
This boy is called Messoud .
He killed 28 .
Do you want to carry out a suicide attack ?
Boy : I would love to .
But only if I get permission from my dad .
I have laid down my life fighting the infidels . &quot;
Then God will look at my intention .
Thank you .
So it is a one-company town .
And Electrolux was going to go to Mexico .
In fact , they did implode the factory .
I went from high school to factory .
My father worked at this factory , &quot; he said .
&quot; My grandfather worked at this factory .
All I know is how to make refrigerators . &quot;
Who is ever going to hire me ? &quot;
We got a problem , folks .
So it got me thinking , what is it ?
As we know , only half the states have opted in .
Because they see our passivity as their opportunity .
It &apos;s a rounding error on the federal side .
Why not ask all of the states to do that instead ?
In fact , every region of the country could do this .
Because Republican and Democratic governors love to cut ribbons .
We want to bring jobs . I &apos;m just saying .
Congress putting four and a half billion dollars on the table ?
They can &apos;t agree to anything . &quot;
Or , you renegades , we could go around Congress .
Go around Congress .
What if we created a private sector challenge to the governors ?
What if it all started here at TED ?
And we can get in the game or not .
Thank you all so much .
Alex Steffen : The route to a sustainable future
Fill in the blanks .
So , you know , sustainability , small planet .
Right ? Picture a little Earth , circling around the sun .
One of them is that every society has an ecological footprint .
We &apos;re using up about five planets .
Clearly we don &apos;t have 10 planets .
We don &apos;t have that . So that &apos;s one problem .
And people simply do not have enough to survive .
A third of the people on this planet are kids .
And they may not want to live exactly like us .
Everybody in this room has heard the worst-case scenarios .
I don &apos;t need to go into that .
But I will ask the question , what &apos;s the alternative ?
We don &apos;t know how to do this yet .
So what &apos;s Worldchanging ?
Talk about the kinds of things we &apos;re scoping out .
Give you a little peek into our editorial notebook .
So you have density . You also have growth management .
You leave aside what is natural to be natural .
This is in Portland . That is an actual development .
That land there will remain pasture in perpetuity .
They &apos;ve bounded the city with a line .
Nature , city . Nothing changes .
You can also start to change what you build .
You can start to know where things are .
When you share them , you end up using less .
We could just re-label things .
How we build things can change as well .
This is a bio-morphic building .
It takes its inspiration in form from life .
We &apos;re starting to cover this more and more .
So this , for example , is hydrogen-generating algae .
They live in the emerging megacities of the developing world .
It &apos;s every seven days .
Most of those cites are growing incredibly quickly .
So I rather like this picture here .
And those things lead to things like this .
This is a Telecentro in Sao Paulo .
I particularly like the little Linux penguin in the back .
It &apos;s doing something new . There &apos;s new things happening .
Another world is possible .
We tweak that a lot .
How many people knew of Lula before today ?
I would keep your eye on this fellow .
You get -- this is a building in Hyderabad , India .
It &apos;s the greenest building in the world .
You get access to distance medicine .
You get new tools for people in the developing world .
Here &apos;s a design for distilling water using sunlight .
Here &apos;s a way of transporting water .
I mean , that &apos;s a great design .
This is a fabulous invention , LifeStraw .
This is one of my favorite Worldchanging kinds of things ever .
How do we help people like that ?
New models for pedagogy for the displaced .
And we have new tools .
This is one of my absolute favorite things anywhere .
Does anyone know what this is ?
Audience : It detects landmines .
Alex Steffen : Exactly , this is a landmine-detecting flower .
You know , that it &apos;s not just enough to survive .
And I think that we will .
I hope that that turns out to be true .
Thank you very much .
Rives : A story of mixed emoticons
This means , &quot; I &apos;m smiling . &quot;
So does that .
This means &quot; mouse . &quot;
&quot; Cat . &quot;
Here we have a story .
Here &apos;s where it happens .
These are when .
She wears it every day .
Look at her posture ; it &apos;s remarkable .
That &apos;s because she dances .
And he could say , &quot; Oh my God ! &quot;
or &quot; I heart you ! &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m laughing out loud . &quot;
&quot; I want to give you a hug . &quot;
But he comes up with that , you know .
Put a crab inside it .
Add some water .
Seven different salts .
And the girl goes , &quot; Wha &apos; ? &quot;
I think my heartbeat might be the Morse code for inappropriate .
At least , that &apos;s how it seems .
I &apos;m a monkey -- -- blowing kisses at a butterfly .
But I &apos;m still suggesting you and I should meet .
First , soon , and then a lot .
Hell , ponytail alone .
I don &apos;t know what else to tell you .
I got a pencil you can borrow .
You can put it in your phone . &quot;
She just says , &quot; No thank you . &quot;
You know ?
Pamela Meyer : How to spot a liar
Also , the person to your left is a liar .
Also the person sitting in your very seats is a liar .
We &apos;re all liars .
I can &apos;t even get a coffee date at Starbucks .
My husband &apos;s like , &quot; Honey , deception ?
Your eyebrow twitched . You flared your nostril .
Its power emerges when someone else agrees to believe the lie .
Truth number one about lying : Lying &apos;s a cooperative act .
Now not all lies are harmful .
We say , &quot; Nice song . &quot;
So sorry . &quot;
But there are times when we are unwilling participants in deception .
And that can have dramatic costs for us .
That &apos;s an eyelash under a trillion dollars .
That &apos;s seven percent of revenues .
Deception can cost billions .
Think Enron , Madoff , the mortgage crisis .
Deception is actually serious business .
He was interviewed once , and he said the following .
And that &apos;s the crux of it .
And we all kind of hate to admit it .
Now granted , many of those are white lies .
Now when we first hear this data , we recoil .
We can &apos;t believe how prevalent lying is .
We &apos;re essentially against lying .
But if you look more closely , the plot actually thickens .
We lie more to strangers than we lie to coworkers .
Extroverts lie more than introverts .
Women lie more to protect other people .
Now you may think that &apos;s bad .
If you &apos;re unmarried , that number drops to three .
Lying &apos;s complex .
We &apos;re deeply ambivalent about the truth .
That &apos;s truth number two about lying .
It &apos;s as old as breathing .
Lying has evolutionary value to us as a species .
Now you might remember Koko .
Does anybody remember Koko the gorilla who was taught sign language ?
Koko was taught to communicate via sign language .
Here &apos;s Koko with her kitten .
It &apos;s her cute little , fluffy pet kitten .
We &apos;re hardwired to become leaders of the pack .
It &apos;s starts really , really early .
How early ?
One-year-olds learn concealment .
Two-year-olds bluff .
Five-year-olds lie outright .
They manipulate via flattery .
Nine-year-olds , masters of the cover up .
It &apos;s been very confusing for a long time now .
What do you do ?
Trained liespotters get to the truth 90 percent of the time .
The rest of us , we &apos;re only 54 percent accurate .
Why is it so easy to learn ?
We &apos;re going to start with speech .
Bill Clinton : I want you to listen to me .
I &apos;m going to say this again .
And these allegations are false .
Thank you .
Pamela Meyer : Okay , what were the telltale signs ?
Well first we heard what &apos;s known as a non-contracted denial .
We also heard distancing language : &quot; that woman . &quot;
Freud had it right .
And we all do it no matter how powerful you are .
We all chatter with our fingertips .
Let the science temper your knowledge a little bit .
Because we think liars fidget all the time .
We think liars won &apos;t look you in the eyes .
We think warmth and smiles convey honesty , sincerity .
Can you all spot the fake smile here ?
You can consciously contract the muscles in your cheeks .
Now we &apos;re going to look at the hot spots .
Can you tell what &apos;s happening in a conversation ?
An honest person is going to be cooperative .
They &apos;re going to show they &apos;re on your side .
They &apos;re going to be enthusiastic .
We rehearse our words , but we rarely rehearse our gestures .
We tell very convincing stories , we slightly shrug our shoulders .
John Edwards : I &apos;d be happy to participate in one .
So I know it &apos;s not possible .
But I &apos;m happy to participate in one .
Murderers are known to leak sadness .
It &apos;s still somewhat of a healthy relationship .
But when anger turns to contempt , you &apos;ve been dismissed .
It &apos;s associated with moral superiority .
Here &apos;s what it looks like .
It &apos;s marked by one lip corner pulled up and in .
It &apos;s the only asymmetrical expression .
Science has surfaced many , many more indicators .
Now here &apos;s the deal .
These behaviors are just behaviors .
They &apos;re not proof of deception .
They &apos;re red flags .
We &apos;re human beings .
They don &apos;t mean anything in and of themselves .
Don &apos;t be too aggressive , it doesn &apos;t work .
And these were surfaced by researcher David Matsumoto in California .
That bothers me the most .
And she fought , and I know she fought you .
And I don &apos;t understand it , and I never will .
Liespotters rely on human tools .
Our world is lit up 24 hours a day .
It &apos;s a much more noisy world .
And that &apos;s the truth . Thank you .
Apollo Robbins : The art of misdirection
Do you think it &apos;s possible to control someone &apos;s attention ?
Even more than that , what about predicting human behavior ?
I think those are interesting ideas , if you could .
Great . Double-check .
Make sure you still have them on you .
I was doing some shopping beforehand .
You just looked at your clock , right ?
Close your eyes .
Now , you &apos;ve been watching me for about 30 seconds .
With your eyes closed , what am I wearing ?
Make your best guess .
What color is my shirt ? What color is my tie ?
Now open your eyes .
By a show of hands , were you right ?
For me , I like to call him Frank .
So Frank is sitting at a desk .
What just happened ? Do you have a wallet ?
Do you have an American Express in your wallet ?
And when I do that , your Frank turns around .
He accesses the file . He has to rewind the tape .
Just hold still where you are .
You did a wonderful job onstage .
Do you have your ring as well ?
Good . Just taking inventory . You &apos;re like a buffet .
Hi , how are you ? Good to see you .
Oh , you &apos;re married . You follow directions well .
That &apos;s nice to meet you , sir .
Hi , sir , how are you ?
Apollo Robbins : Well , we &apos;ll find one for you .
Come on up this way , Joe .
Give Joe a round of applause .
Come on up Joe . Let &apos;s play a game .
Pardon me .
Thank you very much . I appreciate that .
AR : Money . All right , let &apos;s try that .
Can you stand right over this way for me ?
Now this is a task for you to focus on .
I &apos;m not ready for that kind of commitment .
It was a big miscommunication .
So let &apos;s do this simply . Squeeze your hand .
Joe : Very . AR : Good .
Open your hand . Thank you very much .
I &apos;ll cheat if you give me a chance .
Make it harder for me . Just use your hand .
Grab my wrist , but squeeze , squeeze firm .
Did you see it go ?
Go ahead and take it off .
Now , let &apos;s try that again .
Squeeze firm . You &apos;re human , you &apos;re not slow .
It &apos;s back on your shoulder .
Yet you had something inside your front pocket .
Do you remember what it was ?
Joe : Money .
I &apos;m going to try to push it inside your hand .
Put your other hand on top for me , would you ?
It &apos;s amazingly obvious now , isn &apos;t it ?
Hold your hands together . Put your other hand on top .
It &apos;s not back on your shoulder .
Did you see it go ?
That &apos;s great . I need help with this one .
Step over this way for me .
Can I feel the outside of your pocket for a moment ?
Joe : Yeah . I &apos;m saving it for later .
Hopefully it matches his taste .
Joe , thank you very much .
What am I wearing ?
Attention is a powerful thing .
Like I said , it shapes your reality .
Thank you .
Daniel Goldstein : The battle between your present and future self
All right , so tie me to the mast . &quot;
I want to hear that song . Untie me . &quot;
And the first mate wisely resists and doesn &apos;t untie Odysseus .
And the first mate hesitates .
So he unties Odysseus , and Odysseus flips out .
He &apos;s like , &quot; You idiot . You moron .
Now just don &apos;t untie me no matter what . &quot;
He throws the first mate to the ground .
Hilarity ensues .
There is first , the present self .
This is like Odysseus when he &apos;s hearing the song .
He just wants to get to the front row .
But then there &apos;s this other self , the future self .
So why do we need commitment devices ?
It &apos;s physically possible to lose weight .
It &apos;s physically possible to exercise more .
But resisting temptation is hard .
It &apos;s in control . It &apos;s in power right now .
And the future self is not even around .
It &apos;s off in the future . It &apos;s weak .
It doesn &apos;t even have a lawyer present .
There &apos;s nobody to stick up for the future self .
And so the present self can trounce all over its dreams .
Now I &apos;m a big fan of commitment devices actually .
Such it is with commitment devices .
I think self-discipline is something , it &apos;s like a muscle .
The more you exercise it , the stronger it gets .
And this is a timely issue .
I &apos;m talking about the topic of saving .
Now saving is a classic two selves problem .
The present self does not want to save at all .
It wants to consume .
Whereas the future self wants the present self to save .
So this is a timely problem .
So what can we do about this ?
On the one hand , it sounds ridiculous .
And I &apos;ll show you some of these tools right here .
The first is called the distribution builder .
Now you can try to move your outcomes around .
It means that you have to save more today .
And what it is is an exploration into virtual reality .
So this is one of our experiments .
Other conditions show people the future self .
So for instance , here is somebody using the tool .
And just watch the facial expressions as they move the slider .
The younger face gets happier and happier , saving nothing .
The older face is miserable .
And then it &apos;s a high savings rate .
The younger face is getting unhappy .
The older face is quite pleased with the decision .
Your decisions today are going to determine its well-being .
And that &apos;s something that &apos;s easy to forget .
This is actually a picture of Hal , my coauthor .
You might recognize him from the previous demos .
And I &apos;ll close it there .
Thank you .
Hanna Rosin : New data on the rise of women
Not a lot of women did .
The &apos; 20s and the &apos; 60s also come to mind .
And I realized that two things were different this time around .
And now look at this second set of slides .
Women , a majority of the workplace .
And labor statistics : women take up most managerial jobs .
That particular headline comes to me from a market research firm .
But in fact , they found something very surprising .
Now what does that mean ?
This has been going on for 40 years now .
There we go .
So what &apos;s that about ?
But of course , it &apos;s not about that .
But that really isn &apos;t true anymore .
You would be issuing orders from above .
You would be very hierarchical .
You would tell everyone below you what to do .
But that &apos;s not what an ideal leader is like now .
And those are all things that women do very well .
So that &apos;s childcare , elder care and food preparation .
And here the story is fairly simple .
Women are getting college degrees at a faster rate than men .
Why ? This is a real mystery .
Noa : The girls are obviously smarter .
I mean they have much larger vocabulary .
They learn much faster .
They are more controlled .
On the board today for losing recess tomorrow , only boys .
Hanna Rosin : And why is that ?
HR : So there you go .
And this was kind of a shocker to me .
So who were they ?
And this was very disheartening for them .
&quot; That &apos;s your salary .
So who &apos;s the man now ? &quot; he asked them .
&quot; Who &apos;s the damn man ?
She &apos;s the man now . &quot;
And that really sent a shudder through the room .
It &apos;s happening all over the world .
And now look at the chart .
That &apos;s from 1985 to 2003 .
How much do you prefer a first-born son ?
And they come up in lots of different forms .
So we have the perpetual adolescent .
We have the charmless misanthrope .
You &apos;ve got Lady Gaga .
And it &apos;s not just for the young , right ?
Even Helen Mirren can hold a gun these days .
Now I &apos;ve never really liked this term .
And we &apos;re always below the glass ceiling , the women .
What crazy person would pop their head through a glass ceiling ?
You can bring your husband along .
Thanks very much .
George Monbiot : For more wonder , rewild the world
This is why wars get fought .
I was , I believe , ecologically bored .
Now , I don &apos;t romanticize evolutionary time .
Nor was it authenticity that I was looking for .
I don &apos;t find that a useful or even intelligible concept .
But there are two in particular that fascinate me .
The first one is the mass restoration of ecosystems .
It sounds strange , but just follow me for a while .
And beavers , like wolves , are ecosystem engineers .
They create niches for other species .
But here &apos;s where it gets really interesting .
The wolves changed the behavior of the rivers .
They began to meander less .
There was less erosion . The channels narrowed .
Whales in the southern oceans have similarly wide-ranging effects .
But the opposite happened .
Why would that possibly have happened ?
Here are the whales changing the composition of the atmosphere .
The other one is the rewilding of human life .
And I don &apos;t see this as an alternative to civilization .
What megafauna , you say ?
Well , every continent had one , apart from Antarctica .
They are elephant-adapted .
It was a lot bigger than the Asian elephant .
Perhaps because they evolved to resist browsing by rhinoceros .
Thank you .
Robert Thurman : We can be Buddhas
Thank you .
All the young people , actually , from the city .
They wouldn &apos;t go listen to him .
But the young people all came .
It just becomes intolerable .
We do enjoy our misery in a certain way .
Who &apos;s going to get enough out of the world ?
It would be terrible .
But apparently , this is a strange paradox of life .
You know , we really learned everything in the &apos; 60s .
And we feel ourselves differently . It &apos;s totally strange .
It &apos;s totally strange .
And then it &apos;s never good enough .
They didn &apos;t help at all .
And so then he looks at me .
He feels the way they are harvesting yaks nowadays .
And yet he &apos;s very jolly . He &apos;s extremely jolly .
It &apos;s really lovely .
The human being is almost out of time .
The human being is compassion because what is our brain for ?
Now , Jim &apos;s brain is memorizing the almanac .
And he would have tremendous fun doing that .
It is Nirvana .
Thank you .
Claron McFadden : Singing the primal mystery
Folks , you &apos;ve just met Claron McFadden .
Her celebrated operatic roles are numerous and varied .
Please welcome Claron McFadden .
I can &apos;t make noise .
She said , &quot; Please , sing for me . &quot;
The emotions can flow from me to you and back .
Extremely profound experience .
It &apos;s called &quot; Aria . &quot;
It was written for an amazing singer called Cathy Berberian .
No notes , no flats , no sharps .
And there &apos;s different text .
There &apos;s Armenian , Russian , French , English , Italian .
So within this structure one is free .
So I would like to share this piece with you .
It &apos;s &quot; Aria &quot; of John Cage .
Andrea Ghez : The hunt for a supermassive black hole
How do you observe something you can &apos;t see ?
So , what is a black hole ?
And I &apos;m going to only talk about the mass .
So , this is a little tricky .
So why is it so important ?
At that point , what &apos;s going to happen ?
At that point gravity wins .
Gravity wins over all other known forces .
And then it &apos;s a black hole .
It depends only on the mass of the object .
Bigger objects have bigger Schwarzschild radii .
Smaller objects have smaller Schwarzschild radii .
So , now we know what a Schwarzschild radius is .
I only need two things .
And your job today is to be skeptical .
On an astronomical scale that &apos;s a very small black hole .
There are big ones . There are little ones .
Almost every object in that picture there is a galaxy .
So , we see the galaxy because of the star light .
Now , there are a few relatively exotic galaxies .
And we call them active galactic nuclei .
It &apos;s way more energetic .
There are also jets emanating out from the center .
But it &apos;s a kind of indirect argument .
And what we see is a line of stars .
Which is the job that I have to show you today .
It &apos;s the gravitational pull that makes these things orbit .
And that is because of the atmosphere .
And that buys us about a factor of 20 .
So , without this technology you can &apos;t see the stars .
With this technology all of a sudden you can see it .
So , I want to see how these things have moved .
Absolutely my favorite star in the world .
And that &apos;s because it goes around in only 15 years .
That &apos;s kind of profound , in a way .
You can see a lot of stars .
Now , truth in advertising . Right ?
And the truth is , I &apos;m not quite there .
And that &apos;s the fun .
So , let me give you the two examples .
And it &apos;s a very fragile entity .
And what does the big black hole do ?
It strips that gas cloud apart .
So , you shouldn &apos;t see young stars .
So , what do we see ?
The old ones are red .
So , you can already see the surprise .
There is a dearth of old stars .
So , this is the fun part .
So , we want to build a 30 meter telescope .
Thanks very much .
Ryan Lobo : Photographing the hidden story
I found this photography of mine almost compulsive .
In 2007 , I traveled to three war zones .
I traveled to Iraq , Afghanistan and Liberia .
I would feel very isolated during these discussions .
Photography transcended culture , including my own .
He got his name from fighting stark naked .
This woman witnessed the General murdering her brother .
Today the General is a baptized Christian evangelist .
And he &apos;s on a mission .
He forgives the General in this image .
In this photograph a hostile crowd in a slum surrounds him .
And Joshua remains silent as they vented their rage against him .
I was intensely moved during all this .
But the question is , does forgiveness and redemption replace justice ?
They use negotiation and tolerance more often than an armed response .
And that they were definitely capable of diffusing it non-aggressively .
And yes , all of those people killed were male .
They answer more than 5,000 calls in just two months .
Something amazing happened during this shoot .
These men were terrified , as the mob attacked our vehicle .
Now , hundreds of homes were destroyed .
Where does such rage come from ?
And how are we responsible for this ?
They lack even the most basic amenities .
In India we often love to complain about our government bodies .
And that &apos;s the power of storytelling .
Lucianne Walkowicz : Finding planets around other stars
Can you see it ?
There we go .
And I &apos;ll tell you why .
This is our star . This is our Sun .
It &apos;s shown here in visible light .
They also cause the light from the star to vary .
However , these are just the tip of the iceberg .
Thank you .
Diébédo Francis Kéré : How to build with clay ... and community
I am a native of Burkina Faso .
I am an example of that .
I was born in a little village called Gando .
Today , not so much has changed .
There is still no electricity in my village .
But I was lucky .
I had a scholarship .
I could go to Germany to study .
But what to do with this privilege ?
I just wanted to use my skills and build a school .
Fundraising was not an easy task .
So I had to convince everybody .
I was allowed to use even traditional techniques .
And then the polishers come .
They start polishing it with a stone for hours .
It &apos;s not photoshopped .
This is the school , built with the community .
And the kids , they love it .
It has opened up opportunities to do more projects in Gando .
The first one is the school extension , of course .
I started to build a prototype like that .
The innovation was to build a clay vault .
The community is looking . It still works .
So we can build .
And we kept building , and that is the result .
The kids are happy , and they love it .
The community is very proud . We made it .
And even animals , like these donkeys , love our buildings .
The next project is the library in Gando .
Something we have in Gando are clay pots .
We wanted to use them to create openings .
The openings are letting the hot air out and light in .
Very simple .
My most recent project in Gando is a high school project .
I would like to share with you this .
How do you cast mud ?
And sometimes I can leave .
They will do it themselves .
I came to speak to you like that .
Another factor in Gando is rain .
Don &apos;t confound with Christo and Jeanne-Claude .
It is simply how we protect our walls .
But for us , the rain is good .
We just wait for the rain to go .
That is it .
But you will be surprised . I &apos;m still alive .
There &apos;s a new quality in this work .
Yes , you know it .
I have won a lot of awards through this work .
For sure , it has opened opportunities .
I have become myself known .
In my culture , this is a symbol of deep affection .
As a seven-year-old guy , I was impressed .
Merci beaucoup .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
Joachim de Posada : Don &apos;t eat the marshmallow !
And it was found close to here , Stanford .
Exact equivalent .
So what happened when the professor left the room ?
As soon as the door closed ...
two out of three ate the marshmallow .
Some lasted 14-and-a-half minutes .
Couldn &apos;t do it . Could not wait .
Would look at it .
Put it back .
Self-discipline : the most important factor for success .
What did they find ?
They had good grades . They were doing wonderful .
They were happy . They had their plans .
They had good relationships with the teachers , students .
They were doing fine .
They did not make it to university .
They had bad grades . Some of them dropped out .
A few were still there with bad grades .
A few had good grades .
So I went to Colombia . And I reproduced the experiment .
And let me show you what happened .
So what happened in Colombia ?
But she ate it .
But she will be successful .
And this applies for everything . Even in sales .
That person ate the marshmallow .
If the sales person says , &quot; Wait a second .
Then you sell a lot more .
So this has applications in all walks of life .
I end with -- the Koreans did this .
They are teaching these kids exactly this principle .
We are eating more marshmallows than we are producing .
Thank you so much .
Gregory Stock : To upgrade is human
It felt wrong to do that in some way .
I &apos;m focusing on biology , the biological sciences .
the areas that are the most significant to us .
It &apos;s because we &apos;re flesh and blood .
We &apos;re biological creatures .
I think that Shakespeare really put it very nicely .
And then from hour to hour we rot and rot .
And thereby hangs a tale . &quot;
Life is short , you know .
And we need to think about planning a little bit .
This is where it &apos;s really central to our lives .
You just have to look at the Human Genome Project .
We &apos;re deciphering the code of codes .
We &apos;re reading the book of life .
You know it &apos;s 2003 , and there is no HAL .
And we &apos;re still picking up pieces of the Challenger .
And this is very critical stuff .
This is not the stomping ground of our Pleistocene ancestors .
It &apos;s going to happen a lot sooner than people imagine .
It &apos;s going to change the way we have children .
It &apos;s going to probably change the human lifespan .
is the revolution in biology .
But who is going to pay for all this ?
And how are we going to understand all this complex information ?
That &apos;s going to have amazing impacts .
The approval process is going to fall apart , actually .
It &apos;s too slow .
It &apos;s too risk-averse .
It would change absolutely everything .
The second is modifying our emotions .
You know , this is just clumsy little baby steps .
Probably not .
Why do you do what you do ?
We &apos;re sort of circumventing evolutionary programs that guide our behavior .
It &apos;s going to be very challenging to deal with .
The third area is reproduction .
The first is cloning .
It didn &apos;t happen .
It &apos;s a total media circus .
It will happen in five to 10 years .
It &apos;s already done to avoid rare diseases today .
Of course there is going to be genetic engineering .
They &apos;ll want the new release .
They are really going to come to operate in this realm .
Now not everything that can be done should be done .
And it won &apos;t be done .
Humanity is going to go down this path .
And it &apos;s going to do so for two reasons .
It is being funded very very -- in a big way .
The second is , we &apos;re human .
That &apos;s what we do .
That &apos;s really the central one , I believe .
People can try and ban these things .
They undoubtedly will . They have .
It &apos;s going to drive these things from view .
So , sure , we need to debate these things .
And I think it &apos;s wonderful that we do .
That is simply not going to happen .
They touch us too deeply .
Other people are going to say , &quot; This is great .
This is the flowering of human endeavor . &quot;
It &apos;s not going to happen .
And that &apos;s where about half of our drugs come .
In fact this isn &apos;t just abstract .
So here we are .
And they are actually going to romanticize this moment in time .
You know it &apos;s a little bit like a birth .
Where there is this bloody , awful mess happens .
And then what comes out of it ? New life .
We &apos;re going to make lots of errors .
That &apos;s the way these things work .
It will always be remembered .
I think that we should be proud of it .
We are , definitely .
It &apos;s how we hold it in our hearts .
It &apos;s how we look at it .
Thank you .
Philip Zimbardo : The demise of guys ?
Other than that , there &apos;s not much of a problem .
So what &apos;s the data ?
So the data on dropping out is amazing .
In Canada , five boys drop out for every three girls .
Two-thirds of all students in special ed. remedial programs are guys .
What &apos;s the evidence of wiping out ?
First , it &apos;s a new fear of intimacy .
And we &apos;re seeing a steady increase among males .
And this is two kinds .
It &apos;s a social awkwardness .
The old shyness was a fear of rejection .
The problem is these are arousal addictions .
Drug addiction , you simply want more .
Arousal addiction , you want different .
Drugs , you want more of the same -- different .
And the problem is the industry is supplying it .
The average boy now watches 50 porn video clips a week .
And there &apos;s some guy watching a hundred , obviously .
So what &apos;s the solution ? It &apos;s not my job .
No offense to banana slug owners . Thank you .
Ivan Krastev : Can democracy exist without trust ?
Basically you believe in complexity , but not in ambiguity .
As you have been told , I &apos;m Bulgarian .
But then the rain stopped , people went to vote .
The government and the opposition , they have been simply paralyzed .
Because you know what to do about the protests .
You know who to arrest , who to negotiate with .
So the government decided to have the elections once again .
Democracy is the only game in town .
I mean the unemployed , the under-privileged .
And this is a major issue .
And I &apos;ll start with what went right .
It was the human rights moment .
But after that you have the market revolution of the 1980s .
And you have more choice-driven societies .
And it was the birth of the global world .
And you have the Internet .
The very idea of political community totally has changed .
So this is what went right .
All this was very much under attack .
Now we have the reverse tendency .
Now the elites basically have been liberated .
They &apos;re very mobile . You cannot tax them .
And basically they don &apos;t fear the people .
This is also partly a result of the Internet revolution .
This is the other side of the things that we like .
Before , revolutions used to have ideological names .
You have Facebook revolutions , Twitter revolutions .
This is probably true .
Transparency is not about restoring trust in institutions .
Transparency is politics &apos; management of mistrust .
This is why you have checks and balances .
But is this the idea of a free society ?
So for me this is extremely important .
But also don &apos;t forget , any unveiling is also veiling .
And the public was extremely all for it .
Thank you very much .
Alanna Shaikh : How I &apos;m preparing to get Alzheimer &apos;s
I &apos;d like to talk about my dad .
My dad has Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
That &apos;s a lot of people .
That &apos;s what happened with my dad .
He got dementia anyway .
So I &apos;m preparing to get Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
It &apos;s confusing to watch television , and often very frightening .
And reading is just about impossible .
Would they give me charts and graphs that I could color ?
That all seems like win to me .
even when it &apos;s so hard .
I don &apos;t want to get Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
Thank you .
Dan Pink : The puzzle of motivation
I need to make a confession at the outset here .
To put it mildly , I didn &apos;t do very well .
Thank you .
I don &apos;t want to tell you a story .
I want to make a case .
This is called the candle problem .
Some of you might have seen this before .
It &apos;s created in 1945 by a psychologist named Karl Duncker .
Doesn &apos;t work .
It &apos;s an awesome idea . Doesn &apos;t work .
The key is to overcome what &apos;s called functional fixedness .
This shows the power of incentives .
Here &apos;s what he did . He gathered his participants .
To the second group he offered rewards .
It &apos;s a nice motivator .
Question : How much faster did this group solve the problem ?
That &apos;s not how it &apos;s supposed to work . Right ?
Bonuses , commissions , their own reality show .
Incentivize them . That &apos;s how business works .
But that &apos;s not happening here .
It dulls thinking and blocks creativity .
And I &apos;m telling you , it &apos;s not even close .
That &apos;s actually fine for many kinds of 20th century tasks .
Let me show you what I mean .
Same deal . You : we &apos;re timing for norms .
You : we &apos;re incentivizing .
What happened this time ?
You want to be looking around .
That reward actually narrows our focus and restricts our possibility .
Let me tell you why this is so important .
Software can do it faster .
Low-cost providers around the world can do it cheaper .
Think about your own work .
Think about your own work .
The rules are mystifying .
Now , I mean it makes me crazy .
And this is not -- here &apos;s the thing .
This is not a feeling .
This is not a philosophy .
I &apos;m an American ; I don &apos;t believe in philosophy .
Let me give you an example of what I mean .
Lets go to Madurai , India and test this . &quot;
Standard of living is lower .
What happens ?
Is this some kind of touchy-feely socialist conspiracy going on here ?
And do you know who sponsored this research ?
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States .
That &apos;s the American experience .
We need a whole new approach .
It &apos;s an approach built much more around intrinsic motivation .
Autonomy : the urge to direct our own lives .
I want to talk today only about autonomy .
Management did not emanate from nature .
Okay ? Somebody invented it .
And it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s going to work forever .
Management is great .
Traditional notions of management are great if you want compliance .
But if you want engagement , self-direction works better .
Let me give you some examples .
How many of you have heard of the company Atlassian ?
It looks like less than half .
Atlassian is an Australian software company .
And they do something incredibly cool .
Work on anything you want . &quot;
And then , being Australians , everybody has a beer .
They call them FedEx Days .
Why ? Because you have to deliver something overnight .
Okay ? Radical amounts of autonomy .
In a ROWE people don &apos;t have schedules .
They show up when they want .
They just have to get their work done .
Meetings in these kinds of environments are optional .
What happens ?
And I say , &quot; Nope . I have proof . &quot;
The mid-1990s , Microsoft started an encyclopedia called Encarta .
A few years later another encyclopedia got started .
Different model , right ?
Do it because you like to do it .
If they went head to head , who would win ? &quot;
This is the titanic battle between these two approaches .
This is the Ali-Frazier of motivation . Right ?
This is the Thrilla &apos; in Manila .
Alright ? Intrinsic motivators versus extrinsic motivators .
And here is what science knows .
Two : Those if-then rewards often destroy creativity .
The drive to do things cause they matter .
I rest my case .
Gayle Tzemach Lemmon : Women entrepreneurs , example not exception
We do not invest in victims , we invest in survivors .
You can &apos;t count what you don &apos;t see .
And we don &apos;t invest in what &apos;s invisible to us .
But this is the face of resilience .
And that turned out to be women .
So I was amazed .
Why are you so passionate ? &quot;
And that &apos;s really how I became an entrepreneur . &quot;
So maybe you could interview her . &quot;
And she was just the start .
So these stories together became the Herald Tribune business cover .
But think about this .
Most people say women .
Why is that ?
They want to move from micro to medium and beyond .
And in many places , they &apos;re there .
China , women run 20 percent of all small businesses .
They are often ignored because they &apos;re harder to help .
She sells chocolates .
The great news is we already know what works .
Theory and empirical evidence Have already taught us .
And that &apos;s just to start .
I think that is terrific .
You know why ?
So the great news is this is an incredible opportunity .
We have so much room to grow .
Now that makes me pause for just a couple reasons .
&quot; You will find a job . Take the leap . &quot;
The women in my family are not exceptions .
The women in this room and watching in L.A.
and all around the world are not exceptions .
We are not a special interest group .
We are the majority .
And it is time for all of us to think bigger .
Thank you very much .
Mitchell Joachim : Don &apos;t build your home , grow it !
Why grow homes ? Because we can .
Right now , America is in an unremitting state of trauma .
And there &apos;s a cause for that , all right .
We &apos;ve got McPeople , McCars , McHouses .
As an architect , I have to confront something like this .
Well , it &apos;s been around for 2,500 years .
It fits into the environment . It is the environment .
It is the landscape , right ?
They &apos;re perfect .
And what we do is we grow extracellular matrix from pigs .
We use a modified inkjet printer , and we print geometry .
It &apos;s victimless . It &apos;s meat from a test tube .
And we know it &apos;s incredibly ugly .
That &apos;s why we grow homes . Thanks very much .
Little did I know that it was mine as well .
&quot; Huhuhuhuhuhuhuhahahahaha . &quot;
But somehow , it didn &apos;t matter about the publicity .
There was no money involved .
The village square was filled with hundreds of people .
And they put on an opera all night long .
Human beings needed the light .
They needed the light to see .
I start with the notion of the ideograph .
Three strokes , you get the whole bamboo forest .
What is the abstraction ?
The circle . The circle . It &apos;s so obvious .
The circle of life . The circle of Mufasa &apos;s mask .
And you see the mechanics .
You don &apos;t question that .
I love the apparent truth of theater .
I love that people are willing to fill in the blanks .
You took pieces of sticks .
You added silk to the bottom .
And in a way , that is what makes it spiritual .
That &apos;s what moves you .
It &apos;s not the actual literal sunrise that &apos;s coming .
It &apos;s the art of it .
And I &apos;m one who loves high tech and low tech .
I did it always with a male Prospero .
Prospera : At first sight , they have changed eyes .
Miranda : Do you love me ?
Ferdinand : Beyond all limit .
HM : They are both in either &apos;s powers .
Trinculo : Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows .
Looking for business , governor ?
Caliban : Hast thou not dropped from heaven ?
Stephano : Out of the moon , I do assure thee .
Prospera : Caliban !
Caliban : This island is mine .
Sebastian : Draw thy sword .
And I , the king , shall love thee .
Prospera : I will plague them all , even to roaring .
Ariel : I have made you mad .
Prospera : We are such stuff as dreams are made on .
and our little life is rounded with a sleep .
JT : Okay .
And all of a sudden , the audience &apos;s perspective changes .
It becomes something magically large .
It becomes the rainstorm .
Now I &apos;m going to take you to &quot; Spider-Man . &quot;
Spider Man is not bound by gravity .
Manhattan in the show is not bound by gravity either .
It &apos;s real , what &apos;s happening .
Bono : They &apos;re mythologies .
They &apos;re modern myths , these comic book heroes .
Circus , rock &apos; n &apos; roll , drama .
What the hell are we doing up there on that stage ?
Well , one last story , very quickly .
Did you hear the lyrics ?
To my right is sheer shale . It &apos;s coming off .
And no hiking boots .
I know you &apos;ve all been there .
I &apos;m in the crucible right now .
It &apos;s my trial by fire .
It &apos;s my company &apos;s trials by fire .
We survive because our theme song is &quot; Rise Above . &quot;
Boy falls from the sky , rise above .
I know you understand that .
Thank you .
Pearl Arredondo : My story , from gangland daughter to star teacher
My dad was a high-ranking gang member who ran the streets .
Man , her office was packed .
But that doesn &apos;t mean that we can &apos;t .
It just takes a little bit more .
Not so much .
It was gang-infested , huge teacher turnover rate .
I took a school bus to the fancy side of town .
You had to survive .
You just had to do things sometimes .
She has an issue with authority .
She &apos;s not going to go anywhere . &quot;
Some teachers completely wrote me off as a lost cause .
And boy , they were like , &quot; What ? Why ?
Why would you want to do that ? &quot;
And I am going to be their help along the way .
So as a rookie teacher , I created opportunity .
How do you get to build those relationships ?
So we created a new school .
And we created the San Fernando Institute for Applied Media .
We wanted those freedoms .
But we had to do it .
Our community deserved a new way of doing things .
Yeah , what if we get it wrong ?
But what if we get it right ?
And we did .
So in our third year , how did we do it ?
Well , we &apos;re making school worth coming to every day .
We make our kids feel like they matter to us .
Animation , software , moviemaking software , they have it all .
These were played in the local trolley system .
Thank you .
Mustafa Akyol : Faith versus tradition in Islam
There was no separation of sexes .
In other words , men and women were worshiping all together .
They were together while praying .
And I noticed this in a very funny way .
I left the Kaaba to eat something in downtown Mecca .
I headed to the nearest Burger King restaurant .
Quite ironic .
But apparently that was not an issue at the time .
So the rituals came that way .
And these were traditions of the Middle East -- medieval traditions .
There is a practice called female circumcision .
It &apos;s something terrible , horrible .
It is basically an operation to deprive women of sexual pleasure .
It was there for thousands of years .
And quite tellingly , some Muslims do practice that .
The Muslims in North Africa , not in other places .
And we see truly in some Muslim communities that tradition .
It should be the citizen &apos;s decision .
But the secular-minded people can be influenced by that .
And there are strengths in Islamic tradition .
You can derive many ideas from that .
But besides that , I also saw problems within Islamic tradition .
The Koran , for example , doesn &apos;t condone stoning .
There is no punishment on apostasy .
There is no punishment on personal things like drinking .
That interpretation is quite possible and feasible .
But that &apos;s not the case at all .
The context has changed .
And when you have colonization what do you have ?
You have anti-colonization .
That &apos;s one thing to remember .
And Arab masses just revolted against their dictators .
They were asking for democracy ; they were asking for freedom .
They said that &quot; we want freedom ; we want democracy .
Of course , this is a long road .
Democracy is not an overnight achievement ; it &apos;s a process .
But this is a promising era in the Muslim world .
Thanks so much .
Keller Rinaudo : A mini robot -- powered by your phone
Not very many of you .
So a couple .
That &apos;s okay .
This robot can &apos;t be creepy or uncanny .
He should be friendly and cute .
So meet Romo .
When Romo wakes up , he &apos;s in creature mode .
If I duck down , he &apos;ll follow me .
If I come over here -- He &apos;s smart .
Thanks , little guy .
Bless you .
So here &apos;s the iPad .
And Romo will actually stream video to this device .
If I get in front of Romo here .
I &apos;ve always wanted a picture of a 1,500-person TED audience .
So I &apos;ll snap a picture .
So there are all of you through Romo &apos;s eyes .
You do not have to teach someone how to drive Romo .
In fact , who would like to drive a robot ?
Okay . Awesome .
Here you go .
Thank you , Scott .
Thanks , Scott .
They change from person to person .
To be honest , I have no idea .
Thank you .
Greg Asner : Ecology from the air
Technology can change our understanding of nature .
Take for example the case of lions .
You &apos;ve heard this too , I can tell .
They just use a different strategy .
So how can we save what we don &apos;t understand ?
The hottest pinks are the fastest-growing plants .
I want to share three of those questions with you today .
That &apos;s all ships , airplanes , trains and automobiles combined .
Basically , we need a high-tech accounting system .
The colors are going to be going from red to blue .
You &apos;re seeing the buffer zone around the Panama Canal .
That &apos;s in the reds and yellows .
The forest is on the left .
Here you see actual data showing different species in different colors .
This puts incredible pressure and responsibility on park management .
Some of their decisions have really big impacts .
Going forward , I plan to greatly expand the airborne observatory .
Thank you .
Shukla Bose : Teaching one child at a time
And I &apos;m not a trained academic .
Neither am I a veteran social worker .
The first thing that we did was walk through the slums .
How many children will you get ?
How are you going to scale ?
How are you going to replicate ? &quot;
So , we started Parikrma .
That was our first school . One hundred sixty-five children .
Indian academic year begins in June .
My God ! What a bonding exercise that was .
Now , when you talk global you have to talk English .
And so all our schools are English medium schools .
No one in their family has spoken English .
No one in their generation has spoken English .
But how wrong it is .
The vocabulary used in those books and the style of writing .
They &apos;ll never be able to cope . &quot;
That &apos;s absolute hogwash .
Fathers have started to attend .
Now they have started writing their signature .
The children have taught them .
It &apos;s amazing how much children can teach .
We had 25 mothers who came regularly after school to study .
Ninety-eight percent of our fathers are alcoholics .
We have about three fathers who have been trained to cook .
We have taught them nutrition , hygiene .
I mingled with almost everyone .
They were very friendly .
Even now we are in touch through Facebook .
Before that I feel like I wasn &apos;t like this .
My accent with English improved a lot .
And today she wants to be a neurologist .
Our children are doing brilliantly in sports .
They are really excelling .
We &apos;ve got the best school award for three years successively .
We also have our very own dream team .
Why is this happening ? Why this confidence ?
Art , music are considered therapy and mediums of expression .
We didn &apos;t hire McKinsey to do a business plan .
This is five-year-old Parusharam .
He &apos;s in kindergarten .
He has learned how to speak English .
I like eating . I like playing . &quot;
Now , &quot; horsing &quot; is going for a horse ride .
So , Parusharam comes to my office every day .
But today I have been transformed .
I have been changed with my children .
Thank you .
Richard St. John : 8 secrets of success
She said , &quot; What leads to success ? &quot;
And the first thing is passion .
Did he say fun ? Rupert ? Yes !
TEDsters do have fun working . And they work hard .
I figured , they &apos;re not workaholics . They &apos;re workafrolics .
And push ! David Gallo says , &quot; Push yourself .
You gotta push through shyness and self-doubt .
Goldie Hawn says , &quot; I always had self-doubts .
I wasn &apos;t good enough ; I wasn &apos;t smart enough .
I didn &apos;t think I &apos;d make it . &quot;
Because that &apos;s the way people really get rich . &quot;
I &apos;d say it was a pretty good idea .
And I give lots of evidence .
You gotta persist through failure . You gotta persist through crap !
Thank you TEDsters for all your interviews !
Annie Lennox : Why I am an HIV / AIDS activist
And this is the name of my campaign : SING Campaign .
You can see the bars of the window there .
It was quite a momentous occasion for all of us .
I have to serve . &quot;
I met him at a 46664 event .
He was wearing a t-shirt like the one I wear now .
It doesn &apos;t have to be in the closet . &quot;
They work in the field .
They have education programs .
They bring out the issues of stigma .
It &apos;s quite extraordinary what they do .
So this is my SING Campaign .
This is in the Scottish Parliament .
I &apos;ve subsequently become an envoy for Scotland and HIV .
This can happen .
Now that is prevention at the very beginning of life .
This is Avelile -- she goes with me wherever I go .
Avelile had the virus , she was born with the virus .
The doctors and nurses were phenomenal .
This is the transformation that took place .
Isn &apos;t it extraordinary ?
And I take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation .
Thank you very much .
Annie Murphy Paul : What we learn before we &apos;re born
My subject today is learning .
Ready ?
When does learning begin ?
Now I &apos;m a science reporter .
I write books and magazine articles .
And I &apos;m also a mother .
How can we know this ?
Babies quickly show their preference by choosing the first one .
Now why would this kind of fetal learning be useful ?
It may have evolved to aid the baby &apos;s survival .
It &apos;s also tastes and smells .
Now it turns out that fetuses are learning even bigger lessons .
And often it does something more .
Will it be born into a world of abundance or scarcity ?
The specter of mass starvation loomed .
But others wouldn &apos;t be discovered for many years .
Why would undernutrition in the womb result in disease later ?
But that may not be all that &apos;s going on .
Here &apos;s another story .
1,700 of these people were pregnant women .
But there &apos;s another way of thinking about PTSD .
Let me be clear .
Thank you .
Steven Pinker : Human nature and the blank slate
&quot; Do you have tenure ? &quot;
They are : the arts and parenting .
Let me start with the arts .
Well , in fact , the arts are not in decline .
Well , here &apos;s a diagnosis .
And here &apos;s just one example .
Well , you get the idea .
People are staying away from elite art and criticism .
What a puzzle -- I wonder why .
But it certainly inspired an energetic reaction from many university professors .
Well , the other hot button is parenting .
Well , here &apos;s some sobering facts about parenting .
The genetically controlled studies have some sobering results .
That would make them super-similar , right ?
OK -- two different bodies of research with a similar finding .
And that presents us with a choice .
Thank you very much .
Lewis Pugh : How I swam the North Pole
He was a great storyteller .
He had been there and watched it go off .
He also told me about the great explorers .
I really , really wanted to go to the Arctic .
There was something about that place which drew me to it .
I love the place .
And we need to do something about it right now .
Fresh water freezes at zero .
And the water at the North Pole is minus 1.7 .
It &apos;s fucking freezing .
I assembled this team of 29 people from 10 nations .
It couldn &apos;t be further from the truth for me .
And I had to visualize the swim .
I had to taste the salt water in my mouth .
I felt confident that I could actually do this swim .
So we stopped the ship , as you do .
I have never in my life felt anything like that moment .
I could barely breathe . I was gasping for air .
I swam as hard as I could for five minutes .
I remember just trying to get out of the water .
I climbed out of the ice .
There is no possibility that this was going to happen .
He accidentally fell through the ice into the sea .
We are going to actually have to take them off . &quot;
This is such an important swim .
There were open patches of sea everywhere .
And then we walked out onto the ice .
I had never seen black water before .
And it is 4,200 meters deep .
Just scuttle forward and go for it . &quot;
We &apos;ve just seen our first polar bears .
It was absolutely magical .
A mother and a cub , such a beautiful sight .
It &apos;s a very frightening , very , very frightening thought .
It &apos;s all a little bit frightening , and emotional .
Amundson , you ready ? Amudson : Ready .
Take the goggles off . Take the goggles off !
Take the shoes . Take the shoes .
You did it ! You did it man !
LP : How on earth did we do that ?
Against the current ! You did it against the current !
LP : Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
Thank you so much .
Audience : Encore !
But was it worth it ? Yes , absolutely it was .
You saw during that video all those flags .
Those flags represented the countries from which my team came from .
Britain , America , Japan , South Africa , the Congo .
We need to believe in ourselves .
Now is the time to believe .
We &apos;ve come a long way . We &apos;re doing good .
Ladies and gentlemen , thank you very , very much .
Dan Ariely : Beware conflicts of interest
So , I was in the hospital for a long time .
And what &apos;s the brilliant idea he had ?
It sounded interesting . He asked me to go and shave .
What would happen then ? &quot;
&quot; We have lasers ; we can whiten it out . &quot;
Do you enjoy looking non-symmetric ?
Do you have some kind of perverted pleasure from this ?
None of those happened .
But I decided not to have this treatment .
Where was this guilt trip coming from ? &quot;
Now you probably think that this guy &apos;s a schmuck .
Right , that &apos;s what he seems like .
So I looked carefully at this guy .
He was 20-some years older than anybody else in the sample .
Who would ever include a drunken guy in a sample ? &quot;
What would have happened if he was in the other group ?
Would we have thrown him out then ? &quot;
I wasn &apos;t doing something bad .
But this was not the case .
I do want to leave you with one positive thought .
Sebastian Thrun : Google &apos;s driverless car
As a boy , I loved cars .
Like this .
So we decided at Stanford to build a different self-driving car .
We built the hardware and the software .
Yet I still hadn &apos;t saved a single life .
We &apos;ve driven 140,000 miles .
It &apos;s the perfect driving mechanism .
We &apos;ve driven in cities , like in San Francisco here .
Oh , my God .
What ?
Second It &apos;s driving itself .
You could regain this time .
This is four billion hours wasted in this country alone .
And it &apos;s 2.4 billion gallons of gasoline wasted .
Thank you .
Derek Sivers : Keep your goals to yourself
Everyone , please think of your biggest personal goal .
Imagine deciding right now that you &apos;re going to do it .
Imagine their congratulations and their high image of you .
Doesn &apos;t it feel good to say it out loud ?
So , let &apos;s look at the proof .
So , if this is true , what can we do ?
Well , you could resist the temptation to announce your goal .
Exactly , well done .
John Francis : Walk the earth ... my 17-year vow of silence
Thank you for being here .
And I said , &quot; Thank you for being here . &quot;
Well , I want to take you on this journey .
That &apos;s a big thing in California .
You &apos;re walking to make us feel bad . &quot;
Because of the oil , everybody talked about the polllution .
I called my parents up .
I didn &apos;t know about the environment then .
They &apos;re back in Philadelphia .
Mothers are like that .
And so I did .
And what I heard , it kind of disturbed me .
And then I would launch in .
Well , that just ended communication .
So on this first day I actually listened .
I was 27 . I thought I knew everything .
I didn &apos;t .
Well , that lasted 17 years .
It &apos;s only 500 miles .
I had a newspaper clipping .
You don &apos;t … ?
We have a special program for you . &quot; They did .
And my father came out , he was so proud .
I said I &apos;d be there in about two years .
There are two stories in Montana .
And they said , &quot; Don &apos;t worry about that . &quot;
So I did that .
And during that time , I actually taught classes without speaking .
I had 13 students when I first walked into the class .
All the students sat around and they went ...
They had to take that class with me .
&quot; Well , you can &apos;t clearcut with a ... &quot;
&quot; Yes , you can clear cut ... &quot;
And so I went on .
I spent two years there writing on oil spills .
No one was interested in oil spills .
But something happened -- Exxon Valdez .
My dad came out again .
Well , I put on my backpack again .
And that &apos;s communication .
Well , my journey kept going on .
&quot; Yeah , I want to make a difference . &quot;
&quot; You &apos;re going to make a difference , buddy . &quot;
How could that be , how could that be ?
I started talking because I had studied environment .
And so that &apos;s the message that I had .
And I started walking off .
What possessed me to say this thing ?
The road turned into the jungle .
I didn &apos;t get shot .
I was a prisoner and I needed to escape .
Now how could that be ?
I had no idea I would have a Ph.D.
You know , we can do it .
I was going to have to change .
I didn &apos;t know who I would be if I changed .
But I know I needed to .
We have to change now .
Thank you .
Arthur Benjamin : Teach statistics before calculus !
And it would be easy to implement and inexpensive .
And at top of that pyramid , it &apos;s calculus .
It &apos;s one of the great products of the human mind .
The laws of nature are written in the language of calculus .
It &apos;s risk . It &apos;s reward . It &apos;s randomness .
It &apos;s understanding data .
Not only -- thank you -- not only that ...
It &apos;s analyzing trends . It &apos;s predicting the future .
Look , the world has changed from analog to digital .
Thank you very much .
Stephen Wolfram : Computing a theory of all knowledge
It &apos;s the idea of computation .
But there &apos;s actually a lot more to computation than that .
But what about the space of all possible programs ?
Here &apos;s a representation of a really simple program .
Very simple .
Now we get another result , still very simple .
Try changing it again .
You get something a little bit more complicated .
So the question is : Can anything else happen ?
Well , we can do a little experiment .
They &apos;re called cellular automata .
You can see a lot of diversity in the behavior here .
So here it is .
Things with rules as simple as these can do it .
People like Leibniz had wondered about that too 300 years earlier .
So let &apos;s give it a try .
Let &apos;s start off with something really easy .
Hope for the best .
Very good . Okay .
So far so good .
Let &apos;s try something a little bit harder .
We could ask it something about the real world .
And it should be able to tell us that .
let &apos;s say the revenue of Microsoft .
So let &apos;s say we have a lab finding that ...
But that &apos;s just the beginning .
So , I &apos;m pretty pleased with it all .
You know , we have a fairly interesting situation right now .
Let me show you a couple of examples here .
So here &apos;s a trivial piece of Mathematica programming .
But it &apos;s something that is very precise stuff .
So what happens when you put these things together ?
I think it &apos;s actually rather wonderful .
Here &apos;s a real simple example .
Let &apos;s try this here .
I &apos;ll show you one example here .
This is just an example of one of these computable documents .
There &apos;s an inexhaustible supply of programs out there .
So , will we find the whole of physics ?
Not an easy project .
One &apos;s got to build a lot of technology .
Thank you .
That was astonishing .
Stay here . I &apos;ve got a question .
Benoit Mandelbrot is in the audience .
Does your work relate to his ?
SW : I think so .
Stephen Wolfram , thank you .
Aditi Shankardass : A second opinion on developmental disorders
And it was while I was doing my Ph.D.
But here &apos;s what really perplexed me .
It seemed so intuitive to me .
It turned out that Justin was almost certainly not autistic .
One more mind will be unlocked .
And all this by simply watching the child &apos;s brainwaves .
Thank you .
Jonathan Drori : Why we &apos;re storing billions of seeds
All human life , all life , depends on plants .
Just think for a moment .
All these things , they come back to plants .
And without them we wouldn &apos;t be here .
Now plants are under threat .
They &apos;re under threat because of changing climate .
I think it does .
is by storing seeds .
But it goes down below ground many stories .
And it &apos;s the largest seed bank in the world .
This is a nuclear-proof facility .
God forbid that it should have to withstand that .
And those are the dry land species .
So first of all we did deals with 50 different countries .
They search for them . They find them in flower .
And they go back when their seeds have arrived .
And they collect the seeds . All over the world .
The seeds -- some of if is very untechnical .
And this is a distributed network .
So all around the world people are doing the same thing .
And that enables us to develop germination protocols .
And that is very useful information .
And that &apos;s already happening .
So where have we got to ?
Twenty-five percent of all the world &apos;s plants , by 2020 .
This is at least 100 times bigger .
These seeds are used for restoration .
Fantastically useful plant , both for protein and for medicine .
How much does it cost ?
2,800 dollars per species is the average .
I think that &apos;s cheap , at the price .
And we &apos;re almost there .
Thank you very much .
Hillel Cooperman : Legos for grownups
So , these are the Dark Ages .
That stuff &apos;s cool . &quot;
Walked into the Lego store .
Bought him this .
It &apos;s totally appropriate for a four-year-old .
Pretty soon it got a little bit out of control .
The dining room looked like this .
You walk there , and it hurts .
Torture , very funny .
Wow , you guys are great .
I was like , &quot; Yeah .
I suppose we are . &quot;
Whatever .
So then you realize there are these conventions .
And you &apos;re like , &quot; Holy shit !
Just beautiful .
I &apos;m coming out .
And it &apos;s pretty amazing actually .
I have to take a moment .
Okay . Anyway .
The insides were Lego .
This is amazing what you can do .
This is my house .
And this is my house .
Anyway , I &apos;m out of time .
Because there aren &apos;t enough TED logos around here .
Let &apos;s see here .
Okay .
Ta-da .
Ross Lovegrove : Organic design , inspired by nature
I was hanging on to have a pee .
I &apos;m in that world , but I work purely instinctively .
So , the water bottle .
I &apos;ll begin with this concept of what I call DNA .
Industrial design is the art form of the 21st century .
I work from a similar position .
It &apos;s my impression of water .
I use , now , a whole new process .
This is all created digitally .
This is the background noise of industrial design .
That is like an Anish Kapoor flowing through a Richard Serra .
It felt like nothing . It has to feel like nothing .
It fits arthritic hands . It fits children &apos;s hands .
It makes the product strong , the tessellation .
It &apos;s a millefiori of ideas .
It doesn &apos;t look as cool , does it ?
I took this video in Cape Town last year .
This is the freaky side coming out .
How do you condense that ?
It comes back to instinct .
It &apos;s a weird , kind of freaky place .
This is one of my specimens .
It &apos;s made from polysaccharides and proteins .
If you pour water on that , it dissolves .
Could we be manufacturing from foodstuffs in the future ?
It &apos;s the world &apos;s first chair made in magnesium .
This is an absolutely beautiful way of working .
It &apos;s a godly way of working .
It &apos;s organic and it &apos;s essential .
This is an idea for a gas-injected , one-piece polymer chair .
It takes away anything extraneous . That &apos;s what I do .
I make organic things which are essential .
I set out to look at natural forms .
This is a show that &apos;s currently on in Tokyo .
In his day , he was the highest taxpayer in Britain .
That is the power of organic design .
This is my artwork . This is all my process .
These actually are sold as artwork .
I &apos;ll tell you about that later .
It &apos;s for a company called Moroso in Italy .
It &apos;s a gas-injected polymer chair .
The coring out of the back lets you breathe .
This is some current work I &apos;m doing .
I have a big show with Phillips Auctioneers .
Single-surface products . Furniture &apos;s a good one .
How you grow legs out of a surface .
I don &apos;t know . If I just got some time .
What is our dream ? How do we beat Apple ? &quot;
What a waste . Anyway .
That is an image of a car for me .
Cars are all wrong .
I &apos;m going to show you something a bit weird now .
They laughed everywhere over the world I showed this .
The only place that didn &apos;t laugh was Moscow .
Its cars are made from 30,000 components .
It opens and closes like a bread bin .
You plug them in . Off you jolly well go .
You see that thing . You do .
You do and not anaesthetized , separated from life .
Can you imagine ? A car on a stick .
And that &apos;s what I do with my furniture .
I &apos;m not putting Charles Eames &apos; furniture in buildings anymore .
Forget that . We move on .
I &apos;m trying to build furniture that fits architecture .
I &apos;m trying to build transportation systems .
This is the steriolithography of a staircase .
I built this thing for my studio .
It cost me 250,000 dollars to build this .
This is the data that goes with that . Incredibly complex .
Lean , efficient things . Healthy products .
Modern materials allow us to do modern things .
This is a shot in the studio .
This is how it looks pretty much every day .
Who cares ?
That &apos;s my studio . It &apos;s subterranean .
It has a lighting system that changes throughout the day .
You never see architects or designers showing you their real world .
This is called a &quot; Plasnet . &quot;
It &apos;s a bio-polycarbonate new chair I &apos;m doing in Italy .
World &apos;s first bamboo bike with folding handlebars .
We should all be riding one of these .
The first sculptural model I made for that thing in Tokyo .
It &apos;s made from Kevlar .
We need to have a new instinct for the 21st century .
We need to combine all this stuff .
These are my sculptures .
A copper jelly mold .
So , it &apos;s going to end .
Thank you , James , for your great inspiration .
Thank you very much .
Beverly + Dereck Joubert : Life lessons from big cats
And here &apos;s a prime example .
Well , we needn &apos;t have worried .
And right now this is in the Okavango Delta in Botswana .
And surprisingly , it became a cult film .
But that &apos;s not always easy for us .
Sleep deprivation is extreme .
I had tears rolling down my cheeks .
And I do believe you should stay with us .
And you can see the start of it here .
This elephant , against overwhelming odds , simply gives up hope .
Now back to the leopard .
These are precious to us , these divides .
So we knew we had to react quickly .
It was like watching a graduation ceremony .
We felt like we were surrogate parents .
DJ : Okay , so she was a little bit rough .
But in fact , what we were seeing here was interesting .
They ended up sleeping for hours .
We had to deal with these individual personalities .
We had to deal with them with respect and celebrate them .
Leopards have plummeted from 700,000 down to a mere 50,000 .
It &apos;s simply not sustainable .
DJ : There &apos;s a burgeoning bone trade .
South Africa just released some lion bones onto the market .
I call it complacency -- our complacency .
They &apos;re essential to the habitat .
If they disappear , whole ecosystems in Africa disappear .
There &apos;s an 80-billion-dollar-a-year ecotourism revenue stream into Africa .
If they disappear , all of that goes away .
That is the situation we &apos;re in -- the last lions .
And Legadema ?
BJ / DJ : Thank you very much .
BLA My journey to yo-yo mastery
When I was 14 years old , I had low self-esteem .
I felt I was not talented at anything .
One day , I bought a yo-yo .
When I tried my first trick , it looked like this .
A bit better .
I found my passion .
I was spending all my time practicing .
And I won .
I realized society didn &apos;t value my passion .
I felt I was not alive anymore .
I passed an audition for Cirque du Soleil .
Luca Turin : The science of scent
So what you &apos;re smelling now is the top note .
I will show it to you .
And after that , the complete fragrance .
And do not get the impression that this is very subjective .
You are all smelling pretty much the same thing , OK ?
Smell has this reputation of being somewhat different for each person .
It &apos;s not really true .
But the first theory is : it must be the shape .
And the other theory is that we smell molecular vibrations .
Now , this is a totally insane idea .
Here &apos;s how shape works in normal receptors .
The way --I expect everybody to memorize these compounds .
Working for a fragrance company .
Because there &apos;s a lot of money in sandalwoods .
So this is a profoundly inefficient process .
A theory is something that enables you to do less work .
This is cis-3-hexene-1-ol . It smells of cut grass .
It &apos;s very hard to explain this by molecular recognition .
S-H , quite a different frequency .
If you look on this , imagine a piano keyboard .
You have a unique smell , a unique vibration .
The bad news is they &apos;re rocket fuels .
And this is the main objection to the theory .
This is a joke . I &apos;m a biologist , OK ?
So it &apos;s a joke against myself .
Unlike us , they won &apos;t fall off the cliff .
And so that &apos;s a direct path to making new odorants .
And it is the classic synthetic aroma chemical , OK ?
And the prediction is it should smell of coumarin .
They made it ... and it smelled exactly like coumarin .
And this is our new baby , called tonkene .
And people are very resistant to ideas , and rightly so .
Why should new ideas be accepted ?
And people often ask me , is your theory accepted ?
But we &apos;re not actually doing it by astrology .
Thank you very much .
Marvin Minsky : Health and the human mind
Most people will say , &quot; Emotions are terribly hard .
But that &apos;s not the hard part . &quot;
So here &apos;s a list of problems that come up .
One nice problem is , what do we do about health ?
Or maybe it was 31 and a quarter percent .
Education : how do we improve education ?
Pollution , energy shortage , environmental diversity , poverty .
How do we make stable societies ? Longevity .
Okay , there &apos;re lots of problems to worry about .
And then notice that a great many of these problems disappear .
The problem is , how many people should there be ?
And it &apos;s a sort of choice we have to make .
Timesharing is a little further off in the future .
The future must have some computers . &quot;
Therefore , we have to build super intelligent machines like HAL .
So one thing we can do is live longer .
So that &apos;s one way of going about it .
Which , by chimpanzee standards , is very good indeed .
And so there won &apos;t be any workforce .
So I see emotions as highly evolved subsets of your capability .
Thank you .
Taylor Wilson : Yup , I built a nuclear fusion reactor
So my name is Taylor Wilson .
So nuclear fusion is our energy future .
That is the inside of my nuclear fusion reactor .
I decided I wanted to make a star .
I don &apos;t see any nuclear power plants with fusion energy .
Well it doesn &apos;t break even .
I built this in my garage .
And I &apos;ve developed a system to produce medical isotopes .
So that &apos;s my fusion reactor in the background there .
That is me at the control panel of my fusion reactor .
So maybe I don &apos;t want to admit to that .
So thank you very much .
Luis von Ahn : Massive-scale online collaboration
How many of you found it really , really annoying ?
Okay , outstanding . So I invented that .
Or I was one of the people who did it .
That thing is called a CAPTCHA .
CAPTCHAs are used all over the Internet .
So this is an example from the Yahoo registration page .
This person thought they needed to wait .
So let me tell you what this project started .
But then I started feeling bad .
So then I started feeling bad .
Your brain is doing something that computers cannot yet do .
So let me explain how this works .
Google has one . The Internet Archive has one .
You &apos;ve seen those things , right ? Like a book ?
It gives you an image for every page of the book .
Now the problem is that OCR is not perfect .
So this is how the system works .
So for example , Ticketmaster .
Twitter and about 350,000 other sites are all using reCAPTCHA .
So funny things can happen .
For example , we presented this word .
So we get this .
Oops .
Here &apos;s another really bad one .
JohnEdwards.com So we keep on insulting people left and right everyday .
Now , of course , we &apos;re not just insulting people .
I &apos;m sure some of you have heard about it .
Here &apos;s how it works .
That &apos;s how it works .
There are tens of thousands of these .
Some of them are very cute .
Some of them are funnier .
Okay , so this is my favorite number of reCAPTCHA .
And it is numbers like these that motivate my research agenda .
It hasn &apos;t yet been launched . It &apos;s called Duolingo .
Since it hasn &apos;t been launched , shhhhh !
Yeah , I can trust you &apos;ll do that .
So this is the project . Here &apos;s how it started .
Okay , that &apos;s Severin Hacker .
So I posed the question to my graduate student .
First of all , translating the Web .
So right now the Web is partitioned into multiple languages .
A large fraction of it is in English .
So that &apos;s what I would like to do .
Why can &apos;t we use machine translation ?
Why can &apos;t we use it to translate the whole Web ?
It makes a lot of mistakes .
Actually it was a forum post .
It was translated from Japanese into English .
So I &apos;ll just let you read .
So he &apos;s just explaining something .
Remember , it &apos;s a question about JavaScript .
Then comes the first part of the question .
Then comes my favorite part of the question .
Okay , so computer translation , not yet good enough .
So back to the question .
So we need people to translate the whole Web .
We could pay professional language translators to translate the whole Web .
We could do that .
Unfortunately , it would be extremely expensive .
It &apos;s about 20 percent of the size of English .
So it would be very expensive .
The first one is a lack of bilinguals .
That &apos;s a big problem .
Normally , you have to pay people to do this .
There &apos;s a way to kill two birds with one stone .
there are over 1.2 billion people learning a foreign language .
People really , really want to learn a foreign language .
So people really , really want to learn a new language .
And so basically they &apos;re learning by doing .
But at all times , you &apos;re learning by doing .
People really can learn a language with it .
So people really do learn a language .
So people really do learn a language .
So let me show you one example .
This is a sentence that was translated from German into English .
The top is the German .
You can see , it &apos;s pretty much perfect .
Remember , this is 50 million dollars-worth of value .
That &apos;s the current business model .
So it &apos;s extremely unfair towards the poor .
This is totally biased towards the rich .
So this is how we could monetize this .
So here &apos;s the site . Thank you .
So here &apos;s the site .
We haven &apos;t yet launched this Duolingo .
So thank you .
Denise Herzing : Could we speak the language of dolphins ?
Well , we know a few things .
Cognitively , they can understand artificially-created languages .
And they pass self-awareness tests in mirrors .
And most of our work &apos;s pretty non-invasive .
Now the mother you see here is Mugsy .
Now , dolphins are natural acousticians .
But they have other communication signals they use .
They have taste , not smell .
And they have touch .
So dolphins can buzz and tickle each other at a distance .
Another well studied sound are echolocation clicks .
This is the dolphin &apos;s sonar .
And they use these clicks to hunt and feed .
You know , I &apos;ve been buzzed in the water .
Don &apos;t tell anyone . It &apos;s a secret .
Now this is some video of a typical dolphin fight .
There &apos;s a bubble .
For example , they babysit each other &apos;s calves .
I wish I was that coordinated .
But burst-pulsed sounds is a bit of a mystery .
Now , these are three spectragrams .
Two are human words , and one is a dolphin vocalizing .
Now in this footage , the adult is Caroh .
She &apos;s kind of teasing him and taunting him .
He really wants that sargassum .
They &apos;ve got better things to do in the wild .
And these are artificially created whistles .
And the dolphins could get in on the game .
Now this is video of a session .
You have to keep their attention .
Let &apos;s see if they might actually understand what that means .
That &apos;s the rope whistle .
So this is only once .
Okay , so here &apos;s a second toy in the water .
And I &apos;m trying to lead her back to the keyboard .
So I try to give her the scarf .
Whoop . Almost lost it .
But this is the moment where everything becomes possible .
The dolphin &apos;s at the keyboard .
You &apos;ve got full attention .
And this sometimes went on for hours .
Now , how far can this kind of communication go ?
It &apos;s designed to really be two-way .
Now , will they learn to mimic the whistles functionally ?
We hope so and we think so .
Thank you .
Thomas Heatherwick : Building the Seed Cathedral
Hello , my name is Thomas Heatherwick .
And this influenced me .
The first building I built was 20 years ago .
This is a hospital building .
This is a shop for a bag company .
This is studios for artists .
And this is a window display .
And this is a temple in Japan for a Buddhist monk .
And this is a cafe by the sea in Britain .
But they aren &apos;t in London .
And so you &apos;re stuck on a bus .
So it &apos;s got hybrid drive .
I was going to show four main projects .
And this is a project for a bridge .
I think we all kind of stand and watch .
And so this is in Paddington in London .
It &apos;s just steel and timber .
So that &apos;s it speeded up .
It was voted the worst place in Britain to live .
So it felt this has a social dimension .
It has a symbolic importance .
Because just that soil could make the acoustic difference .
And it &apos;s a power park .
So we won the competition to build the U.K. pavilion .
And an expo is a totally bonkers thing .
There &apos;s 250 pavilions .
So there are up to a million people there everyday .
And 250 countries all competing .
So we suddenly realized that there was this thing .
And the same with flowers .
But this phenomenal project &apos;s been happening .
But how could we show these teeny-weeny things ?
And the film &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; actually really helped us .
Thomas Heatherwick : Okay , you get the idea .
So the whole thing can gently move when the wind blows .
And to make the project affordable , we focused our energy .
And so the rest of the site was a public space .
There &apos;s just silence and a cool temperature .
A key thing was how people would interact .
And I just wanted to show you .
And there was a lot of terror .
But there was an underlying support .
Children : One , two , three , go .
TH : I &apos;m sorry about my stupid voice there .
So finally , texture is something .
So we &apos;re building these buildings .
They &apos;re actually identical , so it &apos;s quite cost-effective .
They &apos;re just chopped at different heights .
And that &apos;s my final slide .
Thank you .
Thank you .
So there were 66,000 of these .
This optic was 22 feet long .
Waterproofing the building was a bit crazy .
Thank you , Thomas .
Juan Enriquez : Your online life , permanent as a tattoo
Right ?
A few , but not most .
And electronic tattoos also shout .
Here &apos;s what happened to this company .
So what if Andy was wrong ?
Here &apos;s Andy &apos;s theory .
Why the Greeks ?
So lesson number one : Sisyphus .
It &apos;s a little like your reputation .
Lesson number three : Atalanta .
Greatest runner . She would challenge anybody .
If you won , she would marry you .
If you lost , you died .
How did Hippomenes beat her ?
She kept getting distracted . He eventually won the race .
And then , of course , there &apos;s Narcissus .
Nobody here would ever be accused or be familiar with Narcissus .
Thank you .
How web video powers global innovation
I mean , it &apos;s quite brutal .
And I &apos;m also a little nervous about this .
There are nine billion humans coming our way .
So , let &apos;s explore .
This kid is known online as Lil Demon .
How did he learn them ?
Here &apos;s a clue .
This is what he said at TED in February .
It felt like a revolution .
It was resulting in incredible new talks like these two .
What is going on here ?
You turn up the dials , the wheel starts to turn .
The bigger the crowd , the more potential innovators there are .
They &apos;re creating the ecosystem from which innovation emerges .
The second thing you need is light .
And third , you need desire .
You know , innovation &apos;s hard work .
Absent desire , not going to happen .
Best dancer walks tall , gets the best date .
There &apos;s probably going to be some innovation happening here .
The dance community is now global .
There &apos;s millions connected .
That &apos;s a lot of light .
But the desire element is really dialed way up .
You get hundreds of strangers writing excitedly about you .
Also , the system is self-fueling .
The dark side of the web is allergic to the light .
But you can publish your stuff online .
We are learning from them .
We &apos;re getting great talks back from them .
The wheel is turning .
Okay , step back a minute .
Even he said that , and he would know .
We &apos;re a social species .
We spark off each other .
Suddenly , here we are .
Humanity watches 80 million hours of YouTube every day .
I don &apos;t think it will be .
Video is high-bandwidth for a reason .
Here , let me introduce you to Sam Haber .
He &apos;s a unicyclist .
Suddenly , he starts to emulate and then to innovate .
There &apos;s a problem with a traditional scientific paper .
But look at this video .
Why do people like watching TEDTalks ?
All those ideas are already out there in print .
It &apos;s actually faster to read than to view .
Why would someone bother ?
And in that non-verbal portion , there &apos;s some serious magic .
Reading and writing are actually relatively recent inventions .
Face-to-face communication has been fine-tuned by millions of years of evolution .
It &apos;s probably driven our culture for millennia .
It &apos;s right here .
Print scaled .
that just went global .
Now , this is big .
We may have to reinvent an ancient art form .
Now , TED is just a small part of this .
TEDTalks can &apos;t be a one-way process , one-to-many .
Our future is many-to-many .
Why not a self-fueling cycle in which we all can participate ?
It &apos;s the participation age , right ?
Schools can &apos;t be silos .
We can &apos;t stop learning at age 21 .
What if , in the coming crowd of nine billion ...
That changes everything , right ?
But the good news is they are out there .
Who &apos;s the teacher ?
You &apos;re the teacher .
It &apos;s not crazy ; it &apos;s actually happening right now .
Christopher Makau : Hi . My name is Christopher Makau .
I &apos;m one of the organizers of TEDxKibera .
There &apos;s a self-help group .
They turned a trash place into a garden .
They used the same trash to form green manure .
The same trash site is feeding more than 30 families .
We have our own film school .
Change happens when we see things in a different way .
Today , I see Kibera in a different way .
You know what ?
I bet Chris has always been an inspiring guy .
Guys , we &apos;ve learned from you today .
Thank you .
And thank you .
Aimee Mullins : My 12 pairs of legs
But , of course , that &apos;s the point .
And immediately a voice shouted , &quot; Kangaroo ! &quot;
&quot; No . It should be Go Go Gadget ! &quot;
Somebody that might even be super-abled .
Interesting .
And also these very life-like , intrinsically painted silicone legs .
This started an incredible journey .
You don &apos;t look disabled . &quot;
What does a beautiful woman have to look like ?
What is a sexy body ?
Nobody calls her disabled .
Nobody knew -- everyone thought they were wooden boots .
Poetry matters .
I learned this firsthand with my next adventure .
Heavy !
That &apos;s a good close-up of that one .
So whimsy matters .
Today , I &apos;m 6 &apos; 1 &quot; .
And I was having fun with it .
And the incredible thing was she really meant it .
It is no longer a conversation about overcoming deficiency .
It &apos;s a conversation about augmentation .
It &apos;s a conversation about potential .
Thank you .
Anna Deavere Smith : Four American characters
You see , we also have the technology .
I say , less and less the human touch .
Now we have humans imitating robots .
Concourse Two : Dallas , Fort Worth . Same voice .
And so suddenly they &apos;re looking at me .
I mean , Huck , of course , was tremendous .
So the human touch , you see , it &apos;s disappearing .
And that &apos;s Studs Terkel .
So this piece is about a negative imagination .
And I got this in the Maryland Correctional Institute for Women .
Everything I do is word for word off a tape .
And this is an inmate named Paulette Jenkins .
I want everybody to think we were a normal family .
I &apos;m just talking about the particular night that she died .
And it didn &apos;t work , didn &apos;t work .
I didn &apos;t even go and see what was happening .
I just sat there and listened .
And then he put her in the hallway .
And then he told her , get up .
Her face was bruised . She had a black eye .
&quot; The next morning she was dead .
My own child , I let that happen to . &quot;
So that &apos;s an investigation of the negative imagination .
Everybody thought the four cops would go to jail .
They did not , so there were riots .
Explosion of joy that this verdict had come back this way .
And this is called , &quot; Swallowing the Bitterness . &quot;
&quot; I used to believe America was the best .
I watched in Korea many luxurious Hollywood lifestyle movie .
I never saw any poor man , any black .
Why ? Why do we have to be left out ?
And we are high taxpayer . Where do I find justice ?
&quot; OK . OK ? OK . OK .
Many African-Americans probably think that they won by the trial .
They got their rights by destroying innocent Korean merchants .
&quot; But what about 1992 ? They destroyed innocent people .
They became so hilarious , but I was happy for them .
I wish that I could live together with black people .
But after the riot , it &apos;s too much difference .
Igniting , igniting , igniting fire . Igniting fire .
It &apos;s still there ; it can burst out anytime . &quot;
Mrs. Young-Soon Han .
And this is called &quot; Toughness . &quot;
I think that &apos;s good luck .
&quot; And , I mean , funny things like this happen .
She said , &apos; Look who she is .
&quot; Freedom ? It would have to be the rodeo .
Thank you .
Aaron Koblin : Visualizing ourselves ... with crowd-sourced data
So I think data can actually make us more human .
And I believe this is going to prove true .
This is a project called Flight Patterns .
Everybody &apos;s moving from the East coast to the West coast .
You can also toggle between altitude for model and manufacturer .
See again , the diversity .
This is scrolling up the East coast .
This is looking at ascending versus descending flights .
And you can see , eventually the airport actually flips directions .
This is visualizing international communications .
So it &apos;s how New York communicates with other international cities .
And then you can see people celebrating the next day .
So now on to something completely different .
Some of you may recognize this .
This is Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen &apos;s mechanical chess playing machine .
I can tap into thousands of people &apos;s minds . &quot;
I was probably being a little extreme .
So I created this drawing tool .
I asked people to draw a sheep facing to the left .
And I started collecting sheep .
And I collected a lot , a lot of different sheep .
Lots of sheep .
Kind of amazing what some people did .
So here &apos;s a few statistics from the project .
But only one of them out of the 7,599 said this .
Which I was pretty surprised by .
And I think it &apos;s a pretty valid question .
And there &apos;s a lot of reasons why I chose sheep .
Obviously , we think of sheep as followers .
He draws sheep after sheep .
The narrator &apos;s only appeased when he draws a box .
It &apos;s about your own interpretation and doing something different . &quot;
And I like that .
We asked people to draw what it was that they saw .
But here there was no sheep-like criteria .
This is again showing all the different contributions .
And other people would draw stick figures or smiley faces .
That &apos;s all I &apos;m getting paid for this ?
This is a collaboration with my friend Daniel Massey .
You may recognize these two guys .
So we resynthesized this song .
This is what that sounded like .
You &apos;d be fed a simple audio clip .
I &apos;m sorry for this .
And I was writing software to visualize laser scanners .
So basically motion through 3D space .
So we did exactly that .
And people were making some amazing things .
A whole YouTube channel of people submitting really interesting content .
And I met a music video director named Chris Milk .
As you know , an animation is a series of images .
One is the beginning of the music video .
Collaborator : I felt really sad when he died .
You &apos;re hearing a person &apos;s life .
And you can also see the way that it was drawn .
Again , you can get the playback and personal contribution .
But there &apos;s a bunch of different styles .
And you can sort the video a number of different ways .
And this is called &quot; The Wilderness Downtown . &quot;
It &apos;s an online music video for the Arcade Fire .
Thanks a lot .
Donald Sadoway : The missing link to renewable energy
But coal plants , nuclear plants can &apos;t respond fast enough .
A giant battery could .
You see , the battery is the key enabling device here .
And that changes everything .
Today I want to tell you about such a device .
It &apos;s called the liquid metal battery .
Now let &apos;s get started .
The science is that simple .
Admittedly , I &apos;ve left out a few details .
We need to think about the problem differently .
We need to think big , we need to think cheap .
This battery needs to be made out of earth-abundant elements .
I &apos;m talking about the production of aluminum .
Volta &apos;s battery works at room temperature .
That &apos;s the economic miracle of modern electrometallurgy .
And I did .
I &apos;ll show you how .
So now , how to choose the metals ?
And that includes our own bodies .
Magnesium for the top layer .
And antimony for the bottom layer .
It could be something like a wind farm .
And then we reverse the current .
It &apos;s pretty cool , at least in theory .
But does it really work ?
So what to do next ?
We go to the laboratory .
Now do I hire seasoned professionals ?
So this is the evolution of the liquid metal battery .
We start here with our workhorse one watt-hour cell .
I called it the shotglass .
Along the way we scaled up to the 20 watt-hour cell .
I call it the hockey puck .
And we got the same remarkable results .
And then it was onto the saucer .
That &apos;s 200 watt-hours .
The technology was proving itself to be robust and scalable .
But the pace wasn &apos;t fast enough for us .
We call that the pizza .
It &apos;s going to be 36 inches in diameter .
So what have we learned from all this ?
So what have we learned from all this ?
They lie beyond the visible .
Avoid thermal runaway .
Scaling : Conventional wisdom says reduce cost by producing many .
Malcolm Gladwell : Choice , happiness and spaghetti sauce
And by profession , he &apos;s a psychophysicist .
Which should tell you something about that relationship .
As far as I know , psychophysics is about measuring things .
And Howard is very interested in measuring things .
In fact , the data doesn &apos;t make any sense .
It &apos;s a mess . It &apos;s all over the place .
Howard is not so easily placated .
Howard is a man of a certain degree of intellectual standards .
This was an enormous revelation .
You should be looking for the perfect Pepsis . &quot;
This was his horseradish . He was obsessed with it !
And that &apos;s where we got zesty pickles .
That &apos;s called &quot; adherence . &quot;
So he said , this is what I want to do .
And then he analyzed the data .
Howard doesn &apos;t believe that there is such a thing .
Let &apos;s see if they congregate around certain ideas .
Now why is that important ?
People don &apos;t know what they want ! Right ?
It &apos;s a mystery !
What do you like ? Dark , rich , hearty roast !
Most of you like milky , weak coffee .
So that &apos;s number one thing that Howard did .
Grey Poupon came along , with a Dijon . Right ?
Takes over the mustard business !
A better mustard ! A more expensive mustard !
A mustard of more sophistication and culture and meaning .
And Howard looked to that and said , that &apos;s wrong !
Mustard does not exist on a hierarchy .
There is no good mustard or bad mustard .
There is no perfect mustard or imperfect mustard .
He fundamentally democratized the way we think about taste .
What do I mean by that ?
This is the way it ought to be .
Now that same idea fueled the commercial food industry as well .
And where did that come from ? It came from Italy .
The culture of tomato sauce was thin .
And that &apos;s what would please the maximum number of people .
They were looking for one way to treat all of us .
But that changed , right ?
I guess my cancer different from your cancer .
Genetics has opened the door to the study of human variability .
And the example he used was coffee .
Thank you .
Joel Selanikio : The surprising seeds of a big-data revolution in healthcare
The guys says he &apos;s looking for his keys .
And this is about a 5,000-year-old technology .
Some of you may have used it before .
Do you have any children ? Were your children vaccinated ? &quot;
We have paper forms for vaccination surveys .
We have paper forms to track people who come into clinics .
And millions of children die of these diseases every year .
Now try and wrap your head around that for a second .
You just had teams of hundreds of people .
They went out into the field to answer a particular question .
The process just stops . Happens all the time .
Now 1995 , obviously that was quite a long time ago .
It was a Palm Pilot .
So that &apos;s actually what I began to do .
And it actually worked great .
It worked exactly as well as anybody would have predicted .
There are schools that need to track attendance .
So what do I mean by that ?
That means you had to know I existed .
So these guys are distributing technology .
I need to think about this some more .
They don &apos;t require any programmers .
And that &apos;s exactly what we did .
No one has to speak to me .
And it doesn &apos;t have to be a smartphone .
But there are some additional benefits as well .
Unbelievable improvements in efficiency .
Cloud-based , no training , no consultants , no me .
What happened after we did this ?
And I think it should be obvious .
Thank you .
Rory Sutherland : Sweat the small stuff
So there seems to be a complete disconnect here .
Let me give you one example of this .
It may still be , for all I know .
Has anybody stayed there ?
It actually says garage , funk , rhythm and blues .
Now , these are trivial marketing examples , I accept .
It &apos;s a tiny , tiny thing .
But everything about institutions makes them uncomfortable with that disproportionality .
I tried this exercise recently , talking about banking .
They said , &quot; Can we do an advertising campaign ?
What can we do and encourage more online banking ? &quot;
I said , &quot; It &apos;s really , really easy . &quot;
Why would you willingly expose yourself to bad news ?
Okay , you simply wouldn &apos;t .
And yet , it never happens .
That &apos;s the world people actually want .
And I &apos;d be wrong to dis that completely .
Moving over , we come , of course , to consultancy .
I mean , Tiger surely was actually obeying the Accenture model .
That &apos;s called trivia .
But there &apos;s a fourth thing .
We don &apos;t know what to call it .
Thank you very much .
Kristen Ashburn : The face of AIDS in Africa
For instance , this is Herbert with his grandmother .
This is Joyce who &apos;s -- in this picture -- 21 .
Single mother , HIV positive .
So a few of the stories .
All these pictures are from Zimbabwe .
Kirsten Ashburn : Mmm , gosh .
It was just frightening .
That &apos;s an amazing story , thank you .
KB : Thanks for letting me show these .
Alessandro Acquisti : What will a future without secrets look like ?
You know the incident .
They freak out .
And the rest is history .
Nowadays , Adam and Eve would probably act differently .
And my story is about these tradeoffs .
Do you see the subject ?
But a few years back , we did something else .
Do you see where I &apos;m going with this ?
Of course , the accuracy keeps getting worse .
And should we care ?
Or in a parallel universe , you find this information .
Discrimination was happening through social media for equally skilled candidates .
But think again . Why should that be always the case ?
And in principle , that &apos;s a very good thing .
It &apos;s necessary , but it is not sufficient .
Transparency can be misdirected .
It makes sense , right ?
But then we added the misdirection .
Ten minutes ?
Five minutes ?
One minute ?
How about 15 seconds ?
We can browse the Internet anonymously .
We can have even privacy-preserving data mining .
Which brings me back to the Garden of Eden .
In the garden , Adam and Eve are materially content .
They &apos;re happy . They are satisfied .
However , they also lack knowledge and self-awareness .
They become aware . They achieve autonomy .
The price to pay , however , is leaving the garden .
We get free content .
We get to play Angry Birds . We get targeted apps .
Thank you .
May El-Khalil : Making peace is a marathon
I know what I have just said is simply not obvious .
I used to be a marathon runner .
So we had to start from scratch .
It was honesty and transparency that brought us together .
The marathon grew .
So did our political problems .
But we did have a marathon .
Government protesters became sideline cheerleaders .
They even hosted juice stations .
It gained credibility from both the Lebanese and the international community .
BMA has expanded .
Thank you .
The culture of giving and doing good has become contagious .
Stereotypes have been broken .
Change-makers and future leaders have been created .
I believe these are the building blocks for future peace .
From Boston to Beirut , we stand as one .
After all , peacemaking is not a sprint .
It is more of a marathon .
Thank you .
Sheryl WuDunn : Our century &apos;s greatest injustice
It , however , is enormous in both scale and importance .
So , let &apos;s start off in China .
This photo was taken two weeks ago .
But this is Tiananmen Square .
Let me take you to the real China .
And they share this great splendor with a very large pig .
Why would we waste this money on you ? &quot;
This is what happens to girls in remote areas .
We wrote about her in The New York Times .
He was delighted .
He thought , &quot; Oh , I can renovate the school .
So Dai Manju basically finished out middle school .
She went to high school .
She went to vocational school for accounting .
She scouted for jobs down in Guangdong province in the south .
She sent money back to her family .
What we saw was a natural experiment .
The village became a real standout .
In the 19th century , it was slavery .
In the 20th century , it was totalitarianism .
She &apos;s exaggerating . &quot;
Well , let me ask you this question .
Hands up , please .
Okay , most of you .
Well , you know this latter group , you &apos;re wrong .
And , you know , it happens for several reasons .
Sometimes it &apos;s also because of the sonogram .
The entire center was filled with girls like her .
Poverty , for instance .
There are three reasons why this is the case .
The second reason is it has to do with spending .
alcohol , tobacco , sugary drinks -- and prostitution and festivals .
You need to use scarce resources .
He was speaking to an audience much like yourselves .
However , two-thirds of the way there was a barrier .
Do you think we &apos;ll make it ? &quot;
So here is Bill of Arabia .
So what would some of the specific challenges look like ?
And I &apos;ll just say two things about this .
The second item on the agenda is maternal mortality .
And the most devastating injury is obstetric fistula .
Let me tell you about Mahabuba .
She lives in Ethiopia .
She was married against her will at age 13 .
The baby died , and she ended up with a fistula .
In a word , she stank .
That night , there was a stick in the hut .
She fought off the hyenas with that stick .
She has become part of the solution , not the problem .
I &apos;ve hinted at them : education and also economic opportunity .
With economic opportunity , it can be transformative .
Let me tell you about Saima .
She lives in a small village outside Lahore , Pakistan .
And at the time , she was miserable .
Saima &apos;s not going to produce you a son . &quot;
This is when she had her second daughter .
Saima took that money , and she started an embroidery business .
So now they &apos;re in it together .
Which brings me to the final element , which is education .
Let me tell you about Beatrice Biira .
Heifer sent two goats to Africa .
The twins started producing milk .
They sold the milk for cash .
No matter , she was just delighted to be in school .
She rocketed to the top of her class .
Two years ago , she graduated from Connecticut College .
And that goat was $ 120 .
So you see how transformative little bits of help can be .
But I want to give you a reality check .
There &apos;s Bill Easterly &apos;s book .
There &apos;s a book called &quot; Dead Aid . &quot;
He sort of mumbled .
Turns out that it &apos;s a failed irrigation project .
A few yards away was a failed chicken coop .
You learn from your mistakes , and you continuously improve .
You &apos;re probably asking that . Why should you care ?
I will just leave you with two things .
And that is the story of an aid worker in Darfur .
She never broke down .
What that was was a bird feeder .
And she realized that with that great fortune comes great responsibility .
So , here &apos;s the cause .
Join the movement .
Feel happier and help save the world .
Thank you very much .
Francis Collins : We need better drugs -- now
So let me ask for a show of hands .
How many people here are over the age of 48 ?
Well , there do seem to be a few .
But look what happened in the course of that century .
There &apos;s that dip there for the 1918 flu .
Now , that &apos;s the good news .
But there &apos;s still a lot of work to do .
Only about 250 .
So we have this huge challenge , this huge gap .
Unfortunately , it &apos;s not .
There are no shiny bridges .
You sort of place your bets .
Well , what does this really look like ?
Well , what is it to make a therapeutic , anyway ?
Is it going to land where it &apos;s supposed to ?
How can we make this go faster ?
How can we make it more successful ?
But it &apos;s taken a long time to get there .
That picture you see there ?
Here it is . That &apos;s the same kid .
That &apos;s the good news .
How do we go faster ?
Well , that &apos;s exciting .
I want to tell you about another disorder .
This one is a disorder which is quite rare .
Sam , please have a seat .
Sam Burns : Well , progeria limits me in some ways .
Please join me in thanking and welcoming Sam .
This is a drug that was developed for cancer .
That could be a phenomenal , valuable activity .
And you could expect quite a lot to come from this .
It was developed for cancer . It was AZT .
So how do we actually make that a more generalizable effort ?
Let me tell you another thing we could do .
Suppose we could do this instead on human cells .
Here you see a picture of a lung on a chip .
You can see this chip even breathes .
It has an air channel . It has a blood channel .
Are those cells happy or not ?
So let me sum up .
We are in a remarkable moment here .
This is research that &apos;s high-risk , sometimes high-cost .
And third , and maybe most important , we need talent .
I hope that &apos;s your goal .
It matters for now . It matters as soon as possible .
If you don &apos;t believe me , just ask Sam .
Thank you all very much .
Lucy McRae : How can technology transform the human body ?
I call myself a body architect .
I started my own experiments .
These are Q-tips stuck to my roommate with wig glue .
We were creating visual imagery provoking human evolution .
Or the way that we attract sexual partners ?
It &apos;s perfume coming from the inside out .
And I feel like I &apos;ve just got started .
So here &apos;s to another day at the office .
Thank you !
Thank you !
Sally Kohn : Let &apos;s try emotional correctness
So when I do my job , people hate me .
I am a progressive lesbian talking head on Fox News .
I am a gay talking head on Fox News .
So I go on television .
It &apos;s totally almost just like that .
And that &apos;s just on air .
The hate mail I get is unbelievable .
Let me give you a small example .
I care about two things .
One , I care that you spell it right .
Just quick refresher , it &apos;s D-Y-K-E .
You &apos;d totally be surprised .
Are you being friendly ? Are you just being naive ?
Or do you really want to hurt me personally ?
Political persuasion begins with being emotionally correct .
Now here &apos;s the kicker .
Conservatives are really nice .
That is emotional correctness .
I &apos;m not saying it &apos;s easy .
Now this guy doesn &apos;t agree with me , yet .
Thank you .
Seth Godin : The tribes we lead
So sometimes I get invited to give weird talks .
Unfortunately I couldn &apos;t go .
Sometimes they get in trouble , but not often .
They make balloon animals .
But what do we do for a living ?
What exactly to the people watching this do every day ?
We try to make big , permanent , important change .
But we don &apos;t think about it that way .
And I &apos;ve been studying it for a couple years .
And I want to share a couple stories with you today .
First , about a guy named Nathan Winograd .
Nathan was the number two person at the San Francisco SPCA .
And everyone said it was impossible .
They persisted . And Nathan went directly to the community .
And then he went to North Carolina and did it again .
And he went to Reno and he did it again .
It is a moment in time .
Henry Ford comes up with a really cool idea .
Because he &apos;s got an efficient enough factory .
You can change the fabric of an entire country .
Ever-cheaper labor and ever-faster machines .
Take a good idea and push it on the world .
I have a better mousetrap .
And you can build an entire industry on that .
If necessary you can put babies in your ads .
If necessary you can use babies to sell other stuff .
And if babies don &apos;t work , you can use doctors .
But be careful .
I call it the idea of tribes .
It &apos;s about leading and connecting people and ideas .
And it &apos;s something that people have wanted forever .
The Internet was supposed to homogenize everyone by connecting us all .
Instead what it &apos;s allowed is silos of interest .
So you &apos;ve got the red-hat ladies over here .
You &apos;ve got the red-hat triathletes over there .
You &apos;ve got the organized armies over here .
You &apos;ve got the disorganized rebels over here .
You &apos;ve got people in white hats making food .
And people in white hats sailing boats .
Now it turns out this is a legitimate non-photoshopped photo .
But they always stop and take a picture .
You know the pirate tribe is a fascinating one .
He did it by creating a movement .
You don &apos;t need everyone .
What it &apos;s about instead is finding the true believers .
You know , this is one of my favorite devices .
But let me just try a couple .
The Beatles did not invent teenagers .
They merely decided to lead them .
She didn &apos;t invent the idea of caring about this issue .
Bob Marley did not invent Rastafarians .
He just stepped up and said , &quot; Follow me . &quot;
Someone stands up and says , &quot; This one is important .
We need to organize around it . &quot;
And not everyone will . But you don &apos;t need everyone .
So Tony Hsieh does not run a shoe store .
Zappos isn &apos;t a shoe store .
It &apos;s exactly the same behavior though .
We &apos;re just waiting for someone to lead us . &quot;
Michelle Kaufman has pioneered new ways of thinking about environmental architecture .
By leading a movement and making change .
And around and around and around it goes .
So three questions I &apos;d offer you .
The first one is , who exactly are you upsetting ?
The second question is , who are you connecting ?
And the third one is , who are you leading ?
It &apos;s a story of a product that tells a story .
It &apos;s tens of thousands of pairs of shoes .
And the people he surrounds himself with need the connection .
They need the leadership . It makes a difference .
You don &apos;t need permission from people to lead them .
They challenge what &apos;s currently there .
The second thing is , they build a culture .
They connect people to one another .
Do you know what people want more than anything ?
They want to be missed .
They want to be missed when they &apos;re gone .
And tribe leaders can do that .
Being a leader gives you charisma .
Finally , they commit .
They commit to the cause . They commit to the tribe .
They commit to the people who are there .
So I &apos;d like you to do something for me .
Thank you very much . I appreciate it .
Lee Hotz : Inside an Antarctic time machine
Nowhere on Earth offers us such a perfect record .
It &apos;s urgent work . We know that temperatures are rising .
This past May was the warmest worldwide on record .
And we know that levels of greenhouse gases are rising too .
They have to dig themselves out every day .
It makes for an exotic and chilly commute .
It &apos;s really a time machine .
Yes , I said that with a Q , quadrillion .
Each cylinder is a parfait of time .
From this , we can detect an extraordinary number of things .
Most importantly , these cylinders and this snow trap air .
And this is the object of their scrutiny .
Why do we need to study this anymore ?
Don &apos;t we already know how they affect temperatures ?
Indeed , we run the risk of making things worse .
This process requires extraordinary precautions .
The scientists must insure that the ice is not contaminated .
Imagine juggling a snowball across the tropics .
They work against the clock and against the thermometer .
Here , the ice seems a living presence .
The wind that rubs against it gives it voice .
It is a voice of experience .
It is a voice we should heed .
Thank you .
Bill Ford : A future beyond traffic gridlock
I literally grew up with the Ford Motor Company .
So my parents would go to dinner .
And it was snowing that day .
My dad finished dinner early that evening .
So it kind of cooled my test-driving for a little while .
But I really began to love cars then .
And my first car was a 1975 electric-green Mustang .
Because he believed that with mobility comes freedom and progress .
And that &apos;s a belief that I share .
My other great passion is the environment .
And that was true until I got to college .
And I really discovered that my professors weren &apos;t completely wrong .
I had some very interesting conversations , as you can imagine .
I was considered a radical .
We &apos;re pushing fuel efficiency to new heights .
We &apos;re starting to sell electric cars , which is great .
Today there are about 800 million cars on the road worldwide .
Today the average driver in Beijing has a five-hour commute .
Well I think you probably already have the picture .
And our quality of life is going to be severely compromised .
So what &apos;s going to solve this ?
These are all really good ideas that will move us forward .
But the potential of a connected car network is almost limitless .
You know , we &apos;ve come a long way .
We don &apos;t want to regress and lose that freedom .
This is a big one , and it won &apos;t wait .
So let &apos;s get started now .
Thank you .
John Hardy : My green school dream
I had a really hard time in school .
I ran away .
It was a fairy tale , and then we retired .
It has an intact Hindu culture .
Cynthia and I were there .
We decided to give back locally .
And here it is : it &apos;s called the Green School .
The classrooms have no walls .
The teacher is writing on a bamboo blackboard .
The desks are not square .
And we practice holism .
Our children spend 181 days going to school in a box .
Would he have had more possibilities in his life ?
The classrooms have natural light .
They &apos;re beautiful . They &apos;re bamboo .
The breeze passes through them .
So we basically turned the box into a bubble .
But since that happened , they own those desks .
They know they can control their world .
And you know what these are .
There &apos;s nowhere to flush .
How many people times how much water .
There isn &apos;t enough water .
And they work . People use them . People are okay .
It &apos;s something you should think about doing .
Not many things didn &apos;t work .
We had to replace them with recyclable plastic .
The teachers dragged giant PVC whiteboards into the classrooms .
I said , &quot; Welcome to Green School . &quot;
I asked him , &quot; Why ? &quot;
In August I &apos;m bringing my sons . &quot;
This was a great thing .
It &apos;s becoming a community .
It &apos;s becoming a green model .
We had to look at everything .
No petrochemicals in the pavement .
No pavement .
These are volcanic stones laid by hand .
There are no sidewalks .
This is the school buffalo .
He &apos;s planning to eat that fence for dinner .
All the fences at Green School are green .
Landscaping .
We dropped them gently in .
This young man is picking organic vegetables .
The food is incredible .
Green School is a place of pioneers , local and global .
And it &apos;s a kind of microcosm of the globalized world .
The kids are from 25 countries .
Green School is going into its third year with 160 children .
But you also learn other things .
You learn bamboo building .
You practice ancient Balinese arts .
This is called mud wrestling in the rice fields .
The kids love it .
The mothers aren &apos;t quite convinced .
And we were right .
A woman came from Africa with music .
We need someone to come and study it .
And all the kids are thriving .
And how did we do all this ?
On giant grass .
It &apos;s bamboo .
It comes out of the ground like a train .
The yellow box was called the administration complex .
It &apos;s a double helix .
It has administrators in it and many , many other things .
So we built big models .
We had them engineered by the engineers .
It was chaos .
The heart of school has seven kilometers of bamboo in it .
Is this doable in your community ?
We believe it is .
Green School is a model we built for the world .
It &apos;s a model we built for Bali .
So , Mr. Gore , thank you .
Thank you .
Guy-Philippe Goldstein : How cyberattacks threaten real-world peace
Good afternoon .
regarding cyberattacks against the American company Google .
Many things have been said about this .
It so happens that these weapons are dangerous .
These virtual weapons can also destroy the physical world .
As a result , the Americans take the threat very seriously .
which was indeed the case in Europe between 1650 and 1750 .
Okay , but what distinguishes it from an offensive unit ?
But today both countries say the best defense is to attack .
This issue isn &apos;t just theoretical .
Estonia accused Russia .
And these preemptive attacks might not just remain in cyberspace .
Thank you .
Toby Shapshak : You don &apos;t need an app for that
Who has an Android phone ?
Who has a Blackberry ?
Who will admit in public to having a Blackberry ?
You don &apos;t have to put your hands up .
These are rhetorical .
And why did Eric Merrifield have to invent the dolos ?
Actually , it isn &apos;t .
What it is is a map of innovation .
All the places with lots of electricity , it isn &apos;t .
So where it &apos;s happening is in Africa .
This is real innovation , and I define it as problem-solving .
People are solving real problems in Africa .
Why ? Because we have to .
Because we have real problems .
Fantastic . Why do you even need a credit card ?
Something like 25 million dollars a day is transacted through M-Pesa .
And you think this is just a feature phone .
Actually it &apos;s the smartphone of Africa .
Why ? Because that &apos;s what we need .
We have really severe energy problems in Africa .
I come from Johannesburg , which is a mining town .
It &apos;s built on gold .
This is a picture I Instagrammed earlier .
Really simple , really effective , really life-saving .
Really simple , using a basic phone .
If you don &apos;t have electricity , no problem !
I believe we are the gold .
This is not that catchy catchphrase .
This is innovation over the edge .
So there &apos;s only one thing left to say .
&#91; &quot; You &apos;re welcome &quot; &#93;
Hans Rosling : The good news of the decade ?
They &apos;re called Millennium Development Goals .
So there &apos;s good news .
I &apos;ll prove them wrong on both points .
Come with me to the wonderful world of statistics .
And I will take Kenya as an example .
Here you see the data .
What is the origin of the data ?
What we rely on is not an incomplete system .
We have interviews , we have surveys .
How many children did you have ?
Are they alive ?
If they died , at what age and what year ?
But they have good quality .
So this is a limitation .
And when the experts in the U.N.
It was so tragic .
I was so happy .
This was the estimate of the new survey .
Isn &apos;t it nice -- isn &apos;t it nice , yeah ?
So we celebrated .
They start &#91; in &#93; 1990 -- they measure to 2009 .
They say , &quot; 0.9 percent , no progress . &quot;
That &apos;s unfair .
They have 2.4 percent .
We have a decent trend .
The HIV epidemic peaked .
We got , later , the mosquito netting .
So is this fair now to measure this over 19 years ?
An economist would never do that .
I have just divided it into two periods .
In the 90s , only 1.2 percent , only 1.2 percent .
And look here when I take you into my bubble graphs .
Still here , child death per 1,000 on that axis .
Here we have &#91; the &#93; year .
But then , in the &apos; 80s , watch out here .
Congo got into civil war , and they leveled off here .
Ghana got very ahead , fast .
That &apos;s where we are today .
So let me show the wider picture .
My country , Sweden : 1800 , we were up there .
It &apos;s very strange . It &apos;s sort of embarrassing .
And then , you see , these were famine years .
My ancestors moved to the United States .
Sweden achieved a low child mortality because we started early .
We had primary school actually started in 1842 .
So we are off track -- that &apos;s what Sweden is .
But you don &apos;t talk about it so much .
Egypt was up here in 1960 , higher than Congo .
And down they went , you know .
And they got safer water , they eradicated malaria .
And isn &apos;t it a success story .
Millennium Development Goal rates for child mortality is fully possible .
Kenya is now speeding up .
Here we have a problem .
The relationship between child mortality and family size .
This is , once again , 1960 -- 50 years ago .
The dark blue here is sub-Saharan Africa .
And the size of the bubble is the population .
And these are the so-called &quot; developing &quot; countries .
And the ones over there , they were so-called Western countries .
They had low child mortality and small families .
What has happened ?
This is what happened . Now I start the world .
And here Brazil is in the Western Box .
Welcome to a decent life .
Come on . We want everyone down there .
This is the vision we have , isn &apos;t it .
There we are today .
Huh ?
They have here Singapore .
They have the lowest child mortality in the world , Singapore .
They have here Qatar .
It &apos;s the richest country in the world with Al Jazeera .
How the heck could they be &#91; a &#93; developing country ?
This is crap .
The rest here is good -- the rest is good .
What is the importance now with the relations here .
It &apos;s very clear that this is what happens .
Let &apos;s be clear about that .
And that is fully possible . Let &apos;s do it .
Thank you very much .
Drew Curtis : How I beat a patent troll
So case closed , right ?
Wrong .
And this can take quite a while .
And they started settling out .
with no employees .
My response : &quot; How about nothing ? ! &quot;
We didn &apos;t have high hopes for that outcome .
But they settled .
No counter offer .
Now how did that happen ?
It came back signed .
Now why ? You can call them .
They &apos;re not under NDA either .
Patents are very difficult to overturn .
Infringement is a lot easier to disprove .
Don &apos;t forget that .
So what does all this mean ?
And what do they do with that money ?
They plow it right back into filing more troll lawsuits .
The health care industry would like stronger protections for inventors .
The hi-tech industry would like stronger protections for producers .
And I thought , &quot; I should patent this . &quot;
Thank you .
Clay Shirky : Why SOPA is a bad idea
I &apos;m going to start here .
And it &apos;s a copyright violation .
So there &apos;s two bills in Congress right now .
One is called SOPA , the other is called PIPA .
SOPA stands for the Stop Online Piracy Act .
It &apos;s from the Senate .
They want to take them out of the domain name system .
But technology moved on , as technology is wont to do .
Because it turned out we &apos;re not really couch potatoes .
We don &apos;t really like to only consume .
That was the level of rhetoric .
And Congress did something .
Taping and remixing and sharing with your friends is okay .
But this taping business , fine , let it go .
But that wasn &apos;t what the media businesses wanted .
They had wanted Congress to outlaw copying full-stop .
So they went for plan B.
It took them a while to formulate plan B.
Bits are copyable . That &apos;s what computers do .
That is a side effect of their ordinary operation .
Some of the stuff we share is stuff we &apos;ve made .
Some of the stuff we share is stuff we &apos;ve found .
So PIPA and SOPA are round two .
So this is the Internet they have in mind .
These industries will not be content with breaking our Internet .
If they break it , they will break it for everybody .
That &apos;s the easy thing .
That &apos;s the simple thing .
And what they want is not to have to do that .
They don &apos;t want legal distinctions between legal and illegal sharing .
They just want the sharing to go away .
That &apos;s the way to handle this .
Because that &apos;s the real message of PIPA and SOPA .
Thank you .
Jonathan Drori : What we think we know
I &apos;d like to begin with four questions .
That &apos;s an in-joke , by the way .
Would you be able to do that ?
And if you can , just scribble a pattern .
I &apos;m not quite sure how he died , actually .
Was he beheaded in the end , or hung ?
But , actually , we don &apos;t do that .
The mass of this comes out of the air .
Now , I passed all my biology exams in Britain .
That &apos;s what plants actually do for a living .
So , why is it hotter in summer than in winter ?
I promise you that most of you will have got that .
Other ones are kind of going like this . All right .
Right ? That would explain it , right ?
And this is NASA &apos;s view . They &apos;re stunningly similar .
I hope you notice the coincidence here .
You &apos;d show them something like this , wouldn &apos;t you ?
It &apos;s a plan , looking down from above .
But , no , look what I found in the textbooks .
And the Exploratorium does that really , really well .
So , children are not empty vessels , OK ?
Poor teaching actually does more harm than good .
I &apos;ve always wanted to say that in this country .
Thank you very much .
Vilayanur Ramachandran : The neurons that shaped civilization
Just think about this problem for a second .
But it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space .
And this is truly the most amazing thing in the world .
We &apos;re looking at neurons here .
There are 100 billion neurons in the adult human brain .
So , how do you go about studying the brain ?
This is what I spoke about in the last TED .
These neurons will fire when a person performs a specific action .
And this is truly astonishing .
Now , what is the significance of these mirror neurons ?
So , this is important for imitation and emulation .
Well , why is that important ?
Well , let &apos;s take a look at the next slide .
Mirror neurons and imitation , emulation .
All of that happened relatively quickly .
So , this made evolution suddenly Lamarckian , instead of Darwinian .
So , it &apos;s empathizing the other person being touched .
So , I call them Gandhi neurons , or empathy neurons .
And this is not in some abstract metaphorical sense .
You &apos;ve dissolved the barrier between you and other human beings .
And this is not mumbo-jumbo philosophy .
It emerges from our understanding of basic neuroscience .
So , here you have my last slide .
Fahad Al-Attiya : A country with no water
Salaam alaikum .
Welcome to Doha .
I am in charge of making this country &apos;s food secure .
So going in , what was Qatar in the 1940s ?
We were about 11,000 people living here .
None of the glamour that you see today existed .
It wasn &apos;t that they couldn &apos;t develop cities .
Resources weren &apos;t there to develop them .
And you can see that life expectancy was also short .
Most people died around the age of 50 .
So let &apos;s move to chapter two : the oil era .
1939 , that &apos;s when they discovered oil .
What did it do ?
Because we lived scattered .
People started to get to know each other .
And we realized that there are some differences in accents .
So that is the chapter two : the oil era .
Let &apos;s look at today .
So what &apos;s the population today ?
It &apos;s 1.7 million people .
That is in less than 60 years .
Lifespan has increased to 78 .
Water consumption has increased to 430 liters .
And this is amongst the highest worldwide .
Cities were totally wiped out because of the lack of water .
This is history being made in this region .
But of course , with the use of technology .
So Brazil has 1,782 millimeters per year of precipitation of rain .
Qatar has 74 , and we have that growth rate .
The question is how .
How could we survive that ?
We have no water whatsoever .
Simply because of this gigantic , mammoth machine called desalination .
Energy is the key factor here . It changed everything .
So that is our lake , if you can see it .
That is our river .
That is how you all happen to use and enjoy water .
So what are the risks ?
Do you worry much ?
There is growing demand , growing population .
We &apos;ve turned seven billion only a few months ago .
And so that number also demands food .
There &apos;s also changing diets .
They start eating more meat and so on and so forth .
We only have two days of water reserve .
So we also face risks .
The question is , is there a solution ?
Is there a sustainable solution ?
Indeed there is .
Let &apos;s start with the water .
A depletable energy ? Fossil fuel ?
Or should we use something else ?
And that is a lot of water .
Without it we can &apos;t do anything .
So that &apos;s what we are planning to do .
Thank you very much .
Bill Clinton : My wish : Rebuilding Rwanda
It is also unstable .
All easier said than done .
And even non-democratic governments are more sensitive to public opinion .
30 percent of our households gave .
Half of them gave over the Internet .
The median contribution was somewhere around 57 dollars .
And thirdly , because of the rise of non-governmental organizations .
There are now a couple of hundred thousand .
He &apos;s over there .
But the price went to 140 dollars from 500 .
And pretty soon , the average price was 192 dollars .
Now we can get it for about 100 dollars .
We negotiated it down to 190 .
We just reorganized the markets .
I think it &apos;s a bird &apos;s nest on the ground .
We need a movie on those six categories .
So we &apos;re trying to do that .
So organizing these markets is one thing we try to do .
But the money is there to reach others .
The systems are not there to reach the people .
Will it provide high quality care ?
And they &apos;ve achieved a lot of other amazing health results .
And so we have set about doing that .
Now , we started working together 18 months ago .
And then we have others working in these other related programs .
So she now works full-time on this for very little pay .
Mortality at birth was over two-and-a-half percent .
That &apos;s lower than the figure in the United States .
That &apos;s about 43 percent of all the pregnancies .
We &apos;re also beginning to do this in Malawi and Lesotho .
We &apos;re doing this in an environmentally responsible way .
It &apos;s worth a try and I believe it would succeed .
Thank you and God bless you .
Chade-Meng Tan : Everyday compassion at Google
So what does the happiest man in the world look like ?
He certainly doesn &apos;t look like me .
He looks like this .
His name is Matthieu Ricard .
And Matthieu &apos;s happiness measure is off the charts .
He &apos;s by far the happiest man ever measured by science .
Perhaps something very naughty .
Actually , he was meditating on compassion .
Matthieu &apos;s brain scan shows that compassion is not a chore .
Compassion is something that creates happiness .
Compassion is fun .
And that mind-blowing insight changes the entire game .
But fun is not enough .
What if compassion is also profitable ?
What if compassion is also good for business ?
That would create the conditions for world peace .
Fortunately , I didn &apos;t have to look very far .
Google is a company born of idealism .
It &apos;s a company that thrives on idealism .
It &apos;s sort of a funny pattern .
And sometimes it gets big enough to become official .
And let me give you some examples .
So what do they do ?
They just go ahead and start a fundraiser .
And expressions of compassion are also found in our international offices .
But again , fun is not enough .
There are also real business benefits .
So what are they ?
What does that mean ?
There are three components of compassion .
So what has this got to do with business leadership ?
And he calls them &quot; Level 5 leaders . &quot;
These are leaders who are highly ambitious for the greater good .
The motivational component of compassion creates ambition for greater good .
And this is the first compelling business benefit .
Employees mutually inspire each other towards greater good .
So this mutual inspiration promotes collaboration , initiative and creativity .
It makes us a highly effective company .
In our experience , there are three ingredients .
Or , how can you further serve the greater good ?
That &apos;s one .
The second ingredient is autonomy .
So in Google , there &apos;s a lot of autonomy .
And he considers himself one of the inmates .
It &apos;s less naughty than it sounds .
What a company .
So &quot; Search Inside Yourself &quot; -- how does it work ?
It works in three steps .
The first step is attention training .
Attention is the basis of all higher cognitive and emotional abilities .
And this creates the foundation for emotion intelligence .
The second step follows the first step .
The second step is developing self-knowledge and self-mastery .
What does that mean ?
What does that mean ? Imagine this .
I want you to be happy . &quot;
Imagine you can do that .
And this also creates the conditions for compassion in the workplace .
If you want to be happy , practice compassion . &quot;
Thank you .
Stephen Lawler : Tour Microsoft &apos;s Virtual Earth
What does this all mean for us ?
But we want to use our brain !
We want to navigate , explore , discover information .
Here is an example of our aerial camera .
This is panchromatic . It &apos;s actually four color cones .
In addition , it &apos;s multi-spectral .
We fly these airplanes at 5,000 feet in the air .
We think a lot of good can come from this technology .
We have to bundle adjust them . Find tie points .
Extract geometry from the images .
This process is a very calculated process .
In fact , it was always done manual .
They &apos;d drive the streets with lasers called LIDAR .
We think about the user interface .
What does it mean to look at it from multiple perspectives ?
The freshness , the capacity . I can turn this image .
I can look at it from multiple viewpoints and angles .
What we &apos;re trying to do is build a virtual world .
I thank you very much for your time .
Allan Jones : A map of the brain
Humans have long held a fascination for the human brain .
So let &apos;s take a look at the brain .
This is the blood vessels .
On the side here , this is temporal cortex .
This is where all your decision-making processes are going on .
But there &apos;s actually a lot of structure there .
It &apos;s cells and it &apos;s wires all wired together .
And that &apos;s shown here in the the very light blue .
You can see areas where neuronal cell bodies are being stained .
So the outer part of that brain is the neocortex .
It &apos;s one continuous processing unit , if you will .
But you can also see things underneath there as well .
They &apos;re probably less cell dense .
So there &apos;s about 86 billion neurons in our brain .
And as you can see , they &apos;re very non-uniformly distributed .
And how they &apos;re distributed really contributes to their underlying function .
So let &apos;s take a deeper look .
Let &apos;s look at neurons .
So as I mentioned , there are 86 billion neurons .
There are also these smaller cells as you &apos;ll see .
These are support cells -- astrocytes glia .
And the nerves themselves are the ones who are receiving input .
They &apos;re storing it , they &apos;re processing it .
And each neuron itself is largely unique .
These are proteins .
They &apos;re proteins that are controlling things like ion channel movement .
They &apos;re controlling who nervous system cells partner up with .
We each have 23 pairs of chromosomes .
We get one from mom , one from dad .
And on these chromosomes are roughly 25,000 genes .
They &apos;re encoded in the DNA .
So we sent our lab technician out .
We were seeking normal human brains .
What we actually start with is a medical examiner &apos;s office .
This a place where the dead are brought in .
We are seeking normal human brains .
This is magnetic resonance imaging -- MRI .
So we collect this MR.
This maps the large cabling in the brain .
And then what we get is our first mapping .
And remember , it &apos;s frozen .
We take a microscope slide .
Then we very carefully melt onto the slide .
So again this is what they can see under the microscope .
And they can make basically what &apos;s a reference atlas .
This is a more detailed map .
So the technician takes the instructions .
They scribe along a place there .
And then the laser actually cuts .
There &apos;s a container underneath that &apos;s collecting that tissue .
We &apos;re taking over a thousand samples for each brain .
This area shown here is an area called the hippocampus .
It &apos;s involved in learning and memory .
And it contributes to about 70 samples of those thousand samples .
We &apos;ve done right now two human brains-worth of data .
So here &apos;s the modalities that we put together .
Here &apos;s the MR. It provides the framework .
And each gene gives us a fingerprint .
So what can scientists learn about this data ?
We &apos;re just starting to look at this data ourselves .
There &apos;s some basic things that you would want to understand .
Two great examples are drugs , Prozac and Wellbutrin .
These are commonly prescribed antidepressants .
Now remember , we &apos;re assaying genes .
Genes send the instructions to make proteins .
Proteins are targets for drugs .
And for the first time , we can actually do that .
So now we can look throughout the brain .
We can see this unique fingerprint .
And we get confirmation .
It &apos;s as interesting a side effect as it could be .
We &apos;re similar at the genetic level .
And those genes are interesting , but they &apos;re very subtle .
Now what do those differences look like ?
These are two genes that we found as good examples .
DISC1 is a gene that &apos;s deleted in schizophrenia .
Those kinds of studies require much larger populations .
I think these resources are incredibly valuable .
They give researchers a handle on where to go .
We &apos;re certainly going to be looking at more .
This is the new frontier , if you will .
Thanks .
Rose George : Inside the secret shipping industry
It chose Somali piracy .
And I thought , would that happen in any other industry ?
Would we see 544 Greyhound bus drivers ?
It wouldn &apos;t happen .
So I started to get intrigued .
That is how fundamentally we still depend on shipping .
But shipping isn &apos;t that .
Shipping is as crucial to us as it has ever been .
Shipping brings us 90 percent of world trade .
Shipping has quadrupled in size since 1970 .
We are more dependent on it now than ever .
&#91; $ 60.2 billion &#93; Now why is this ?
Nothing to see , move along .
And it was a revelation .
Now that &apos;s because shipping is very efficient .
Containerization has made it very efficient .
Ships have automation now .
They can operate with small crews .
They don &apos;t have time to relax .
So that was a normal working ship .
Now how is that possible ?
And that was a surprise to me .
We were no longer allowed on deck .
There were double pirate watches .
What else does our sea blindness mask ?
And shipping is the greenest method of transport .
There are interesting initiatives going on .
But why has it taken so long ?
A humpback can transmit a sound across a whole ocean .
But there are no laws governing acoustic pollution yet .
I &apos;d really loved being on board Kendal .
Thank you .
Charity Tillemann-Dick : Singing after a double lung transplant
Crazy , I know . Insane .
Thank you .
My heart was three-and-a-half sizes too big .
I was very limited by my condition , physically .
This meant making trade-offs .
I come from Colorado .
Well , the altitude exacerbated my symptoms .
Mine was 146 .
If you run out of medicine , you definitely die .
No one wants to go on Flolan .
But when I needed it , it was a godsend .
Within a few days , I could walk again .
Then in February of 2008 , my grandfather passed away .
It certainly didn &apos;t prepare me for what came next .
Seven weeks later , I got a call from my family .
At 24 , my death would have been entirely expected .
I heard my heart &apos;s valves snapping open and closed .
I didn &apos;t .
I wanted to live .
He said , &quot; Be happy .
A happy patient is a healthy patient . &quot;
And it was right-heart failure .
It was my doctor in Cleveland , Marie Budev .
And they had lungs .
It was a match .
They were from Texas .
And everybody was really happy for me , but me .
I fell into this apocalyptic dream world .
They left my chest open for two weeks .
You could see my over-sized heart beating inside of it .
I was on a dozen machines that were keeping me alive .
An infection ravaged my skin .
He said it would kill me .
One year ago to this very day , I woke up .
I was 95 lbs .
It &apos;s about living .
Medical conditions don &apos;t negate the human condition .
And I &apos;m so grateful they did .
And some of us might even sing .
&#91; Singing : French &#93; Thank you .
Thank you .
And I &apos;d like to thank my pianist , Monica Lee .
Thank you so much .
Thank you .
And I say believe because this process is still ongoing .
In case you &apos;re wondering , this is our strength test .
We have already gone far beyond the limits of human endurance .
From the entrance , this is nothing like a commercial cave .
We &apos;re roughly two days from the entrance at that point .
Otherwise it is completely dark in these places .
It &apos;s basically like a tree collecting water coming down .
So descend into Huautla Plateau in Mexico .
Next year I &apos;ll be leading an international team to J2 .
The lead crews will be underground for pushing 30 days straight .
Now I remember that term really well for two reasons .
This is some life-support equipment closed-cycle .
To experience it is a privilege .
Bill Stone : That was taken in Wakulla Springs , Florida .
This is Europa .
Carolyn Porco mentioned another one called Enceladus the other day .
Now we have to get through the ice .
You need a melt probe .
It &apos;s basically a nuclear-heated torpedo .
The ice could be anywhere from three to 16 miles deep .
You need an AUV , an autonomous underwater vehicle .
And as the movie says , this is one smart puppy .
This is part of DEPTHX &apos;s mission .
There are two primary targets we &apos;re doing here .
One is , how do you do science autonomy underground ?
No hands at the wheel .
DEPTHX is an all-seeing eyeball .
What then of manned space exploration ?
There are three underpinnings of working in space privately .
One of them is the requirement for economical earth-to-space transport .
Go , go , go .
The next thing we need are places to stay on orbit .
It &apos;s not going to look like that .
Anybody drink one of these here this week ?
You &apos;d pay 10,000 dollars for that in orbit .
Not even the guys at Tesla can fight that physics .
There is a place where you can .
We can &apos;t do that right now .
We have to beat that .
We can do it because in space there are no aerodynamics .
We can go and use inflatable systems for almost everything .
And we can extend that now to just about everything .
Bob Bigelow currently has a test article in the orbit .
We can go much further .
There &apos;s another thing .
You got two choices .
It has never been done .
That &apos;s not true .
To bust the paradigm a radically different approach is needed .
I intend to lead that expedition .
It can be done in seven years with the right backing .
We have collectively forgotten that lesson .
Thank you .
Allison Hunt : How to get hip
No , you can &apos;t start the three minutes .
Reset the three minutes , that &apos;s just not fair .
AH : Oh my God , it &apos;s harsh up here .
I mean I &apos;m nervous enough as it is .
Five weeks ago I had total hip replacement surgery .
Do you know that surgery ?
But first you need to know two things about me .
Just two things .
Now , in Canada , we have that great healthcare system .
That means we get our new hips for free .
So my hip had been hurting me for years .
I finally went to the doctor , which was free .
And she referred me to an orthopedic surgeon , also free .
That is what free gets you .
18 more months .
I wouldn &apos;t have my new hip for this TED .
I wouldn &apos;t have my new hip for TEDGlobal in Africa .
I would not have my new hip for TED2008 .
Oh yeah .
Can I tell you how un-Canadian that is ?
We do not think that way .
&quot; Great ! Excellent ! &quot;
No , no . Front of the line .
And I saw a sign .
Well , they signed me up immediately .
Yeah . They needed some young blood .
I worked alone .
Every Friday morning I was at the gift shop .
All the staff got to know the plucky , young volunteer .
So , naturally , I had my vest and my identification .
Two reasons .
Derek Sivers : Weird , or just different ?
This is 26th , that &apos;s 27th . &quot;
You say , &quot; Well , blocks don &apos;t have names .
He leaves , a little confused and disappointed .
Blocks have names .
There &apos;s Block 17 , house number one . &quot;
The second house ever built is house number two .
And this map is also accurate .
Domo arigato gozaimashita .
Nina Tandon : Caring for engineered tissue
Good morning everybody .
We plate them into dishes that we sometimes call petri dishes .
Why do I do this ?
What does that even mean ?
Well , the heart beats , rhythmically , tirelessly , faithfully .
What else do we know about the heart ?
Well , heart cells are pretty greedy .
Let &apos;s take the example of electrical stimulation .
It &apos;s about the size of a mini marshmallow .
And after one week , it &apos;s beating .
You can see it in the upper left-hand corner .
It &apos;s amazing that these cells beat at all .
What does this mean for us ?
Let &apos;s do something really simple .
Let &apos;s remind ourselves that cells are not an abstract concept .
May none of your non-cancer cells become endangered species .
Thank you .
Matt Mills : Image recognition that triggers augmented reality
So let me start with this .
Voice : Now simmer blinks on flowery braes ...
There &apos;s nothing done to this image .
So what I have here is a wireless router .
Then connect the power . Finally , the yellow ethernet cable .
Congratulations . You have now completed setup .
MM : Awesome . Thank you .
They &apos;re not very animated .
This was the fourth take , I &apos;m told .
Tamara , would you like to jump in ?
MM : I should leap in .
Teacher : See what happens . Keep going .
TV .
Oh my God .
Teacher : Now move it either side . See what happens .
Move away from it and come back to it .
Oh , that is so cool .
Teacher : And then , have you got it again ?
Oh my God ! How did you do that ?
Second child : It &apos;s magic .
MM : So , it &apos;s not magic .
Tamara , are you recording ?
Okay , so are you all ready ?
One , two , three . Go !
Audience : Whooooooo !
MM : Fellows are really good at that .
We &apos;re all very , very familiar with the Internet .
It &apos;s completely free to download this application .
Oh , there we are . We can save it now .
Tamara Roukaerts : We &apos;re ready to go .
MM on One , two , three . Go !
Paul Gilding : The Earth is full
Here they are : The Earth is full .
What this means is our economy is unsustainable .
What I &apos;m saying is our approach is simply unsustainable .
But that &apos;s not possible , you might think .
We can &apos;t stop economic growth .
Because that &apos;s what will stop : economic growth .
It will stop because of the end of trade resources .
Come on , you &apos;re thinking .
That &apos;s not possible .
Technology is amazing . People are innovative .
We can surely sort this out .
That &apos;s all true .
Well , it &apos;s mostly true .
The problem is we &apos;re just warming up this growth engine .
China plans to be there in just 20 years .
We need it to develop technology .
We need it to keep social stability .
It &apos;s like the Earth doesn &apos;t care what we need .
And these are not esoteric limits .
It certainly is .
And that &apos;s what will happen to us .
If it &apos;s that bad , we &apos;ll react .
Let &apos;s just think through that idea .
Now we &apos;ve had 50 years of warnings .
We &apos;ve had science proving the urgency of change .
We &apos;re not even slowing down .
I actually don &apos;t say this in despair .
I &apos;ve done my grieving about the loss .
I accept where we are .
It is sad , but it is what it is .
So when does this transition begin ?
When does this breakdown begin ?
In my view , it is well underway .
I know most people don &apos;t see it that way .
I want to talk to you about fear .
The crisis is now inevitable .
This issue is , how will we react ?
Of course , we can &apos;t know what will happen .
The future is inherently uncertain .
Perhaps denial .
Perhaps anger .
Maybe fear .
You can &apos;t see the danger at your door .
Think about war .
And the good news , this one &apos;s a monster .
There &apos;s certainly no technical or economic barrier in the way .
We can do it with proven technology .
We can do it at an affordable cost .
We can do it with existing political structures .
And this is where you come in .
But fear can be paralyzing or motivating .
We need to act like the future depends on it .
We need to act like we only have one planet .
We can do this .
They &apos;re wrong .
We can be more , we can be much more .
The Earth can support that if we choose the right path .
We can choose life over fear .
This could be our finest hour .
Thank you .
Markus Fischer : A robot that flies like a bird
It is a dream of mankind to fly like a bird .
Birds are very agile .
So we bring a team together .
So be careful later on .
So why do we do all this ?
Thank you .
So we can now look at the SmartBird .
So here is one without a skin .
We have a wingspan of about two meters .
And it is all out of carbon fiber .
And if we now beat up and down ...
we have the possibility to fly like a bird .
We have to turn it , go up and go down .
We have a split wing .
Also , we see how we measure the aerodynamic efficiency .
Thank you .
Markus , I think that we should fly it once more .
Markus Fischer : Yeah , sure .
Geoffrey West : The surprising math of cities and corporations
Cities are the crucible of civilization .
That &apos;s where all these problems come from .
Here &apos;s some numbers .
It &apos;s now more than 82 percent .
The planet has crossed the halfway mark a few years ago .
China &apos;s building 300 new cities in the next 20 years .
This is going to affect everything .
So we have this kind of dual nature .
Now these are my comrades in arms .
That &apos;s the question .
That &apos;s the quest .
Is that conceivable ?
Are there universal laws ?
The first is : Are cities part of biology ?
Is London a great big whale ?
Is Edinburgh a horse ?
Is Microsoft a great big anthill ?
What do we learn from that ?
Very few cities fail .
All companies die , all companies .
So is that just another version of this ?
Well we understand this very well .
And the idea is can we do the same for this ?
We &apos;re going to discuss that in a moment more .
That &apos;s called growth .
Here &apos;s how you grew .
Rat , that &apos;s a rat -- could have been you .
We &apos;re all pretty much the same .
And you see , you &apos;re very familiar with this .
You grow very quickly and then you stop .
This is just the weight versus the age .
And you see , it stops growing .
This is what we believe .
Okay , so how do we understand this ?
So let &apos;s first talk about biology .
Something else is going on .
And here &apos;s the point of that .
There is an extraordinary regularity .
And the reason for this is because of networks .
And you &apos;re very familiar with these networks .
That &apos;s a little thing that lives inside an elephant .
And here &apos;s the summary of what I &apos;m saying .
Don &apos;t know . We will discuss that .
Here &apos;s just a symbolic picture of that .
And here &apos;s scaling of cities .
There is a scaling .
The slope of that is less than linear .
There is an economy of scale .
But here &apos;s what &apos;s surprising .
It scales in the same way everywhere .
And what you see is a scaling phenomenon .
And here , they &apos;re all plotted together .
And you can see , they all follow the same line .
And here &apos;s the statement .
What is the reason for this ?
Something universal is going on .
And it is our interactions and the clustering of those interactions .
So there it is , I &apos;ve said it again .
The bigger you are , life gets faster .
On the left is the heart rate showing biology .
Lastly , I want to talk about growth .
This is what we had in biology , just to repeat .
Economies of scale gave rise to this sigmoidal behavior .
You grow fast and then stop -- part of our resilience .
That would be bad for economies and cities .
We have to accelerate on a continuous basis .
See companies , they scale .
It &apos;s the same plot .
We could use sales , anything you like .
And I &apos;m only showing you a little bit of this .
There &apos;s Walmart . Doesn &apos;t look very sigmoidal .
That &apos;s what we like , hockey sticks .
Let &apos;s go up to 2008 .
That red line is from the theory .
And then this is repeated across the entire spectrum of companies .
There they are . That &apos;s 23,000 companies .
Thank you .
David Bismark : E-voting without fraud
Our democracies rely on elections .
Without that mandate , they would be corrupt .
The ballot boxes go to counting places .
So we have to trust a lot of people .
We have to trust a lot of procedures .
And sometimes we even have to trust computers .
They &apos;ve zoomed out and looked at the big picture .
And the big picture is this : elections should be verifiable .
And that &apos;s the tough part .
And the secret is the ballot form .
So this is how you vote .
And you shred the candidate list .
So you let a poll station worker scan your encrypted vote .
So you take this encrypted vote home as your receipt .
No hacker can break in and find out how you voted .
But the election magic doesn &apos;t stop there .
They can check that all the votes were counted correctly .
And these are elections by the people , for the people .
Thank you .
Grégoire Courtine : The paralyzed rat that walked
I still remember this decisive moment .
These words , they stuck with me .
But how to make it happen ?
My idea : We awaken this network .
He listened to me carefully , and responded with a grin .
&quot; Why don &apos;t you try ? &quot;
Imagine that the locomotor system is a car .
The engine is the spinal cord .
The transmission is interrupted . The engine is turned off .
How could we re-engage the engine ?
Immediately , the paralyzed rat can stand .
This was amazing .
This locomotion was completely involuntary .
The animal had virtually no control over the legs .
Clearly , the steering system was missing .
Imagine , this is really cool .
We were so frustrated .
In fact -- Thank you .
But the remaining question was , how ?
I mean , how is it possible ?
And here , what we found was completely unexpected .
But the remodeling was not restricted to the lesion area .
And there is a very important message hidden behind this discovery .
This is truly a trans-disciplinary team .
And me ?
I am only the maestro who orchestrated this beautiful symphony .
Me too , every day .
The truth is that we don &apos;t know enough yet .
Imagine a person just suffered a spinal cord injury .
Thank you .
Alain de Botton : A kinder , gentler philosophy of success
There is a real problem with snobbery .
Because sometimes people from outside the U.K.
The bad news is that &apos;s not true .
Snobbery is a global phenomenon .
We are a global organization . This is a global phenomenon .
It exists . What is a snob ?
That is snobbery .
The dominant kind of snobbery that exists nowadays is job snobbery .
Now , the opposite of a snob is your mother .
But unfortunately , most people are not our mothers .
I don &apos;t think we are particularly materialistic .
And that &apos;s a new way of looking at luxury goods .
In other words -- feel sympathy , rather than contempt .
We &apos;ve done away with the caste system .
And it &apos;s a beautiful idea .
There are no strictly defined kind of hierarchies .
Even though she is much richer than any of you are .
And she &apos;s got a very large house .
She &apos;s simply too strange .
She comes from an odd place .
And yet , they &apos;re not .
But the point is , it doesn &apos;t feel that way .
And the consequences of this problem make themselves felt in bookshops .
In other words , what is a meritocratic society ?
And that makes failure seem much more crushing .
They own their success . But they also own their failure .
Let &apos;s take meritocracy .
I am a meritocrat in that sense .
It &apos;s not the post that should count .
But something very valuable in that idea , nevertheless .
You don &apos;t necessarily know what someone &apos;s true value is .
That is an unknown part of them .
And we shouldn &apos;t behave as though it is known .
There is another source of solace and comfort for all this .
And then are fit for ridicule .
Now is there any alternative to this ?
I gave them the plotline of Madame Bovary .
Again , a book they were enchanted to discover .
And then my favorite .
It would be insane to call Hamlet a loser .
He is not a loser , though he has lost .
We think very highly of ourselves , and so we should .
And so we tend to worship ourselves .
Our heroes are human heroes .
That &apos;s a very new situation .
Here &apos;s an insight that I &apos;ve had about success .
You can &apos;t be successful at everything .
We hear a lot of talk about work-life balance .
Psychoanalysis has been drumming home this message for about 80 years .
We are highly open to suggestion .
So I &apos;m going to end it there .
But let &apos;s accept the strangeness of some of our ideas .
Let &apos;s probe away at our notions of success .
Thank you very much .
Because otherwise it can get quite claustrophobic .
Or do you think that you can &apos;t ?
And your ideal dad is somebody who is tough but gentle .
And it &apos;s a very hard line to make .
Alain de Botton .
Thank you very much .
David Pogue : 10 top time-saving tech tips
I &apos;ve noticed something interesting about society and culture .
That &apos;s true in everything risky except technology .
You &apos;re supposed to learn this stuff how ?
Do that only if you &apos;re paid by the hour .
Instead , hit the space bar .
The space bar scrolls down one page .
Hold down the Shift key to scroll back up again .
So space bar to scroll down one page .
It works in every browser on every kind of computer .
You make the text larger with each tap .
Just hit the space bar twice .
Go space , space . It is totally amazing .
Here &apos;s something that drives me crazy .
I &apos;m not bitter .
Answering machine : At the tone , please — BEEP .
I didn &apos;t say these were going to be perfect .
You don &apos;t even have to click anything .
There &apos;s the definition as you type .
It &apos;s also a complete FAA database .
Type the name of the airline and the flight .
It &apos;s also a unit and currency conversion .
It neatly selects just that word .
Also , don &apos;t delete what you &apos;ve highlighted .
Much more precise . Again , don &apos;t bother deleting .
Just type over it .
It &apos;s extremely frustrating on any camera under 1,000 dollars .
You get it every time .
In the meantime , congratulations .
You all get your California technology license .
Have a great day .
Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala : Want to help Africa ? Do business here
And sometimes I &apos;m puzzled , and I ask myself why .
This is the Africa of opportunity .
Alamieyeseigha was arraigned in London .
That is that people talk about corruption , corruption .
I want to tell you that .
So we decided to privatize many of our enterprises .
Having a telephone in my country was a huge luxury .
You couldn &apos;t get it . You had to bribe .
You had to do everything to get your phone .
So the market is there .
So privatization is one of the things we &apos;ve done .
When they crashed , we crashed .
And that shores up our economy , makes it stable .
We brought inflation down from 28 percent to about 11 percent .
Agriculture grew at better than eight percent .
We have opportunities in agriculture , like I said .
We have opportunities in housing and real estate .
Barclays Bank of the U.K. is bringing in 500 million .
Standard Chartered has brought in 140 million .
We are doing the same with the insurance sector .
So in financial services , a great deal of opportunity .
In tourism , in many African countries , a great opportunity .
This is better than the performance of many OECD countries .
So it &apos;s clear that things are changing .
And I want to just make one point about this investment .
Otherwise , I would have liked you to have seen this .
It says , &quot; Africa : Open for Business . &quot;
For 10,000 pieces .
Nobody thinks there &apos;s opportunity .
So I invite you to explore the opportunities .
Thank you very much .
Bobby Ghosh : Why global jihad is losing
Do you hate Americans ?
What is your connection to Osama bin Laden ? &quot;
What does that mean for us in the West ?
They use his rhetoric .
They even use the brand name he created for his jihad .
They &apos;re fighting battles over much narrower issues .
But that doesn &apos;t mean that we can relax .
It &apos;s old school al Qaeda .
You may remember these guys .
But they have been distracted recently .
When those Mujahideen defeated the Soviet Union , we disengaged .
The good news is that it doesn &apos;t have to be .
We know how to fight it now .
Who ended the global jihad ?
There lie the answers to the solution to local jihad .
He probably thought 9 / 11 was his greatest achievement .
9 / 11 didn &apos;t empower him ; it doomed him .
Who killed bin Ladenism ? Abu Musab al-Zarqawi killed it .
Who killed Osama bin Laden ? The SEAL Team Six .
We don &apos;t have to reinvent the wheel .
We don &apos;t have to go back to that .
We &apos;ve got plenty of these things .
Bin Laden is dead . Bin Ladenism has been defeated .
His definition of jihad can now be expunged .
Thank you .
Kenichi Ebina : My magic moves
Martin Villeneuve : How I made an impossible film
&quot; Mars et Avril &quot; is a science fiction film .
It &apos;s set in Montreal some 50 years in the future .
But in fact I had 10 percent of that budget .
I did &quot; Mars et Avril &quot; for only 2.3 million .
So you might wonder , what &apos;s the deal here ?
How did I do this ?
The second aspect is love .
I got tons and tons of generosity from everyone involved .
But let me go back in time a bit .
And I just love this guy .
His career I admire a lot .
Because this guy is the busiest man on the planet .
But that &apos;s kind of a big problem .
I welded the breech , but the valve is still gaping .
They are objects of desire .
They are imaginary musical instruments .
And they carry a nice story with them .
So that &apos;s kind of a big problem too .
How do you get something that you can &apos;t afford ?
He took a leap of faith .
So here they are .
Why ? Because I offered him a space to dream .
I have experienced it .
Thank you .
Paul Collier : New rules for rebuilding a broken nation
The record on post-conflict recovery is not very impressive .
Why has the record been so poor ?
The first principle is : it &apos;s the politics that matters .
So , the first thing that is prioritized is politics .
Try and build a political settlement first .
So , short-term peacekeepers .
And thirdly , what is the exit strategy for the peacekeepers ?
It &apos;s an election .
That will produce a legitimate and accountable government .
So that &apos;s the conventional approach .
I think that approach denies reality .
We see that there is no quick fix .
There &apos;s certainly no quick security fix .
And the risks stay high throughout the decade .
And they stay high regardless of the political innovations .
Does an election produce an accountable and legitimate government ?
What an election produces is a winner and a loser .
And the loser is unreconciled .
The reality is that we need to reverse the sequence .
Why does the politics get easier ?
And why is it so difficult initially ?
And that doesn &apos;t produce a productive politics .
So that is what you get when you face reality .
But the objective of facing reality is to change reality .
The first actor is the Security Council .
It is a cost-effective approach .
It does increase security .
But it needs to be done long-term .
That &apos;s one actor , the Security Council .
The donors provide post-conflict aid .
They moved on to some other situation .
Post-conflict economic recovery is a slow process .
There are no quick processes in economics except decline .
You can do that quite fast .
And then the third key actor is the post-conflict government .
And there are two key things it &apos;s got to do .
It &apos;s got to reform economic policy .
Why ? Because during conflict economic policy typically deteriorates .
So this legacy of conflict is really bad economic policy .
The inclusion agenda doesn &apos;t come from elections .
Elections produce a loser , who is then excluded .
So the inclusion agenda means genuinely bringing people inside the tent .
So those three actors .
And they are interdependent over a long term .
And so we need a post-conflict compact .
So that &apos;s idea one : recognize interdependence .
And that is to focus on a few critical objectives .
One is jobs .
So jobs , health , and clean government .
Those are the three critical priorities .
Jobs .
What is a distinctive approach to generating jobs in post-conflict situations ?
And why are jobs so important ?
Jobs for whom ? Especially jobs for young men .
It &apos;s because young men get upset .
Now , that is difficult .
That is not a good idea .
It &apos;s not sustainable .
These are not environments where you can build export manufacturing .
But typically that sector has withered away during conflict .
During conflict people are doing destruction .
What might the bottlenecks be ?
First you need access to land .
We need firms . The firms have gone away .
So we need to encourage the growth of local firms .
Neither of those approaches is sensible .
One advantage of that is that you can allocate money coherently .
Another is , you can make NGOs accountable .
They want to have the discipline and accountability .
So that &apos;s a way to get basic services scaled up .
So , jobs , basic services , finally , clean government .
Clean means follow their money .
And so inadvertently we empower the people who are the problem .
What &apos;s the goal ?
If we follow this , what would we hope to achieve ?
So that &apos;s the focus on the construction sector .
Where would that leave us ?
George Whitesides : Toward a science of simplicity
The trouble is , I don &apos;t .
The quote is from the fabled Potter Stewart opinion on pornography .
But I know it when I see it . &quot;
I &apos;m going to come back to that in a moment .
So , what is simplicity ?
It &apos;s good to start with some examples .
Why is that important ?
Well , it enables you to drink coffee .
And the two here are just examples .
One is the cellphone , which we use every day .
The teapot problem I &apos;ll pose this way .
And that &apos;s a simple question .
It &apos;s like , what is simplicity ?
All of these are possibilities .
What is the state of science ?
And , interestingly , complexity is very highly evolved .
We have a lot of interesting information about what complexity is .
We academics -- I am an academic -- we love complexity .
You &apos;re not interested in the limits of these things .
It is a system , like traffic , which has components .
The components interact with one another .
These are cars and drivers . They dissipate energy .
And it &apos;s like the traffic that you see .
Anyone who tells you that we understand life , walk away .
And let me reduce this to the simplest level .
We &apos;ve heard from Bill Gates recently .
Terrific . You learn everything you can about that .
That &apos;s a Bono , this is a Bono .
The answer is , not a lot .
And that &apos;s complexity .
The Internet starts with mathematics , it starts with binary .
In binary , one is 0001 , seven is 0111 .
The question is : Why is binary simpler than Arabic ?
Anything else is more complicated .
They can be on and off . That &apos;s binary .
Now wall switches , we all know , fail .
A transistor is nothing more than a wall switch .
With integrated circuits , you can build cellphones .
And from that comes the Internet .
And this is a map of bitflows across the continent .
And then back to simplicity again .
Their behavior is predictable .
So simplicity and predictability are characteristics of simple things .
So , for example , stones .
That is , you can stack them .
It just is not possible .
So these are the components .
So , how does one do that ?
It &apos;s a little paper chip .
It wicks its way up into these little branches .
You know , no power required .
So you can &apos;t make it too simple .
This is by de Saint-Exupery .
And that certainly is going in the right direction .
Thank you very much .
Quick question .
Have you started to do that ?
GW : Well , no .
How do I put that simply ? No .
That was a simple , powerful answer . GW : Yes .
You &apos;ve got a company set up to ...
GW : A foundation , a foundation . Not-for-profit .
Rachel Botsman : The case for collaborative consumption
Now I &apos;m going to start with a deceptively simple example .
Now my husband , Chris , and I love this show .
So what &apos;s happening here ?
Namely , that technology is enabling trust between strangers .
I call this &quot; groundswell collaborative consumption . &quot;
It &apos;s second nature to them .
So all of this is a lot of twittering , right ?
Three , pressing unresolved environmental concerns .
The first is redistribution markets .
The second is collaborative lifestyles .
One of my favorite examples of collaborative lifestyles is called Landshare .
It &apos;s a scheme in the U.K.
Together they grow their own food .
Now , the third system is product-service systems .
This idea is particularly powerful for things that have high-idling capacity .
It &apos;s kind of ridiculous , right ?
Because what you need is the hole , not the drill .
I &apos;m not asking people to share nicely in the sandpit .
The average car costs 8,000 dollars a year to run .
Yet , that car sits idle for 23 hours a day .
They could only use their Zipcar membership when absolutely necessary .
The results of this challenge after just one month was staggering .
Now products-service systems have been around for years .
Just think of libraries and laundrettes .
This represents an eight-year time span .
But now with the Web , we leave a trail .
Let &apos;s go back to my first example , Swaptree .
In other words , I can trust him or her .
And this reputation capital will determine our access to collaborative consumption .
I &apos;m on a mission to make sharing cool .
I &apos;m on a mission to make sharing hip .
Thank you very much .
Malcolm London : &quot; High School Training Ground &quot;
Teachers paid less than what it costs them to be here .
This is a training ground .
My high school is Chicago , diverse and segregated on purpose .
Social lines are barbed wire .
Labels like &quot; Regulars &quot; and &quot; Honors &quot; resonate .
The need for degrees has left so many people frozen .
Omar Ahmad : Political change with pen and paper
You actually put action to the issues you care about .
So , how do you do that ?
You can send them an email .
It doesn &apos;t matter , it &apos;s spam .
How about you get on the phone ?
That doesn &apos;t move .
So what actually works ?
And the answer is rather strange .
It &apos;s a letter .
Letters actually work .
So , how are you going to write your letter ?
And it is critical that you actually handwrite your letter .
They don &apos;t spend a lot of time dicking around .
So , here you go .
Ad hominem attacks will get you nowhere .
&quot; Obviously , you &apos;re intelligent .
Lastly , you want to be the nurturing agent .
You &apos;re the safe place to come in to .
Why is is this important ?
Here &apos;s how you mail your letter .
So , you send the copy to the main office .
Get writing .
Damian Palin : Mining minerals from seawater
I collaborate with bacteria .
And this attracts metals from their local environment .
And the desalination process is one where we take out salts .
We can use it for drinking and agriculture .
So seawater reverse osmosis is a membrane-filtration technology .
We take the water from the sea and we apply pressure .
And this pressure forces the seawater through a membrane .
This takes energy , producing clean water .
But this will produce an equally massive amount of desalination brine .
And this is where my collaboration with bacteria comes into play .
Thank you .
Drew Dudley : Everyday leadership
We &apos;ve made into something beyond us .
We &apos;ve made it about changing the world .
&quot; It was awesome .
This girl right here knows exactly what I &apos;m talking about .
He just kind of held the lollipop out like this . &quot;
And she walks away , and I &apos;m flattened .
I &apos;m still dating that guy four years later . &quot;
Here &apos;s the kicker . I don &apos;t remember that .
Our greatest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure .
Shane Koyczan : To This Day ... for the bullied and beautiful
There &apos;s so many of you .
But that &apos;s what we were told .
Stand up for yourself .
Geek . Fatty . Slut . Fag .
I always thought that was an unfair question .
It presupposes that we can &apos;t be what we already are .
We were kids .
When I was a kid , I wanted to shave .
Now , not so much .
When I was 11 , I wanted to be left alone .
And they said , &quot; Choose something realistic . &quot;
So I said , &quot; Professional wrestler . &quot;
And they said , &quot; Don &apos;t be stupid . &quot;
And I wasn &apos;t the only one .
Granted , my dreams are shy , because they &apos;re Canadian .
My dreams are self-conscious and overly apologetic .
See , my dreams got called names too .
Silly . Foolish . Impossible .
But I kept dreaming .
I was going to be The Garbage Man .
My finishing move was going to be The Trash Compactor .
I was crushed , as if by a trash compactor .
Poetry .
Standing up for yourself doesn &apos;t have to mean embracing violence .
This is who I am .
This is how I stand up for myself .
I thought they were both pork chops .
Not really a big deal .
I saw no reason to lie .
As far as I was concerned , life was pretty good .
To this day , I hate pork chops .
But the school halls were a battleground .
We found ourselves outnumbered day after wretched day .
We weren &apos;t the only kids who grew up this way .
To this day , kids are still being called names .
It was practice , and yes , some of us fell .
You signed it , &quot; They were wrong . &quot;
Maybe they decided to pick you last for basketball or everything .
You have to believe that they were wrong .
They have to be wrong .
Why else would we still be here ?
We only got out to walk and get gas .
Of course they did .
Raffaello D &apos;Andrea : The astounding athletic power of quadcopters
So what does it mean for a machine to be athletic ?
Quads have been around for a long time .
So , how did it just do that ?
The bulk of our research is algorithms .
It &apos;s the magic that brings these machines to life .
We use something broadly called model-based design .
We first captured the dynamics with a set of differential equations .
Let me demonstrate the strength of this approach .
How did we design the algorithms to do this ?
It naturally doesn &apos;t spill no matter what the quad does .
In this instance , carrying a glass of water is easy .
Balancing a pole is hard .
Can a machine also perform with extreme physical damage ?
Or do they ?
Mathematical models tell us exactly when and why this is possible .
Will the diver be able to pull off a rip entry ?
Will the vaulter stick the landing ?
There simply isn &apos;t enough time .
Striking a moving ball is a necessary skill in many sports .
We first figure out where the ball is going .
These three quads are cooperatively carrying a sky net .
Notice that , at full extension , these quads are vertical .
Take this quad , for example .
It &apos;s trying to stay at a fixed point in space .
We can change this behavior , however .
We now have an intimate way of interacting with a machine .
Let &apos;s have a little bit of fun with this .
Okay , here goes .
Whew !
Let me introduce you to the wizards behind the green curtain .
Look out for them . They &apos;re destined for great things .
Thank you .
Thomas Goetz : It &apos;s time to redesign medical data
Because we are all patients , we are all people .
Even doctors are patients at some point .
It goes all the way back to Aristotle .
And doctors hate it , right ?
I mean , they complain about it all the time .
We talk about it in terms of engagement , or non-compliance .
Not a lot of cool , sexy stuff happening in dentistry .
People brush and floss their teeth .
They had a big patient population .
They divided them up into two groups .
So that was the low-fear group .
The high-fear group , they laid it on really thick .
They showed bloody gums .
They showed puss oozing out from between their teeth .
They told them that their teeth were going to fall out .
You &apos;ll eat mush for the rest of your life .
So go brush and floss your teeth .
That was the message . That was the experiment .
Now they measured one other variable .
So the upshot was this .
So fear showed up as not really the driver .
It was the sense of efficacy .
It &apos;s an amazing notion .
Except , maybe we do .
This is a campaign from the American Diabetes Association .
This is still the way we &apos;re communicating messages about health .
And I don &apos;t know if it works .
Now here &apos;s what does work : personalized information works .
Again , Bandura recognized this years ago , decades ago .
So let me just spool it out a little bit .
But it actually hits home .
It &apos;s a difficult and expensive commodity , until now .
And here &apos;s how they work in the feedback loop .
The choice in this case is pretty simple .
We either keep going fast , or we slow down .
They reduce speeds by about five to 10 percent .
But it works , and it even has some health repercussions .
Your blood pressure might drop a little bit .
It &apos;s very difficult to line things up so neatly .
But we have an opportunity .
This is a pharmaceutical ad .
But it looks completely right .
Because we know .
Who among us would actually say that people read this ?
This is a bankrupt effort at communicating health information .
There is no good faith in this .
So this is a different approach .
So let me just walk through this quickly .
You can understand exactly what the benefits are .
And finally , you understand what those choices are .
So I love this . I love that drug facts box .
And so I came up with this : lab test results .
Blood test results are this great source of information .
They &apos;re packed with information .
They go right to doctors .
This is the worst presented information .
So that &apos;s what I want to walk you through .
This is our one-page summary .
We use the notion of color .
It &apos;s an amazing notion that color could be used .
We tell you that you &apos;re okay , you &apos;re normal .
So that &apos;s our general blood work test .
Then we went to CRP test .
In this case , it &apos;s a sin of omission .
What you &apos;re actually measuring is spelled out in clean language .
The last one I &apos;ll show you is a PSA test .
Here &apos;s the before , and here &apos;s the after .
We again personalized the risks .
And then again , the follow-up actions .
That &apos;s what Wired magazine spent on this .
Why is Wired magazine doing this ?
It should be the patient .
This is information that is incredibly powerful .
It &apos;s an incredibly powerful catalyst to change .
It &apos;s being lost .
But you can create your own feedback loop .
And the only acceptable answer is -- -- yes .
And then , what &apos;s next ?
This is not beyond the grasp of ordinary people .
That &apos;s what engagement is . It &apos;s different from compliance .
And this information is out there .
Thank you very much .
Kate Orff : Reviving New York &apos;s rivers -- with oysters !
But one thing is clear .
So the era of big infrastructure is over .
We need new tools and new approaches .
So we need new stories , new heroes and new tools .
Another set of views of actually the Gowanus Canal itself .
Now the Gowanus is particularly smelly -- I will admit it .
So we really had a lot to deal with .
And the idea has two core stages .
Here we are , back to our hero , the oyster .
And again , it &apos;s this incredibly exciting animal .
They were key in our culture and our economy .
They really become nature &apos;s wave attenuators .
And they become the bedrock of any harbor ecosystem .
Many , many species depend on them .
What is fuzzy rope , you ask ?
So get your Tevas on .
So you can imagine scuba diving here .
So the water is churned through this raft .
So rather than having 10 oysters , you have 10,000 oysters .
And then those spat are then seeded .
New word .
And also showing oyster gardening for the community along its edges .
I get asked two questions about this project .
One is : why isn &apos;t it happening now ?
And the answer is : not yet , they &apos;re working .
Thank you .
Stephen Cave : The 4 stories we tell ourselves about death
What did it mean that he was dead ?
Where had he gone ?
Could that hole in reality open up and swallow me ?
Our idea of death develops as we grow older .
And this development in childhood reflects the development of our species .
This is , if you like , our curse .
It &apos;s the price we pay for being so damn clever .
We each live in the shadow of a personal apocalypse .
And that &apos;s frightening . It &apos;s terrifying .
And so we look for a way out .
Now this didn &apos;t sound very plausible .
Now we can see this as the biggest bias of all .
It has been demonstrated in over 400 empirical studies .
Now these studies are ingenious , but they &apos;re simple .
They work like this .
Now , one group was asked to think about being dead .
The other group was asked to think about being lonely .
They were then asked again about their religious beliefs .
Twice as likely .
Even though the before they were all equally agnostic .
Now , the first story is the simplest .
Ancient Egypt had such myths , ancient Babylon , ancient India .
In other words , I can do what Jesus did .
All you need is an Internet connection and a funny cat .
I want to live on in my apartment . &quot;
Well the Greek philosopher Epicurus thought we could .
And so it should be with us .
Thank you .
Richard Resnick : Welcome to the genomic revolution
Ladies and gentlemen , I present to you the human genome .
Chromosome one , top left .
Bottom right are the sex chromosomes .
How many are there in the human genome ? Three billion .
Is that a big number ?
Well , everybody can throw around big numbers .
So it &apos;s really quite big .
That was all done on a machine that looks like this .
It &apos;s called the Beijing Genomics Institute .
What does this mean for medicine ?
So a woman is age 37 .
She presents with stage 2 estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer .
She is treated with surgery , chemotherapy and radiation .
She goes home .
Unfortunately , treated again with surgery and chemotherapy .
Six months later , she comes back with acute myeloid leukemia .
She goes into respiratory failure and dies eight days later .
What they had was dopa-responsive dystonia .
Significant problems remained .
And so what he did was he got his kids sequenced .
Guys , this would never have happened without whole genome sequencing .
That &apos;s how fast this is moving .
So here &apos;s little Nick -- likes Batman and squirt guns .
But the gene that regulates that down is broken .
Today , it &apos;s here .
None , not one .
And then more general versions of word processors came about .
Look , this is where we are today .
So I just recently had to buy life insurance .
But what would have happened if I had said C ?
Consumer applications for genomics , they will flourish .
Personalized genomic massage anyone ?
And it looks really good .
Do you think that &apos;s not going to happen ?
Do you think it would have helped John McCain ?
Anybody ? Nobody .
Typically , there &apos;s one or two .
So my father &apos;s father was one of 10 Resnick brothers .
They all hated each other .
And they all moved to different parts of the planet .
Now this is probably a good thing , right ?
You have bigger clan gatherings and so on .
But maybe it &apos;s a bad thing as well .
How many fathers in the room ? Raise your hands .
Thank you .
Alain de Botton : Atheism 2.0
Now I think it &apos;s too easy .
Now what is Atheism 2.0 ?
I can &apos;t believe in the doctrines .
I don &apos;t think these doctrines are right .
I really like the art of Mantegna .
I really like looking at old churches .
I really like turning the pages of the Old Testament . &quot;
Until now , these people have faced a rather unpleasant choice .
So that &apos;s a sort of tough choice .
I don &apos;t think we have to make that choice .
I think there is an alternative .
The secular world is full of holes .
We have secularized badly , I would argue .
I &apos;d like to kick off by looking at education .
Now education is a field the secular world really believes in .
That &apos;s a lovely idea .
Interesting where it came from .
They asked themselves the following question .
And influential voices came up with one answer .
They said culture .
They wanted to replace scripture with culture .
And that &apos;s a very plausible idea .
It &apos;s also an idea that we have forgotten .
Why ? They don &apos;t think we need it .
They see us as adults , rational adults .
What we need is information .
We need data , we don &apos;t need help .
Now religions start from a very different place indeed .
We &apos;re only just holding it together .
Perhaps this is just me , maybe you .
But anyway , we &apos;re only just holding it together .
And we need help . Of course , we need help .
And so we need guidance and we need didactic learning .
Now we &apos;ve given up with the idea of sermons .
I &apos;m an independent , individual person . &quot;
Religions go , &quot; Nonsense .
You need to keep repeating the lesson 10 times a day .
So get on your knees and repeat it . &quot;
Otherwise our minds are like sieves .
So religions are cultures of repetition .
They circle the great truths again and again and again .
We associate repetition with boredom .
&quot; Give us the new , &quot; we &apos;re always saying .
&quot; The new is better than the old . &quot;
Not so if you &apos;re adopting a religious mindset .
The other things that religions do is to arrange time .
All the major religions give us calendars .
What is a calendar ?
Now we don &apos;t think that way .
I &apos;ll just come across it . &quot;
Nonsense , says the religious world view .
It sets things into perspective , etc . , etc .
You &apos;ll be handed rice cakes .
That &apos;s very good .
But the religious world doesn &apos;t think that way .
And we &apos;d know that we had a real rhythm going .
So for example , take the Jewish idea of forgiveness .
They don &apos;t just deliver us sermons on this .
They don &apos;t just give us books or words about this .
They tell us to have a bath .
We don &apos;t tend to do that .
Let &apos;s look at art now .
A lot of our surplus wealth goes to museums , etc .
You &apos;ve heard that saying .
I couldn &apos;t disagree more .
But that feeling of puzzlement is structural to contemporary art .
Now religions have a much saner attitude to art .
They have no trouble telling us what art is about .
Art is about two things in all the major faiths .
And that &apos;s what art is .
Essentially it &apos;s propaganda .
Rembrandt is a propagandist in the Christian view .
Now the word &quot; propaganda &quot; sets off alarm bells .
Propaganda is a manner of being didactic in honor of something .
All works of art are talking to us about things .
Art should be didactic .
Let &apos;s think of something else .
And they tend to be on their own .
And they get depressed and they get sad on their own .
And they don &apos;t really change much .
Now think about religions , think about organized religions .
What do organized religions do ?
They group together , they form institutions .
And that has all sorts of advantages .
First of all , scale , might .
These are massive machines .
These are all very good qualities .
We recognize them in relation to corporations .
They &apos;re selling us shoes and cars .
We need to group together .
And that &apos;s what religions do .
That &apos;s something we can learn from .
I want to conclude .
Look very closely at pilgrimage .
Thank you very much .
You can get shot by both sides .
Incoming missiles from North Oxford at any moment .
Indeed .
Is there any room for that experience in Atheism 2.0 ?
Actually , let me just ask a question .
One wants to say , &quot; Nonsense . Why not ? &quot;
And that &apos;s really the spirit of my talk .
There &apos;s so much we can absorb .
No , we need to be polite about differences .
Politeness is a much-overlooked virtue .
It &apos;s seen as hypocrisy .
You move on .
They &apos;ve ignored the possibility of harmonious disagreement .
It doesn &apos;t need it .
I &apos;ve sketched a sort of broad framework .
So it &apos;s a wiki project .
Alain , thank you for sparking many conversations later .
I &apos;m a gamer , so I like to have goals .
I like special missions and secret objectives .
Okay , some of you are looking a little bit skeptical .
And it won &apos;t make a lot of sense now .
Now , you have a secret mission too .
Now , I want to take this problem seriously .
So I have been thinking about this question a lot lately .
Number one : I wish I hadn &apos;t worked so hard .
Number three : I wish I had let myself be happier .
For example , I wish I hadn &apos;t worked so hard .
I wish I &apos;d stayed in touch with my friends .
I wish I &apos;d let myself be happier .
And we &apos;re going to come back to this one .
Really wanting to die .
Now let me tell you that story .
So I had to avoid everything that triggered my symptoms .
It said , you &apos;re never going to get better .
It said , the pain will never end .
Now , why a game ?
This was an easier way to ask for help .
We also collected and activated power-ups .
Now what happened next with the game surprised me .
Even people were playing it for terminal diagnoses like ALS .
They talked about feeling stronger and braver .
They talked about feeling better understood by their friends and family .
Well , it turns out there &apos;s some science here too .
Some people get stronger and happier after a traumatic event .
And that &apos;s what was happening to us .
We usually hear about post-traumatic stress disorder .
I feel closer to my friends and family .
I &apos;m better able to focus on my goals and dreams .
Now , does this sound familiar ?
Now this is interesting , right ?
But how does it work ?
How do you get from trauma to growth ?
That would be good , right ?
So here &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
We &apos;re going to play a quick game together .
Very good .
That &apos;s all it takes .
Everybody ready for your next quest ?
Go !
Don &apos;t give up .
Bonus physical resilience . Well done , everyone .
It gets stronger the more you exercise it .
So good job . Quest number three .
If you &apos;re outside , find a window and look in .
So , what do we want to see ?
Baby dolphin and baby llamas . Everybody look .
Got that ?
Okay , one more . Baby elephant .
We &apos;re clapping for that ?
That &apos;s amazing .
And here &apos;s a secret from the scientific literature for you .
And this is called the three-to-one positive emotion ratio .
It &apos;s my favorite SuperBetter trick , so keep it up .
Looking good , looking good .
Nice , nice .
Keep it up . I love it !
Now , a great way to boost social resilience is gratitude .
Touch is even better .
So this is true .
Yeah ! Awesome .
Wait , wait , wait .
You still have your special mission , your secret mission .
Well , here &apos;s my suggestion .
Pretty clever , right ?
Thank you .
Caroline Phillips : Hurdy-gurdy for beginners
And in Spanish , &quot; zanfona . &quot;
And in Italian , &quot; ghironda , &quot; okay ?
Hurdy-gurdy , or wheel fiddle .
It has three different kinds of strings .
And the third string is pretty innovative .
Luckily , all of this changed a couple of centuries later .
It &apos;s made by specialized luthiers , also in Europe .
And it &apos;s very difficult to tune .
So without further ado , would you like to hear it ?
CP : Okay .
There I go .
&#91; Basque &#93; Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
Lauren Zalaznick : The conscience of television
So most everyone watches TV .
We like it . We like some parts of it .
Here in America , people actually love TV .
The average American watches TV for almost 5 hours a day .
Okay ?
But a lot of people don &apos;t love it so much .
They , in fact , berate it .
They call it stupid , and worse , believe me .
We &apos;re talking about popular TV .
We have the capacity to laugh and cry .
We feel awe , we feel pity .
That is separate and apart from the animal kingdom .
We love to watch TV .
This is something that clearly separates us from the animal kingdom .
Why has television entertainment evolved the way it has ?
How did you feel watching every single one of these shows ?
Did you feel a sense of moral ambiguity ?
Did you feel outrage ? Did you laugh ?
What did this mean for you ?
So I really hope our global audiences can relate .
Okay , here we go .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re watching TV for .
Moral ambiguity starts to climb .
Why ?
Look what happens .
In 1970 , inspiration plummets .
Moral ambiguity takes off .
It &apos;s trying to recover .
Take a look at this .
This chart is going to document a very similar trend .
This is rising . Comfort stays whole .
Irreverence starts to rise .
Social commentary is all of a sudden spiking up .
You get to 1969 , and look what happens .
What &apos;s number one ?
They &apos;re all living together , right .
Viewers had responded dramatically .
Look at this green spike in 1966 to a bellwether show .
That &apos;s what we mean by a breakout show .
In 1970 , the dam bursts . The dam bursts .
Comfort is no longer why we watch television .
Social commentary and irreverence rise throughout the 70s .
Now look at this .
The 70s means who ? Norman Lear .
It can make me feel this ?
It can change us ?
What were those shows ?
Glamorous and rich .
&quot; Dallas , &quot; &quot; Fantasy Island . &quot;
Everything &apos;s good , low unemployment .
But look : X marks the spot .
Why not ?
We had a 2000 presidential election decided by the Supreme Court .
We had the bursting of the tech bubble .
We had 9 / 11 .
Anthrax becomes part of the social lexicon .
Look what happens when we keep going .
What do people want in their TV then ?
I would have thought revenge or nostalgia .
Give me some comfort ; my world is falling apart .
No , they want judgment .
I can vote you off the island .
I can keep Sarah Palin &apos;s daughter dancing .
I can choose the next American Idol . You &apos;re fired .
That &apos;s all great , right ?
We &apos;re animals , we need our moms .
This era &apos;s mom , Bree Van de Kamp .
So thanks very much .
Ze Frank : Nerdcore comedy
It &apos;s such a large conference .
I invented the Placebo Camera .
Sincerely , Mister Michael Bangoora . &quot;
This is really embarrassing .
I was told backstage that I have 18 minutes .
I only prepared 15 .
I &apos;m really sorry .
What &apos;s your name ?
Are you a virgin ? Virgin ?
You don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about ?
Ah , Mark -- Serfaas .
1,860 -- am I good ?
And that &apos;s nothing to be ashamed of .
That &apos;s nothing to be ashamed of .
Really cool , we were getting wasted .
Am I feeling lucky ?
Am I feeling lucky ?
Audience : Yes .
Ze Frank : Oh . Amazing .
Needless to say , I was able to leave my job .
And , finally , you know , become freelance .
I -- I knew I had something .
It &apos;s like a microscope to the rest of the world .
For example , somebody wrote me .
And that was embarrassing .
I hear a lot of you whispering .
You can do heckler mode .
Voice : Hey , moron , get off the stage .
ZF : You get off the stage .
Voice : We want Malcolm Gladwell .
In case you run over time .
And frog mode .
I came up with a few games .
This is called &quot; Atheist . &quot;
I figured it &apos;d be popular with the young kids .
Look , I &apos;ll move around and say some things .
So that didn &apos;t go over so well .
I don &apos;t really understand why you &apos;re laughing .
Should have done this before I tried to pitch it .
But you come back as a duck .
It &apos;s the third in the series .
I &apos;m hoping it &apos;s going to do well this year .
Do you have a preference ? Good choice .
Over 500 entries in three weeks , toilet paper fashion .
I think they &apos;re wonderful .
In other words , it &apos;s a helping tool .
Darling . Beautiful stuff .
These are haikus .
Oh , this is how you make puppets .
Ladies and gentlemen , Mr. Ze Frank .
Yann Dall &apos;Aglio : Love -- you &apos;re doing it wrong
What is love ?
I can love jogging .
I can love a book , a movie .
I can love escalopes .
I can love my wife .
Think about the young woman who must remain chaste before marriage .
This phenomenon is modernity .
We can basically summarize it through a triple process .
Now it is quoted in the stock exchange .
Hence the anxiety of contemporary man .
He is obsessed : &quot; Am I desirable ? How desirable ?
How many people are going to love me ? &quot;
And how does he respond to this anxiety ?
Well , by hysterically collecting symbols of desirability .
Indeed , our consumer society is largely based on seduction capital .
It is said about this consumption that our age is materialistic .
Consumerism is not materialism .
These teachers call themselves &quot; pick-up artists . &quot;
So they are artists of picking up chicks .
And they call heartache &quot; one-itis . &quot;
One-itis can be translated as &quot; an infection from one . &quot;
We can also envision a romantic use of the genome .
But such a future doesn &apos;t have to be .
Another path to thinking about love may be possible .
But how ?
How to renounce the hysterical need to be valued ?
Well , by becoming aware of my uselessness .
Yes , I &apos;m useless .
But rest assured : so are you .
We are all useless .
I don &apos;t have any inherent value .
What is tenderness ?
To be tender is to accept the loved one &apos;s weaknesses .
It &apos;s not about becoming a sad couple of orderlies .
That &apos;s pretty bad .
It is a sort of poetry of deliberate awkwardness .
I refer to self-mockery .
Bjarke Ingels : 3 warp-speed architecture tales
He triggered the modernist revolution .
At each meeting , there &apos;s way too many ideas .
Only the best ones can survive .
We mate them . They have sort of mutant offspring .
As you can see , sometimes a subspecies branches off .
It doesn &apos;t really work in this context .
So as a result , we never throw anything out .
We keep our office almost like an archive of architectural biodiversity .
You never know when you might need it .
And we saw this guy , Haibao .
We even double checked .
So the People &apos;s Building , as we called it .
This is our two interpreters , sort of reading the architecture .
And we had the chance to explain the project .
So we obviously profoundly agreed with him .
Unfortunately , Mr. Chen is now in prison for corruption .
Sustainability .
China symbolized by the dragon .
Denmark , we have a national bird , the swan .
The biggest tourist attraction in China is the Great Wall .
The big tourist attraction in Denmark is The Little Mermaid .
That can actually hardly be seen from the canal tours .
And it sort of shows the difference between these two cities .
Copenhagen , Shanghai , modern , European .
This is how it looks today ; all traffic jam .
Bicycles have become forbidden many places .
Meanwhile , in Copenhagen we &apos;re actually expanding the bicycle lanes .
A third of all the people commute by bike .
We donate 1,000 bikes to Shanghai .
You can try it .
So quite often you load water for ballast .
So we can actually hitch a ride for free .
The first thing , the China map missed Taiwan .
They tried to pass a law against moving the Mermaid .
This is my apartment .
The house is sort of a distortion of a square block .
This is our first architectural model .
This is an aerial photo taken last summer .
And essentially , the apartments cover the parking .
They are accessed through this diagonal elevator .
The wood of your apartment continues outside becoming the facades .
They can actually have both .
Unfortunately , it was the national bank of Iceland .
So we took the commission .
We quite often make little movies .
They create shelter from the wind .
They accumulate the solar energy .
They accumulate the water .
So they actually transform the entire island into a single ecosystem .
Yes , maybe just to round off .
Thank you .
Joseph Lekuton : A parable for Kenya
My name is Joseph , a Member of Parliament in Kenya .
I had never in my life ever tasted candy .
Stayed when everybody else was dropping out .
My family moved ; we &apos;re nomads .
Fifty miles , 40 miles , it doesn &apos;t matter .
You slept in the bush , but you kept going .
And they were left behind , waiting to die .
But these two people worked something out .
We &apos;ll walk you , you lead us . &quot;
So I said , &quot; I &apos;m going to dedicate myself .
And I came for them , and that &apos;s my goal .
We &apos;re building dispensaries across that constituency .
I &apos;m trying to improve infrastructure .
Thank you very much .
Liz Diller : A new museum wing ... in a giant bubble
But we &apos;re less attuned to the nuances of the public .
What translates generic public space into qualitative space ?
And we &apos;re doing this through some case studies .
It really goes beyond distinction .
Now we &apos;re moving onto Washington , D.C.
The Mall is a symbol of American democracy .
It may just be a place for civic commiseration .
And could the museum be an agent of cultural diplomacy ?
There are over 180 embassies in Washington D.C.
There are over 500 think tanks .
There should be some kind of brain trust .
It would have the global reach of the World Economic Forum .
It would have the interdisciplinarity of the TED Conference .
It would have the informality of the town square .
Architects love to hate it .
And around that space , the ring is actually galleries .
Very , very difficult to mount shows in there .
Where would it go ?
It can &apos;t go in the Mall .
There is no space there .
It can &apos;t go in the courtyard .
It &apos;s already taken up by landscape and by sculptures .
Well there &apos;s always the hole .
How could it become iconic ?
And what language would it take ?
The Hirshhorn sits among the Mall &apos;s momumental institutions .
It has to be different from the buildings there .
It has to be something entirely different .
It has to be air .
In our imagination , it has to be light .
It has to be ephemeral . It has to be formless .
And it has to be free .
So this is the big idea .
It &apos;s a giant airbag .
The before and the after .
It was dubbed &quot; the bubble &quot; by the press .
That was the lounge .
The membrane is translucent .
It &apos;s made of silcon-coated glass fiber .
This is the view from the inside .
It had to be approved by actually two agencies .
I blush whenever I show this .
It is yours to interpret .
There was also some creative interpretation involved .
This pretty much exempts monuments of the church and state .
And the bubble is 153 ft .
That &apos;s the Pantheon next to it .
It &apos;s about 1.2 million cubic feet of compressed air .
And so we couldn &apos;t really touch its surfaces .
We couldn &apos;t leave any traces behind .
It glows from within , it &apos;s translucent .
So it &apos;s down the hierarchy on lighting .
So it comes to the site twice a year .
It &apos;s taken off the delivery truck .
It &apos;s hoisted .
And then it &apos;s inflated with this low-pressure air .
And then it &apos;s restrained with the cables .
And then it &apos;s ballasted with water at the very bottom .
And they really connected with that idea .
And then it was really easy all the way through .
But some of the toughest hurdles have been the technical ones .
This is the warp and weft .
This is a point cloud .
There are extreme pressures .
And I &apos;m just going to zip through these slides .
And this is the space in action .
Form and content are together here .
The bubble is an anti-monument .
Thank you .
Tim Ferriss : Smash fear , learn anything
This is Tim Ferriss circa 1979 A.D. Age two .
Obviously , you see the resemblance .
And this routine went on for some time .
When I was seven I went to summer camp .
My parents found it necessary for peace of mind .
You could jump off the end into the deep end .
I was born premature . I was always very small .
My left lung had collapsed when I was born .
And I &apos;ve always had buoyancy problems .
So water was something that scared me to begin with .
But I would go in on occasion .
A camp counselor fortunately came over and separated us .
From that point onward I was terrified of swimming .
That is something that I did not get over .
But there is a happy ending to this story .
And I would like to share my art .
So , moving onward .
Swimming , first principles .
First principles , this is very important .
So the clock started ticking .
I tried kickboards .
Hand paddles , everything .
Even did lessons with Olympians -- nothing helped .
That set me on the road to examining biomechanics .
The first is , forget about kicking . Very counterintuitive .
So it turns out that propulsion isn &apos;t really the problem .
The problem is hydrodynamics .
And you do that by maintaining a horizontal body position .
So let &apos;s look at some examples . This is Terry .
And so his entire body really is underwater .
The arm is extended below the head .
Here is an example of the stroke .
You can see this is the left extension .
Then you see his left leg .
Not their fault , honestly .
And I &apos;ll get to implicit versus explicit in a moment .
And that will get you very far .
Languages . Material versus method .
Six months later I had the chance to go to Japan .
So my parents encouraged me to do it . I left .
I arrived in Tokyo . Amazing .
But I said , &quot; Please rape me at eight a.m. &quot;
You &apos;ve never seen a more confused Japanese woman .
I walked in to school .
Asked him what this said .
And so it came to me in waves .
There had been something lost in translation .
The Japanese classes were not Japanese instruction classes , per se .
And that &apos;s pretty much my response .
I tried everything . I went to Kinokuniya .
I tried every possible book , every possible CD .
Nothing worked until I found this .
And this became my Holy Grail , my Rosetta Stone .
You can also do this with grammar .
I came up with these six sentences after much experimentation .
We can talk about that if anyone in interested .
And now I love languages .
So ballroom dancing , implicit versus explicit -- very important .
I used to be much bigger , much more muscular .
And so I ended up walking like this .
Not very good for ballroom dancing .
The instructor says , &quot; You are participating . &quot;
Immediately : death sweat .
&quot; Okay , come on , grab me . &quot;
Gorgeous assistant instructor .
Everyone burst into laughter . I was humiliated .
So I bought a month &apos;s worth of classes .
So I had a very short deadline for a competition .
I interviewed these people because they all taught in Buenos Aires .
I found that longer steps were much more elegant .
Secondly , different types of pivots .
Thirdly , variation in tempo .
I want you to see part of what I practiced .
I &apos;m going to jump forward here .
His name is Gabriel Misse .
Alicia , in her own right , very famous .
That &apos;s just one benefit of that .
So then we broke it down .
This would be an example of one pivot .
This is a back step pivot .
There are many different types .
So fear is your friend . Fear is an indicator .
Sometimes it shows you what you shouldn &apos;t do .
Especially with fears you gained when you were a child .
Apply them to very big dreams .
I know nothing . I &apos;m a beginner .
Thank you very much .
Bill Gross : A solar energy system that tracks the sun
There was gas rationing in 1973 .
The energy crisis was in full bore .
That got me very excited .
So , I started this company called Solar Devices .
But they didn &apos;t believe me .
And my first year at Caltech , I continued the business .
First , the coursework at Caltech .
So what about making energy ?
Maybe we could make energy .
I tried to figure out -- maybe solar &apos;s become attractive .
So , that &apos;s a breakthrough .
I &apos;ll be very short on genetic algorithms .
And I &apos;ll show you what we came up with .
Traditionally , concentrators look like this .
Those shapes are parabolas .
And this is the shape that evolved .
Solar cells collect light for four and a half hours though .
We needed to beat solar cells .
So we took a look at another idea .
But , his refinements were incredible .
Those were major breakthroughs .
Another type of engine is the hot air engine .
Put a flame under it , the piston moves up .
That &apos;s a heat engine .
We applied the genetic algorithm .
We got the results from that for the optimal engine .
Let me show you what it looks like in real life .
So this is the engine .
The exact converse is also true .
So now you put the two things together .
Thank you .
It doesn &apos;t really care .
and you also get hot water .
The hot water &apos;s optional .
This is how we would envision a residential application .
It &apos;s a really good combination of those two factors .
This is the map of the United States .
And of course , look at Africa .
It just makes economic sense .
Right now , solar paybacks are between 30 and 50 years .
Basically , oil is solar energy concentrate .
Thank you very much , you &apos;ve been a great audience .
Marc Pachter : The art of the interview
And that &apos;s what it &apos;s about .
So , how do we do that ?
Now , I had two preconditions .
One was that they be American .
Sixties , seventies , eighties and nineties .
And why did I do that ?
Well , for one thing , we &apos;re a youth-obsessed culture .
That &apos;s the one advantage that older people have .
There are many kinds of interviews . We know them .
Fair enough .
But I wanted interviews that were different .
By the way , this was always done in public .
This was not an oral history program .
I didn &apos;t know it coming into it .
And he had never appeared in public since that point .
But then I began to think of other things .
Who makes a great interview in this context ?
It was about their energy .
It &apos;s energy that creates extraordinary interviews and extraordinary lives .
I &apos;m convinced of it .
These were people through their 90s .
And I said , &quot; Yeah . Apparently I did . &quot;
The worst interview I ever did : William L. Shirer .
Didn &apos;t matter . &quot; Whatever .
Awful .
I never would ever agree to interview a modest person .
There &apos;s an extraordinary woman named Clare Boothe Luce .
She did so much . She was a playwright .
She did an extraordinary play called &quot; The Women . &quot;
She was a congresswoman when there weren &apos;t very many congresswomen .
So she and I had a delightful conversation .
It was all part of Clare Boothe Luce &apos;s look .
She was in a great evening gown .
And she stonewalled me . It was unbelievable .
When we were alone , I was her audience .
Now I &apos;m her competitor for the audience .
Just withering in her contempt .
And I said , &quot; I &apos;m learning . &quot;
Again , a remarkable person .
And she was in horrible pain .
We all knew that .
She stayed in her room .
Everybody came . The butler passed around canapes .
The usual sort of thing .
Was yours unhappy ? &quot;
And I asked him one question .
I said , &quot; Did Jefferson ever disappoint you ? &quot;
Dumas Malone was from Mississippi originally .
This was to Agnes de Mille .
An amazing woman .
She said , &quot; Come to my apartment . &quot;
She lived in New York .
She wasn &apos;t about to make up for this occasion .
She wasn &apos;t unhappy about this . She was resigned .
She agreed .
She came on . Of course she was wheelchaired on .
Half of her body was stricken , the other half not .
It was an amazing privilege to do this series .
Thank you very much .
Elyn Saks : A tale of mental illness -- from the inside
So I &apos;m a woman with chronic schizophrenia .
I &apos;ve spent hundreds of days in psychiatric hospitals .
For a week or more , I had barely eaten .
My face looked and felt like a mask .
The air was fetid , the room a shambles .
&apos;Thank you for coming , Steve .
Crumbling world , word , voice .
Tell the clocks to stop .
&apos;Gravity is pulling me down .
Fortunately , I did not actually enact that grave prognosis .
Thank you .
He &apos;s definitely the star of my show .
Let &apos;s start with the definition of schizophrenia .
Schizophrenia is a brain disease .
Delusions and hallucinations are hallmarks of the illness .
Imagine having a nightmare while you &apos;re awake .
The schizophrenic mind is not split , but shattered .
This person is likely to have some form of schizophrenia .
&apos;Memos are visitations , &apos; I informed them .
&apos;They make certain points . The point is on your head .
&apos;Come to the Florida sunshine bush .
I shrugged and followed them .
&apos;We &apos;ve got to case the joint .
This episode led to my first hospitalization in America .
I had two earlier in England .
This incident resulted in my involuntary hospitalization .
I never struck anyone .
I never harmed anyone . I never made any direct threats .
There &apos;s nothing benign about it .
They &apos;re different from me and you .
They wouldn &apos;t experience restraints as we would . &quot;
My motto was the less medicine , the less defective .
All around me I sensed evil beings poised with daggers .
The mission is not yet complete .
&apos;Head explosions and people trying to kill .
I think you need to be in the hospital .
You &apos;re offering to put me in hospitals ?
Hospitals are bad , they &apos;re mad , they &apos;re sad .
&quot; &apos; I give life and I take it away .
So let me share some final thoughts .
Also , we must stop criminalizing mental illness .
The poet Rainer Maria Rilke was offered psychoanalysis .
So would I take the pill ? In an instant .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you . You &apos;re very kind .
Thank you .
Liz Coleman : A call to reinvent liberal arts education
The story begins in the late &apos; 90s .
They were trying to figure out how to rebuild their universities .
Expertise has for sure had its moments .
But the price of its dominance is enormous .
We have even managed to make the study of literature arcane .
What kind of a world should we be making ?
What kind of a world can we be making ? &quot;
Meanwhile , the values and voices of democracy are silent .
And that was only the beginning .
We are playing with fire .
So the conversation began at Bennington .
Enhancing the public good becomes a primary objective .
When the design emerged it was surprisingly simple and straightforward .
They would assume the commanding role of traditional disciplines .
Design , the art of organizing the world of things .
But so does the importance of content .
This discovery is transforming .
Ideology , zealotry , unsubstantiated opinions simply won &apos;t do .
This is a political education , to be sure .
But it is a politics of principle , not of partisanship .
So the challenge for Bennington is to do it .
The center will embody and sustain this new educational commitment .
Think of it as a kind of secular church .
The words on the card describe what will happen inside .
So we are doing our job .
We actually do it all the time .
That is where you come in .
President Obama and his team simply cannot do it alone .
So what do you do when you feel overwhelmed ?
Well , you have two things .
You have a mind . And you have other people .
Start with those , and change the world .
Onyx Ashanti : This is beatjazz
Text : BeatJazz .
Accelerometers on each hand read hand position .
The color of the lights indicates which sound I am playing .
a button , two guitar picks and lots of hot glue .
The heads-up display is a smartphone that displays system parameters .
Why ?
And &quot; BeatJazzers &quot; become as common as D.J. &apos; s .
But mostly ...
to MAKE the future rather than wait for it .
Jane Fonda : Life &apos;s third act
Think about that .
That &apos;s the metaphor , the old metaphor .
Age as pathology .
How do we live it successfully ?
What is the appropriate new metaphor for aging ?
Age not at all as pathology ; age as potential .
And guess what ?
This potential is not for the lucky few .
We tend to see commonalities more than differences .
Some of the studies even say we &apos;re happier .
This is not what I expected , trust me .
I come from a long line of depressives .
And I got scared .
I thought , oh my gosh .
I &apos;m going to become a crotchety old lady .
I have such a powerful feeling of well-being .
I don &apos;t want to romanticize aging .
Some of it is a matter of luck .
Some of it , obviously , is genetic .
One third of it , in fact , is genetic .
And there isn &apos;t much we can do about that .
Myself included .
And here &apos;s an example of what I mean .
It &apos;s a terrible disease . It &apos;s fatal .
It wastes the body , but the mind remains intact .
As I slowly lost my speech , I gained my voice .
As I diminished , I grew .
Perhaps our parents suffered from depression .
Perhaps we still suffer from a psychic pain , a wound .
And so we can feel unfinished .
How was I supposed to live it ?
What was I supposed to accomplish in this final act ?
Who were my grandparents ?
How did they treat my parents ?
These kinds of things .
It wasn &apos;t your fault ; you &apos;re just fine .
You &apos;re able to free yourself from your past .
You can work to change your relationship to your past .
It &apos;s like resetting a thermostat .
It helps us become what we might have been .
Women start off whole , don &apos;t we ?
We have agency .
We are the subjects of our own lives .
Older women are the largest demographic in the world .
Thank you very much .
Kartick Satyanarayan : How we rescued the &quot; dancing &quot; bears &quot;
We went about getting evidence of what was going on .
And this is footage from a hidden camera in a button .
And we went in , pretending to be buyers .
Sadly , the family of Qalandars depended on this bear .
The couple are barely 18 years old .
And what they were doing to the bears was really appalling .
It was unacceptable .
The mother bears are usually killed .
The cubs , which are taken , are separated .
Their teeth are basically bashed out with a metal rod .
And we were so unsure that this would work .
He has a telephone booth .
This is Sadua who came and surrendered his bear .
Then there was no looking back at all for us .
We gave cycle rickshaws .
We set up carpet-weaving units , vocational training for the women .
Education . The kids never went to school .
They only had Islamic education , very little of it .
So , we sponsor 600 children education programs today .
We were able to ensure brighter futures for these people .
Of course we also had to get the bears in .
This is what happens to the bears when they come in .
And this is what we turn them into .
We have a veterinary facility in our rescue centers .
So , basically in 2002 there were 1,200 dancing bears .
We rescued over 550 dancing bears .
And the people can hold their heads up high .
And there will be no more removing of these bears .
Marla Spivak : Why bees are disappearing
They &apos;re out there because they need to eat .
Now this business of hand pollination is actually not that uncommon .
Tomato growers often pollinate their tomato flowers with a hand-held vibrator .
Now this one &apos;s the tomato tickler .
I got drawn into the honeybee world completely by a fluke .
I had never thought about insects living in complex societies .
It was like the best of science fiction come true .
And I was permanently hooked .
Now this society has no central authority .
Nobody &apos;s in charge .
So bees have social healthcare .
We &apos;ve found that propolis is a natural disinfectant .
It &apos;s a natural antibiotic .
Humans have known about the power of propolis since biblical times .
So what &apos;s going on ?
We stopped planting cover crops .
Clover and alfalfa are highly nutritious food plants for bees .
And we started growing larger and larger crop monocultures .
And then there &apos;s pesticides .
This small bee is holding up a large mirror .
How much is it going to take to contaminate humans ?
You &apos;ve probably heard about it .
This is a new class of insecticides .
Public enemy number one for bees is this thing .
It &apos;s called varroa destructor .
It &apos;s aptly named .
Let me put this all together for you .
But what if I lived in a food desert ?
And it &apos;s not just our honeybees .
These bees are providing backup for our honeybees .
They &apos;re providing the pollination insurance alongside our honeybees .
We need all of our bees .
So what are we going to do ?
It turns out , it &apos;s hopeful . It &apos;s hopeful .
Plant them in a pot on your doorstep .
Set aside farmland .
And we need to diversify our farms .
On behalf of the bees , thank you .
Thank you . Just a quick question .
What &apos;s your hope / depression level on this ?
Maria Spivak : Yeah .
About 20 years ago , we were at a 15-percent loss .
So it &apos;s getting precarious .
We &apos;re kind of at a tipping point .
We can &apos;t really afford to lose that many more .
Thank you .
Tom Wujec : 3 ways the brain creates meaning
And the consensus was : it really worked .
The processing , of course , begins with the eyes .
We &apos;re only going to talk about three of them .
So the first one is called the ventral stream .
It &apos;s on this side of the brain .
It &apos;s the &quot; what &quot; detector .
A second part of the brain is called the dorsal stream .
You &apos;d be activating the dorsal stream if you did that .
And it &apos;s the part that feels .
It &apos;s the selective logic .
Now we &apos;ve augmented this and spatialized this information .
And so we can compare and contrast the big ideas .
So the act of engaging and creating interactive imagery enriches meaning .
It activates a different part of the brain .
So the point of this is what ?
The lessons for us are three-fold .
So the low-tech version looks like this .
This is a time-lapse view of it .
You &apos;ll be able to figure that out .
No Powerpoint is used in two days .
And this is our great unveiling for today .
So making images meaningful has three components .
The first again , is making ideas clear by visualizing them .
Secondly , making them interactive .
And then thirdly , making them persistent .
Janet Echelman : Taking imagination seriously
This story is about taking imagination seriously .
I was an unlikely person to be doing this .
I never studied sculpture , engineering or architecture .
The deadline for the show arrived -- my paints didn &apos;t .
I had to do something .
This fishing village was famous for sculpture .
So I tried bronze casting .
But to make large forms was too heavy and expensive .
My first satisfying sculpture was made in collaboration with these fishermen .
It &apos;s a self-portrait titled &quot; Wide Hips . &quot;
We hoisted them on poles to photograph .
I was mesmerized .
So we raised this 45,000-pound steel ring .
So we had to create one .
This intersection had been bland and anonymous .
Now it had a sense of place .
I walked underneath it for the first time .
My life was not going to be the same .
Its shape was too complex now .
So we had to create it .
My artistic horizons continue to grow .
I &apos;ll leave you with this story .
I got a call from a friend in Phoenix .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
Shimon Steinberg : Natural pest control ... using bugs !
That &apos;s a magnifier times 10 .
Yeah , times 10 .
Just open it .
So this phenomenon of natural control exists literally everywhere .
Here , in front of this building , I &apos;m sure .
Just have a look at the plants .
What is a pest ?
What damage &#91; does &#93; it actually inflict on the plant ?
Let &apos;s have a look at that .
And then you see what kind of damage it can inflict .
But here comes nature that provides us with a good spider .
By the way , they are hungry always .
And there is another example : aphids .
By the way , it &apos;s springtime now in Israel .
Females giving rise to females giving rise to other females .
No males at all .
Parthenogenesis , &#91; as it &#93; was so called .
And they are very happy with that , apparently .
Here we can see the damage .
And here comes the salvation through this parasitic wasp .
Here we are not talking about a predator .
By the way , the aphid tries to escape .
This is all natural . This is all natural .
This is not fiction , nothing at all .
Again , in your backyard , in your backyard .
But this is the end result .
This is the end result : Mummies -- M-U-M-M-Y .
The birth is almost complete .
And this is of course not the end of it .
But this is a nice , slender , very bad pest .
If you can see this , sweet peppers .
This is not just an exotic , ornamental sweet pepper .
And again , in action .
So this is a very positive situation , by the way .
Everything is just fine under these circumstances .
What we do is actually this .
Many different parts .
There are no GMOs -- Genetically Modified Organisms -- whatsoever .
And that &apos;s what we get , in fact .
You see under a microscope .
And this is the whole bunch of predatory mites .
You see this ampoule . You see this one .
I have one gram of those predatory mites .
So this is what I call amplification of the phenomenon .
And no , we do not disrupt the balance .
That &apos;s the whole idea .
And what is the impact ?
So the impact is very strong .
Why good bugs ?
It &apos;s the same , and it can happen very quickly .
It hardly happens .
And thirdly , public demand .
Because , you see , this is the reality .
Have a look at the gap .
I think it &apos;s times 100 or something like that .
Twenty-five billion .
So there is a huge gap to bridge .
So actually , how can we do it ?
And this gap really narrows .
Step by step , it does narrow .
Thank you .
Carl Safina : The oil spill &apos;s unseen culprits , victims
This is the ocean as I used to know it .
First , just a little bit about me .
It &apos;s like you dipped a marble in water .
Carbon dioxide level has gone up and up and up .
We &apos;re warming the climate .
So this really matters .
And they can handle water .
They can handle a hurricane that comes and goes .
When the water goes down , they know what to do .
They don &apos;t have another thing they can do .
You see a lot of oil on the ocean .
You see a lot of oil on the shoreline .
Parts of the ocean there look just absolutely apocalyptic .
It &apos;s really messy .
They have thousands and thousands of plastic bags .
Meanwhile , there are still people trying to use the beach .
You see people who are really shell-shocked .
They are very hardworking people .
They &apos;re finding that their world is really collapsing .
These are the things that you can see .
What &apos;s going on underwater ?
Well , some people say there are oil plumes .
Some people say there are not oil plumes .
I created a little oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
I think it &apos;s being hidden on purpose .
But you can see it .
Okay .
We heard that bacteria eat oil ?
So do sea turtles .
Turtles eat it . It gets in the gills of fish .
These guys have to swim around through it .
That guide &apos;s entire calendar year is canceled bookings .
He has no bookings left .
Everybody wanted their deposit back . Everybody is fleeing .
That &apos;s the story of thousands of people .
Their numbers have never recovered .
It &apos;s going to take longer for some things .
These tuna swim the entire ocean .
But these are really high-performance athletic animals .
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;ll affect the adults .
And they populate much larger areas .
Down on the lower left there are Ruddy Turnstones and Sanderlings .
The economic effects go at least nationally in many ways .
The biological effects are certainly hemispheric .
Mainly what they &apos;re doing is booms and dispersants .
The booms are absolutely not made for open water .
They get near shore . Look at these two boats .
That one on the right is called Fishing Fool .
The dispersants make the oil go right under the booms .
The booms are only about 13 inches in diameter .
So it &apos;s just absolutely crazy .
Here are shrimp boats employed .
Here they are working .
All they &apos;re doing is stirring it .
It &apos;s just ridiculous .
Everybody &apos;s trying to protect the bird colonies there .
These birds make a living by diving into the water .
It &apos;s really , really important that we express our compassion .
I refuse to acknowledge this as anything like an accident .
I think that this is the result of gross negligence .
Not just B.P.
B.P. operated very sloppily and very recklessly because they could .
Now there are things that we can do in the future .
And you &apos;d have some idea of what to do .
That &apos;s certainly one of the things we need to do .
That &apos;s what it would really mean to be conservative .
I think there are signs of hope .
We seem to be waking up a little bit .
So it &apos;s a continued fight .
It &apos;s a historic moment right now .
The first offshore wells were called whales .
The first offshore drills were called harpoons .
We emptied the ocean of the whales at that time .
Now are we stuck with this ?
Who says it &apos;s too expensive ?
People who sell us fossil fuels .
Energy is always a moral issue .
It &apos;s an issue that is moral right now .
It &apos;s a matter of right and wrong .
Thank you very much .
Martin Jacques : Understanding the rise of China
The world is changing with really remarkable speed .
Goldman Sachs projected 2027 .
The post-crisis projection is 2020 .
That &apos;s just a decade away .
China is going to change the world in two fundamental respects .
This is an illusion .
It will remain in very fundamental respects very different .
How do we try to understand what China is ?
We can &apos;t .
And you can see it against the boundaries of modern China .
It &apos;s never been the case .
And what does it mean ?
Well , I think it has all sorts of profound implications .
I &apos;ll give you two quick ones .
It divided , and it &apos;s remained divided ever since .
The second is maybe more prosaic , which is Hong Kong .
You may remember what the Chinese constitutional proposition was .
One country , two systems .
&quot; Window dressing .
We were wrong . Why were we wrong ?
Think of German unification , 1990 .
What happened ?
Well , basically the East was swallowed by the West .
One nation , one system .
That is the nation-state mentality .
It doesn &apos;t work .
The Chinese don &apos;t feel like that .
China is only multiracial really at the margins .
So the question is , why ?
It &apos;s had no serious rivals .
Know that China believes in the market and the state .
But this is combined with an extremely strong and ubiquitous state .
The state is everywhere in China .
and was finally completed in the seventh century A.D.
It &apos;s kind of arrogant .
And secondly , it &apos;s ignorant .
We refuse to really address the issue of difference .
But it &apos;s not .
I mean , take the question of East Asia .
Now the largest economic region in the world .
And there are two consequences of this .
Europe was not at the final negotiating table .
When did that last happen ?
I would wager it was probably about 200 years ago .
And that is what is going to happen in the future .
Take the 19th century , for example .
But this , alas , is no longer true .
It doesn &apos;t even look like a railway station .
Okay , so how would I like to finish ?
That &apos;s what Europe and North America represented .
I think they &apos;re playing golf .
Christ , the Chinese even invented golf .
Welcome to the future . Thank you .
Philip K. Howard : Four ways to fix a broken legal system
Well , law is also a powerful driver of human behavior .
And our guide was a local science teacher .
The stories started pouring out .
You have to go in a school bus . &quot;
This is a doctor , whose life is caring for people .
People no longer feel free to act on their best judgment .
So , what do we do about it ?
And of course the hindsight bias is perfect .
Absolutely vital .
Is it working ?
What does the macro-data show us ?
It &apos;s very hard to measure because there are mixed motives .
Let &apos;s go to schools .
Well it turns out the schools are literally drowning in law .
And what happens when the teacher tries to assert order ?
They &apos;re threatened with a legal claim .
And how has this system of law worked for government ?
It doesn &apos;t seem to be working very well does it ?
Neither in Sacramento nor in Washington .
That means all the boys are going to be ADD .
I mean it &apos;s just absolutely a formula for failure .
My favorite , though , are all the warning labels .
They &apos;ll think it was some kind of aphrodisiac .
My favorite warning was one on a five-inch fishing lure .
Life is complicated enough without legal fear .
And so the state can come in .
It actually changes the way people think .
Then you &apos;ve wasted 200 billion dollars in unnecessary tests .
Self-consciousness is the enemy of accomplishment .
So , how do you restore trust ?
States with extensive tort reform still suffer all these pathologies .
It turns out that freedom actually has a formal structure .
We &apos;ve forgotten that second part .
So , what &apos;s needed now is to rebuild these boundaries .
And it &apos;s especially important to rebuild them for lawsuits .
So , how do we rebuild it ?
Life is too complex for ...
Life is too complex for a software program .
And so here is the fourth proposition .
The constitution is only 16 pages long .
Worked pretty well for 200 years .
And how do you make it simple ?
We have to rehumanize the law .
That person doesn &apos;t exist today .
This is the hardest hurdle .
Case dismissed without prejudice or refiling in small claims court .
You can &apos;t run a society by the lowest common denominator .
So , what &apos;s needed is a basic shift in philosophy .
We &apos;ve been taught that authority is the enemy of freedom .
Law is a human institution ; responsibility is a human institution .
That &apos;s what &apos;s happened to America . Look around .
Alastair Parvin : Architecture for the people by the people
That &apos;s our kind of working presumption .
And I think it &apos;s wrong , actually .
The economy ran out of jobs .
And a couple of things struck me about this .
One , don &apos;t listen to career advisers .
And a good place to start is your own paycheck .
That &apos;s about 36,000 , 37,000 dollars .
So here &apos;s a story .
They &apos;re far too small . They get congested between classes .
There &apos;s bullying . We can &apos;t control them .
Instead , get rid of the school bell .
And a lot of people can &apos;t even afford them .
How will we sell design services ?
And that &apos;s a good thing .
And that began with open-source software .
And that &apos;s where 3D printing gets really , really interesting .
And they &apos;re distributing massively really complex manufacturing capabilities .
That really is an industrial revolution .
And we were fascinated by what that might mean for architecture .
And it goes together without any bolts .
It uses wedge and peg connections .
They don &apos;t need any traditional construction skills .
Of course , the house is never finished .
One of them is that it &apos;s always incredibly sociable .
People get confused between construction work and having fun .
Don &apos;t reinvent the wheel every time .
They &apos;re self-made cities in one form or another .
A kind of Wikipedia for stuff ?
How much would that change the rules ?
And I think the technology &apos;s on our side .
Thank you very much .
David Keith : A critical look at geoengineering against climate change
The fact is -- uh-uh .
And we &apos;ve accomplished close to zip .
This is the growth rate of CO2 in the atmosphere .
But in fact , they &apos;re growing faster .
I don &apos;t want to depress you too much .
Cheap meaning a few percent of GDP .
Instead , we spend our time talking .
But , of course , the natural world , polar bears .
They will completely lose .
And there &apos;s no adaption .
So this problem is absolutely soluble .
And I know for certain that that will work .
And the reason is , it &apos;s been done .
The result of that was pretty dramatic .
There &apos;s no big mystery about it .
But it clearly cools down .
And one other thing : it &apos;s fast .
So you can &apos;t step on the brakes very quickly .
But if you do this , it &apos;s quick .
And there are times you might like to do something quick .
Another thing you might wonder about is , does it work ?
And the answer seems to be yes .
This topic is also old .
I &apos;m not saying we shouldn &apos;t cut emissions .
We should , but it made exactly this point .
So , in a sense , there &apos;s not much new .
The one new thing is this essay .
He said roughly what &apos;s been said before .
One of the problems with sulfates is they fall out quickly .
I &apos;ll tell you very quickly how the effect works .
And so you see a net force away from the sun .
That &apos;s called the photophoretic force .
I &apos;m sure there will be other problems that arise .
The one thing about this is it gives us extraordinary leverage .
Now , suppose that space aliens arrived .
And the box has two knobs .
One knob is the knob for controlling global temperature .
Maybe another knob is a knob for controlling CO2 concentrations .
You might imagine that we would fight wars over that box .
We have no global governance .
And different people will have different places they want it set .
But we &apos;re building that box .
Even when they &apos;re doing it for other reasons .
They develop science that makes it easier and easier to do .
We need a broader debate .
It &apos;s very cheap . We have a lot of leverage .
And that calculation isn &apos;t much in dispute .
I don &apos;t think anybody takes that seriously .
But here &apos;s a case which is harder to reject .
That &apos;s an absolutely possible scenario .
But there is a problem with that view .
This is what economists call a moral hazard .
Should we do serious research on this topic ?
Should we have a national research program that looks at this ?
A very small amount of money would get us some .
But I have a lot of reservations .
Another thing is , maybe we need a treaty .
A treaty that decides who gets to do this .
And I think it really summarizes where we are here .
Thank you very much .
Nellie McKay : &quot; Clonie &quot;
Dan Dennett : Cute , sexy , sweet , funny
Exactly . Exactly . And it is a strange inversion .
But Darwin shows that it &apos;s just false .
Guys go for girls like this because they are sexy .
We adore babies because they &apos;re so cute .
There &apos;s nothing intrinsically sweet about honey .
Sweetness was born with the wiring which evolved .
And there &apos;s nothing intrinsically sexy about these young ladies .
That &apos;s all there is to it .
It wasn &apos;t designed for chocolate cake .
Chocolate cake is a supernormal stimulus .
It was a hyperstimulus for them , and they loved it .
There &apos;s lots of supernormal stimuli for sexiness .
So nature works on many levels here .
This is the strange inversion .
Thank you very much .
How will we be remembered in 200 years ?
It happened 225 years ago .
It was actually a terrible disaster for Princeton .
It &apos;s the child that &apos;s remembered .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re going through at this time .
That will blow away a lot of the opposition .
So , let &apos;s leave that aside .
And I &apos;m interested in searching for life in the universe .
It &apos;s not only cold , but very dry .
So the asteroids we don &apos;t have much hope for .
And that makes it extraordinarily interesting as a place to explore .
That &apos;s something we don &apos;t yet know how to do .
There are plans to do it , but it &apos;s hard .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to talk about .
What would they need in order to grow on the surface ?
So they would have to have something like a reptilian skin .
And the regular astronomers were scornful about this .
So there &apos;s no point in looking . &quot;
There is something called pit lamping .
You take -- that &apos;s a Canadian expression .
So these creatures will be bright against the cold surroundings .
It &apos;s extremely hard to move from one planet to another .
I call these creatures sunflowers .
They look like , maybe like sunflowers .
So they can collect sunlight from a big area .
That &apos;s another wonderful opportunity that &apos;s opening .
That would be a fun thing to do .
Thank you .
Seyi Oyesola : A hospital tour in Nigeria
I graduated high school in Cleveland , Ohio , 1975 .
Finished university education , got a medical degree , 1986 .
Very interesting .
How many people do you think are on that taxi ?
Believe it or not , some of us do survive .
Some of us do survive malaria ; we do survive AIDS .
That &apos;s sterilizing equipment in Nigeria .
You remember all that oil ?
You can say some of this is education .
And that &apos;s my specialty , right ?
Anesthesiology and critical care -- look at that bag .
And believe me , these are current pictures .
So , these are the problems .
There we go -- we &apos;re going on a mission .
Health is wealth , in the words of Hans Rosling .
You get wealthier faster if you are healthy first .
So , here we are , mission . Big trouble .
Open-heart surgery in Nigeria -- big trouble .
That &apos;s Mike , Mike comes out from Mississippi .
Does he look like he &apos;s happy ?
Yes , let &apos;s just go work this thing out .
We get a lot of donated equipment .
So what we going to do now ?
I mean , what &apos;s an X-ray viewing box ? Please .
Well , nowadays everything &apos;s on PAX anyway .
And we were doing open-heart surgery .
You still get people who believe in it and they came .
At 67 percent oxygen saturation , the normal is about 97 .
The oxygen tanks didn &apos;t quite work right .
But how many did we do the first one ? 12 .
We did 12 open-heart surgical patients successfully .
This is what I mean about appropriate technology .
Have you seen one of those before ?
No ? Yes ? Doesn &apos;t matter , it worked .
Thank you . Sustainable Solutions -- this was my first company .
And that &apos;s a perfect example of one .
That &apos;s exactly how the outlets are designed .
Is it dental surgery you want ? General surgery you want ?
Decide which instruments , stock it up with consumables .
And currently we &apos;re working on oxygen -- oxygen delivery on-site .
The technology for oxygen delivery is not new .
This is what makes it so special .
This picture was taken last year .
These are members of my graduating class , 1986 .
Thank you .
Dan Pallotta : The way we think about charity is dead wrong
I want to talk about social innovation and social entrepreneurship .
I happen to have triplets .
They &apos;re little . They &apos;re five years old .
Sometimes I tell people I have triplets .
They say , &quot; Really ? How many ? &quot;
Here &apos;s a picture of the kids .
That &apos;s Sage and Annalisa and Rider .
Now , I also happen to be gay .
The real social innovation I want to talk about involves charity .
How do you monetize that ?
And that &apos;s where the nonprofit sector and philanthropy come in .
Philanthropy is the market for love .
But it doesn &apos;t seem to be working .
We have two rulebooks .
We &apos;ll put you on the cover of Wired magazine .
Not necessarily . They might be smart .
The second area of discrimination is advertising and marketing .
But I don &apos;t want my donations spent on advertising .
I want it go to the needy . &quot;
But they have to be asked .
The fourth area is time .
And the last area is profit itself .
All of the scale goes to Coca-Cola and Burger King .
So why do we think this way ?
Making all this money will get you sent directly to Hell .
What were they to do about this ?
Well , charity became their answer .
There are a lot of problems with this question .
I &apos;m going to just focus on two .
2002 was our most successful year ever .
And then we went out of business , suddenly and traumatically .
Our sponsor went and tried the events on their own .
The overhead went up .
This is what happens when we confuse morality with frugality .
Here &apos;s how all of this impacts the big picture .
That &apos;s about 300 billion dollars a year .
Now we &apos;re talking scale .
Now we &apos;re talking the potential for real change .
Dan Pallotta : Thank you very much . Thank you .
Thank you .
Jamil Abu-Wardeh : The Axis of Evil Middle East Comedy Tour
This talk is about righting writing wrongs .
No , the sound &apos;s not faulty -- righting writing wrongs .
I think humor is a great way to celebrate our differences .
We need to take our responsibilities seriously , but not ourselves .
And wherever they went , they killed .
Now , I had friends in the U.S.
who had started a successful new tribe .
I had four phases to this plan .
Now , fast forward two years , to early 2007 .
Here &apos;s how the dots connected .
Our new French CEO believed in the power of positive PR ...
and ideas du bon marche .
Let &apos;s just say &quot; value for money . &quot;
This is all true .
Stay away from bolitics in the Middle East .
Now , were the Axis successful ?
We had millions see them on TV and on TV news .
Anywhere you go .
So everywhere we went , we auditioned amateurs .
We filmed that process and aired a documentary .
I called it &quot; Three Guys and Wonho . &quot;
It really is his name .
20 years ago , no one had heard of it .
Look at it now .
These comics are now going to the New York festival .
Enough .
We have a positive story to tell and image to sell .
Three : Is the Middle Eastern character being played by one ?
Clearly , there are wrongs that need to be righted .
We &apos;ve started in our region .
Thank you .
Saki Mafundikwa : Ingenuity and elegance in ancient African alphabets
And I called it the Zimbabwe Institute of Vigital Arts .
Some logos designed by my students .
So it &apos;s a special-interest writing system .
It &apos;s called Sankofa .
All the paths lead to and from God .
Shü-mom is a writing system .
It &apos;s a syllabary . It &apos;s not exactly an alphabet .
It &apos;s a syllabary and reads from left to right .
It is also time that designers in Africa stop looking outside .
Thank you very much .
Mark Roth : Suspended animation is within our grasp
So then there &apos;s also my favorite example of suspended animation .
This is Sea-Monkeys .
Those of you with children , you know about them .
Well , I wasn &apos;t so interested in the swimming .
She got cranky and just went home .
So , these are miracles , right ?
These are truly miraculous things that happen .
And it &apos;s true . It &apos;s true .
That &apos;s over 50 percent .
And here &apos;s the thing that should freak you out .
We can see it in a variety of different organisms .
One of the creatures we see it in is a fish .
But , of course , she was also extremely cold .
It &apos;s a really good thing .
You know ?
And so , we went looking for such things .
And this was a period of time when we failed tremendously .
Well , we had a lot of them .
The researchers had to suit up just to enter it .
It &apos;s filled with this toxic gas , hydrogen sulfide .
Now , hydrogen sulfide is curiously present in us .
We make it ourselves .
The highest concentration is in our brains .
It &apos;s an extraordinarily toxic thing .
It &apos;s really going to be OK . &quot;
I mean , who knows ?
It stopped moving .
It appeared dead .
Its oxygen consumption rate fell by tenfold .
And here &apos;s the really important point .
I told you hydrogen sulfide is in us .
Now , this was cosmic .
Well this was really cool .
I founded a company called Ikaria with others &apos; help .
And also the wonderful scientists and businesspeople at Ikaria .
A miracle ?
Thank you very much .
Rufus Griscom + Alisa Volkman : Let &apos;s talk parenting taboos
AV : We did .
AV : That spawned a dating site .
That &apos;s a subject that we want to dive into .
These are our three sons .
I remember vividly , sitting there in the hospital .
AV : We , or I ?
RG : I &apos;m sorry .
Misuse of the pronoun .
And I was there with my arms open .
So I was bracing myself for the moment .
And you can see , our eyes were glistening .
And it was also , of course , surreal .
And this was all quite remarkable .
And so we &apos;ve done something here that is heretical .
We have charted our love for our child over time .
This , as you know , is an act of heresy .
You &apos;re not allowed to chart love .
You love , or you don &apos;t love .
So I actually threw a pop quiz here onto Rufus .
RG : Uh oh .
RG : The far left . AV : No !
RG : Cruel .
AV : Nothing more to be said .
I &apos;ll move on to taboo number two .
I enjoyed being pregnant . I loved it .
I felt incredibly connected to the community around me .
That continued into the the hospital . It was really exhilarating .
I was shower with gifts and flowers and visitors .
So Alisa &apos;s experience is not isolated .
So your 58 percent of mothers surveyed report feelings of loneliness .
This is actually the last little image we have of him .
And it was obviously a very difficult time -- really painful .
So it was a very difficult time .
And I think , miscarriage is an invisible loss .
There &apos;s not really a lot of community support around it .
There &apos;s really no ceremony , rituals , or rites .
This chart is comprised of four completely independent studies .
We were despondent .
We said , something is wrong here .
There &apos;s something missing from these studies .
It can &apos;t possibly be that bad .
As you get older , you become more stable .
So I &apos;m not going to go .
RG : And so in effect , we trade average happiness .
There &apos;s another factor in our case .
Everybody knows , you should absolutely not work with your spouse .
It &apos;s a bad idea . Don &apos;t do it . &quot;
And we obviously went forward . We did .
And so how about that average baseline of happiness ?
Can we move that up a little bit ?
RG + AV : Thank you .
Steve Jurvetson : Model rocketry
Baking soda and vinegar .
And the boys get bigger , and the rockets get bigger .
These rockets use experimental motors like nitrous oxide .
They use solid propellant most frequently .
It &apos;s a strange kind of love .
Mavericks : we had to call it Rocket Mavericks .
Here was a drag race .
Sometimes they just explode before your eyes or come down supersonic .
Voices : Woohoo ! Yeah . Nice .
They &apos;re yelling deploy . Voices : Oh shit .
Voices : It &apos;s going ballistic . Oh shit .
SJ : And I &apos;ll just be quiet .
Voices : No .
Up , up , up .
Things often go wrong .
It &apos;s a cadence you can &apos;t quite imagine .
Thank you .
Sebastian Wernicke : Lies , damned lies and statistics
And that &apos;s a huge amount of data .
Could you create the ultimate TEDTalk ?
Oh , well .
How should you deliver your talk ?
Now , while ...
I &apos;ll give you three examples .
You &apos;ll all stay with me .
It &apos;s perfectly fine .
Now , let &apos;s go to the visuals .
The most obvious visual thing on stage is the speaker .
Slides are okay , though you might consider going for props .
Color plays a very important role .
And I call this tool the TEDPad .
So , download it and have fun with it .
Now I hope you enjoy the session .
Freeman Hrabowski : 4 pillars of college success in science
And so I begin with a story about my childhood .
We all are products of our childhood experiences .
And there was a designated kicker every day .
And they said his name was Dr. Martin Luther King .
And they said , &quot; Absolutely not . &quot;
And we had a rough go of it .
You make me go to this . You make me listen .
And they thought about it all night .
And they came into my room the next morning .
They had not slept .
And they decided to do it .
I wanted a better education .
I did not want to have to have hand-me-down books .
And the real question is , what lessons did we learn ?
And it has been for 50 years an experiment .
We produced great artists . Beckett is our muse .
A lot of our students get into theater .
It &apos;s great work .
That &apos;s a big deal . It really is .
Quite frankly , you &apos;re talking about Americans .
Well a part of it , of course , is K-12 .
We need to strengthen K-12 .
I know . I know . I know .
We need to find ways of making it happen .
Number one : high expectations .
Smart simply means you &apos;re ready to learn .
Every foundation makes the difference in the next level .
He retook the course .
He now works at Harvard .
Nice story . Give him a hand for that too .
Secondly , it &apos;s not about test scores only .
But she had a factor that was very important .
She never missed a day of school , K-12 .
There was fire in that belly .
Big hand for her . Big hand for her .
And so high expectations , very important .
Secondly , the idea of building community among the students .
Students are not taught to work in groups .
So building community among those students , very important .
And so our students are working in labs regularly .
They had food they had packed out .
They knew they were working on AIDS research .
They were looking at this amazing protein design .
Let me get the staff to help me out . &quot;
It was that connecting .
Give him a big hand for that .
And so we redesigned chemistry , we redesigned physics .
Because so many students are bored in class .
Do you know that ?
They need to be engaged .
It &apos;s called academic innovation .
And what does all of that mean ?
Aristotle said , &quot; Excellence is never an accident .
It represents the wisest option among many alternatives . &quot;
And then he said something that gives me goosebumps .
Thank you all very much .
Thomas Thwaites : How I built a toaster -- from scratch
They look like TV cameras , monitors , annoying radio mics .
But he didn &apos;t have Wikipedia .
I had maybe nine months .
So I thought , okay , I &apos;ll start with five .
So , starting with steel : how do you make steel ?
And Professor Cilliers was very kind and talked me through it .
Can I come up and get some iron ? &quot;
Unfortunately , when I got there -- emerges Ray .
But after some nagging , I got him to do that .
But instead of a bellows , I had a leaf blower .
I dragged out this stuff , and it wasn &apos;t iron .
That &apos;s me getting mica .
Plastic is the defining feature of cheap electrical goods .
BP obviously has a bit more on their mind now .
So I looked at other ways of making plastic .
So this is attempting to make potato starch plastic .
And for a while that was looking really good .
But this is it .
So there &apos;s a picture of my toaster .
That &apos;s it without the case on .
And there it is on the shelves .
Thanks .
I &apos;m told you did plug it in once .
TT : Yeah , I did plug it in .
So the wires were uninsulated .
But I considered it a partial success , to be honest .
Thomas Thwaites . TT : Thanks .
Jane Chen : A warm embrace that saves lives
Please close your eyes , and open your hands .
Now open your eyes .
What about a life ?
What you see here is a premature baby .
Four million of these babies die annually .
That is the primary function of an incubator .
I &apos;ve seen this firsthand over and over again .
So , this is what we came up with .
What you see here looks nothing like an incubator .
It looks like a small sleeping bag for a baby .
You can open it up completely . It &apos;s waterproof .
But the magic is in this pouch of wax .
This is a phase-change material .
But the longer-term social impact is a reduction in population growth .
In designing this we followed a few basic principles .
It &apos;s a pretty accurate description .
Today , we will see 250,000 individual new computer viruses .
We will see 30,000 new infected websites .
People normally write that down , by the way .
Today &apos;s cybercriminal , what do they look like ?
But actually today , cybercriminals are wonderfully professional and organized .
In fact , they have product adverts .
Check out this one I found .
Turns out that &apos;s not cool .
But it goes further .
So let me show you what malicious code looks like today .
Now , there are many ways you can get infected .
You will have come in contact with some of them .
Now there are many ways you can get infected .
I want to show you a couple of my favorites .
This is a little USB key .
Well , you could try looking really cute .
Awww .
Or , in my case , awkward and pathetic .
So let &apos;s have a look here on my victim computer .
Malware is very boring otherwise .
We can access your documents , your data .
You can turn on the webcam .
That can be very embarrassing .
Let me show you how most malware is now distributed today .
This is a script .
It &apos;s code which will be interpreted on the webpage .
Notice that after a couple of seconds , I get redirected .
It creates some very serious alerts .
Oh look , a child porn proxy server .
We really should clean that up .
Now I liked it better when viruses were free .
So anyway , let me change pace a little bit .
So let &apos;s take this a little further .
There are a few other interesting pieces the cybercriminals had uploaded .
And our cybercriminals had done the same thing .
So here &apos;s a photo which resolves to St. Petersburg .
We then deploy the incredibly advanced hacking tool .
We used Google .
One of these was more stereotypical for me .
A little more searching , and here &apos;s our cybercriminal .
Imagine , these are hardened cybercriminals sharing information scarcely .
They were working on the third floor .
But this is where our investigation starts to slow down .
The cybercriminals have locked down their profiles quite well .
Now you &apos;re probably wondering what happened to these guys .
Let me come back to that in just a minute .
So I ran a little scan .
Okay ? So you can see a list of wireless networks .
TEDAttendees , HyattLB . Where do you think I &apos;m staying ?
Sophos _ Visitors , SANSEMEA , companies I work with .
Loganwifi , that &apos;s in Boston . HiltonLondon .
CIASurveillanceVan .
This is how geeks party .
So let &apos;s make this a little bit more interesting .
Let &apos;s talk about you .
Things get more interesting .
And two percent of you have a tendency to extreme profanity .
Would someone be able to abuse it ? &quot;
Get a secure password .
Find these resources . Apply them .
Thank you .
Raul Midon : &quot; Peace on Earth &quot;
This song kind of came out of all of that .
It &apos;s called &quot; Peace on Earth . &quot;
Which brought us to this .
So think of this as a choose-your-own-adventure of an album .
Let &apos;s take a closer look .
Let &apos;s look at one example here .
This is then joined by the sound of sweeping violins .
Thank you .
Marco Tempest : The electric rise and fall of Nikola Tesla
So let the story begin .
Lightning lit the sky , and a baby was born .
His name was Nikola , Nikola Tesla .
Now the baby grew into a very smart guy .
Let me show you .
Tesla , what is 236 multiplied by 501 ?
Nikola Tesla : The result is 118,236 .
Tree . Chair . Girl .
They were hallucinations , which vanished the moment he touched them .
Probably a form of synesthesia .
But it was something he later turned to his advantage .
NT : I needed no models , drawings or experiments .
Only then do I construct it .
MT : His great idea was alternating current .
To sell his idea , he became a showman .
It is the magic of science .
He even photographed the bones of the human body .
But Tesla &apos;s success didn &apos;t last .
NT : I had bigger ideas .
Illuminating the city was only the beginning .
NT : They wouldn &apos;t give me the money .
NT : Yes , that was a big mistake .
MT : Tesla &apos;s career as an inventor never recovered .
He became a recluse .
His legacy is with us still .
Tesla &apos;s insight was profound .
MT : Tesla thought he had the answer .
We are still asking the question .
Thank you .
Michelle Obama : A plea for education
Can you believe that ?
The special relationship between the United States and the U.K.
There is nothing in my story that would land me here .
I was raised on the South Side of Chicago .
That &apos;s the real part of Chicago .
And I was the product of a working-class community .
Neither of them attended university .
He was grateful for what he had .
I know , how romantic .
But when we met , Barack was a community organizer .
And I talked about this throughout the entire campaign .
We know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like .
We all know .
You &apos;re going to write the next chapter in history .
And that &apos;s why getting a good education is so important .
And that &apos;s important to keep in mind .
Part of that health includes an outstanding education .
They allowed for no obstacles .
As the sign said back there , &quot; without limitations . &quot;
And having done so , these women moved many obstacles .
Please remember that .
I never did it .
I loved getting As .
I liked being smart .
I thought being smart was cooler than anything in the world .
You too can pave the way .
You now have control over your own destiny .
And it won &apos;t be easy -- that &apos;s for sure .
But you have everything you need .
My husband works in this big office .
They call it the Oval Office .
Because we are counting on you .
Because the world is big .
And it &apos;s full of challenges .
Chrystia Freeland : The rise of the new global super-rich
So here &apos;s the most important economic fact of our time .
The 0.1 percent in the U.S.
today account for more than eight percent of the national income .
They are where the One Percent was 30 years ago .
Just think about it .
But I think there &apos;s something else going on .
In practice , getting rid of crony capitalism is incredibly difficult .
In and of themselves , these aren &apos;t too mysterious .
Just think about it .
The latest poster boy for this phenomenon is David Karp .
We have superstar technologists .
We have superstar bankers .
We have superstar lawyers and superstar architects .
There are superstar cooks and superstar farmers .
Let &apos;s start with technology .
I love the Internet . I love my mobile devices .
I &apos;m even more of a fan of globalization .
Think of your dishwasher or your t-shirt .
So what &apos;s not to like ?
Well , a few things .
And that &apos;s no mere hypothetical example .
Think about Amazon , Apple , Google , Starbucks .
Again , this is no mere hypothetical .
As income inequality increases , social mobility decreases .
Let &apos;s start with technology .
When &apos;s the last time you used a travel agent ?
The same is true of globalization .
What worries me more is a different nightmare scenario .
We created the modern welfare state .
We created public education .
We created public health care .
We created public pensions .
We created unions .
We need a new New Deal .
Anna Mracek Dietrich : A plane you can drive
What is it about flying cars ?
We &apos;ve wanted to do this for about a hundred years .
And the result is the Terrafugia Transition .
You take off and land at a local airport .
And it works .
within the light sport aircraft category .
And at 110 lbs . , driving .
Now let &apos;s see it in action .
And that &apos;s the automated wing-folding mechanism .
That &apos;s real time .
Radio : It actually flew . Yes .
Radio 2 : That was gorgeous .
Radio : What did you think of that ?
That was beautiful from up here , I tell you .
The Transition will cost in line with other small airplanes .
Here &apos;s why .
And mobility to your destination is clearly solved .
Just fold up the wings and keep going .
It also continues to be a fabulous adventure .
Devdutt Pattanaik : East vs. West -- the myths that mystify
&quot; How come ? &quot; said Kartikeya .
&apos;My world &apos; is subjective .
It &apos;s emotional . It &apos;s personal .
It &apos;s perceptions , thoughts , feelings , dreams .
It is the belief system that we carry .
It &apos;s the myth that we live in .
Different people see things differently -- different viewpoints .
Yours is faith .
Yours is illogical .
This is the root of the clash of civilizations .
It took place , once , in 326 B.C.
This river lends itself to India &apos;s name .
India . Indus .
We don &apos;t know who he was .
Alexander asked , &quot; What are you doing ? &quot;
and the gymnosophist answered , &quot; I &apos;m experiencing nothingness . &quot;
Then the gymnosophist asked , &quot; What are you doing ? &quot;
and Alexander said , &quot; I am conquering the world . &quot;
And they both laughed .
Each one thought that the other was a fool .
The gymnosophist said , &quot; Why is he conquering the world ?
It &apos;s pointless . &quot;
What a waste of a life . &quot;
That &apos;s what he heard .
&quot; What should you not be ?
But these are not the stories that the gymnosophist heard .
He heard a very different story .
Bharat also conquered the world .
that &apos;s what I thought until I came here . &quot;
This was the mythology of the gymnosophist .
But they were not two characters on two different adventures .
They were two lifetimes of the same hero .
When the Ramayana ends the Mahabharata begins .
When Ram dies , Krishna is born .
When Krishna dies , eventually he will be back as Ram .
But you don &apos;t cross it once .
You go to and fro endlessly .
It was called the Vaitarani .
You go again and again and again .
And what do you do at the end of 10 days ?
You dunk it in the river .
Because it has to end .
And next year , she will come back .
&quot; Groundhog Day . &quot;
Two different mythologies .
Which is right ?
One linear , one cyclical .
One believes this is the one and only life .
The other believes this is one of many lives .
And so , the denominator of Alexander &apos;s life was one .
The denominator of the gymnosophist &apos;s life was infinity .
Who knows ?
And that brings us to the mythology of business .
Take a look .
And then look at business .
Standard business model : vision , mission , values , processes .
And if you comply , you will go to heaven .
But in India there is no &quot; the &quot; promised land .
It &apos;s always about taste .
It &apos;s always about my taste .
There is no orchestra conductor .
There is one performer standing there , and everybody follows .
And you can never replicate that performance twice .
It is not about documentation and contract .
It &apos;s about conversation and faith .
And people are okay with it .
And then globalization is taking place .
The demands of modern institutional thinking is coming in .
Which is rooted in one-life culture .
It is bound to happen .
I love mythology too much .
So , I had to teach it to myself .
And mythology does not pay , well , until now .
And I worked in the healthcare industry .
I even was a business consultant , doing strategies and tactics .
Example : Please tell us the process to invoice hospitals .
Step A. Step B. Step C. Mostly .
How do you parameterize &quot; mostly &quot; ?
I would give my viewpoints to people .
And he was dealing with diverse and dynamic markets .
He had an intuitive understanding of the mythic structure of India .
Sounds so simple .
But belief is not measurable .
You can &apos;t measure it . You can &apos;t manage it .
So , how do you construct belief ?
How do you enhance the sensitivity of people to Indian-ness .
And I will share one of the rituals with you .
You see it is based on the Hindu ritual of Darshan .
Hindus don &apos;t have the concept of commandments .
You want to see God .
And based on this , we created a ritual for leaders .
The customer is happy , because the customer is God .
And it has .
So , I will not answer the question .
You see , because both the paradigms are human constructions .
They are cultural creations , not natural phenomena .
Understand it .
And when you understand it you will discover something spectacular .
You will discover that within infinite myths lies the eternal truth .
Who sees it all ?
Varuna has but a thousand eyes .
Indra , a hundred .
You and I , only two .
Thank you . Namaste .
Renata Salecl : Our unhealthy obsession with choice
The sweet anxiety of choice .
Let me give you an example .
But what you are buying now is great . &quot;
Now , why were Manya &apos;s customers so irrational ?
Now , we rarely make really totally rational choices .
Choices are influenced by our unconscious , by our community .
Also we are choosing by looking at what others are choosing .
We &apos;re also guessing what is socially acceptable choice .
Now , choices are anxiety-provoking .
They are linked to risks , losses .
They are highly unpredictable .
And now , I need to choose a sperm donor . &quot;
I looked at this woman in shock .
&quot; Sperm donor ? What &apos;s the rush ? &quot;
Now , we think today that we can prevent these risks .
We have endless market analysis , projections of the future earnings .
Now , chance is actually becoming very traumatic .
Now , we delivered the conference in such a way .
We decoded our genome .
We know about our brains more than before .
Ignorance and denial are on the rise .
Now , what does that mean ?
And who would want to tax one &apos;s son ?
We are anxious that we are not good enough .
And there is an important message that I did learn .
It really prevented us to think about social change .
We can choose to have more wolves .
We can choose to change our environment to have more bees .
We can choose to have different rating agencies .
We have a possibility to make changes .
Thank you .
Kent Larson : Brilliant designs to fit more people in every city
You needed easy access to the fields .
Life was very small for most people .
That &apos;s where babies were born and people died .
Then , with industrialization , everything started to become centralized .
Production was centralized in assembly plants .
You had centralized energy production .
And then you had networks that developed .
You had separated functions , increasingly .
Imagine that .
Cities are places of celebration , personal expression .
Now there &apos;s some trends that will impact cities .
First of all , work is becoming distributed and mobile .
The office building is basically obsolete for doing private work .
And that &apos;s a very important trend to think about .
So this is my image of the city of the future .
In that it &apos;s a place for people , you know .
How can we have the good stuff without the bad ?
The 20 arrondissements of Paris are these little neighborhoods .
So we said , let &apos;s start with that neighborhood cell .
We think of it as a compact urban cell .
And he might be right .
This is even a more interesting solution in Seoul , Korea .
The Highline in Manhattan is very similar .
We actually did exactly the wrong thing in Boston .
You just spin and go directly in .
It &apos;s not really a problem .
You have nobody to make eye contact with .
We hope to have that built this fall .
Housing is another area where we can really improve .
Developers say , okay , we &apos;ll build little teeny apartments .
That &apos;s sort of a bogus concept .
That means twice as much parking , though .
You add shared use , and you can even go further .
We think these little wireless sensors are more effective .
We think we can also personalize sunlight .
That &apos;s sort of the ultimate personalization in some ways .
This can be combined with LED lighting as well .
We think workplaces should be shared .
This is Starbucks , you know .
We need shared spaces for interaction and collaboration .
We &apos;re not doing a very good job with that .
They &apos;re places for people .
Thank you .
Clay Shirky : How the Internet will transform government
Let &apos;s start here .
Can you spot the vegetable ?
This was a zero day . That &apos;s good .
And then two weeks ago yesterday , she posted this .
A post that read : &quot; Goodbye . &quot;
I really enjoyed doing this .
Thank you for reading . Goodbye . &quot;
You can guess what happened next , right ?
Except , of course , this morning .
Now , this isn &apos;t just a contemporaneous question .
What would this lead to ?
Well , obviously , it would lead to world peace .
World peace .
The telephone ?
You guessed it : world peace .
What they got exactly wrong was what happens next .
More media always means more arguing .
That &apos;s what happens when the media &apos;s space expands .
We are a pro-printing press society .
But the other thing they needed was speed .
The scientific revolution wasn &apos;t created by the printing press .
Well , predictions of world peace ? Check .
More arguing ? Gold star on that one .
I mean , YouTube is just a gold mine .
Better arguing ? That &apos;s the question .
All right . They look like org charts .
This is feudalism : one owner , many workers .
Now , that &apos;s fine for the commercial software industry .
The corporation owns the software .
The programmers come and go .
This is Linus Torvalds .
His point of view on this was very clear .
This is a tremendously complicated process .
It has two big differences with traditional version control systems .
This is cooperation without coordination .
This is the big change .
This is a graph of the Ruby community .
So , the law is also dependency-related .
So there &apos;s that as a site for source code management .
Right .
And it includes this very evocative screenshot .
The stuff in red is the stuff that got deleted .
The stuff in green is the stuff that got added .
Programmers take this capability for granted .
This , graphically , was the answer .
The bigger problem , of course , is power .
They are experimenting with openness .
So consider this .
We have them . We &apos;ve seen them . They work .
Can we use them ?
Can we apply the techniques that worked here to this ?
Thank you for listening .
Thank you . Thank you .
Esther Duflo : Social experiments to fight poverty
Maybe a sobering thought and something you all know about .
That &apos;s a Haiti earthquake every eight days .
So why is that ?
Well , here is a thought experiment for you .
Or maybe you turn to the past .
After all , we have spent billions of dollars on aid .
Maybe you look at the past and see .
Has it done any good ?
And , sadly , we don &apos;t know .
And worst of all , we will never know .
And the reason is that -- take Africa for example .
Africans have already got a lot of aid .
These are the blue bars .
And the GDP in Africa is not making much progress .
There &apos;s only one Africa .
So what do you do ?
Sometimes the patient gets better , sometimes the patient dies .
Is it the leeches ? Is it something else ?
We don &apos;t know .
So here are some other questions .
They &apos;re smaller questions , but they are not that small .
So you have your million .
In fact , that is the leading cause of under-five mortality .
Bed nets are very cheap .
&quot; Not so fast , &quot; say other people .
So , what do you do ?
How do you know ?
And a third question : Education .
But how do you do that ?
Do you hire teachers ? Do you build more schools ?
Do you provide school lunch ?
How do you know ?
So here is the thing .
But these three questions , I can answer them .
And I &apos;ll give you some examples with those three questions .
So I start with immunization .
Here &apos;s Udaipur District , Rajasthan . Beautiful .
That &apos;s bad , but there are places like that .
So you get these empty village subcenters and crowded hospitals .
So what is the problem ?
But maybe there is another problem as well .
It &apos;s going from intention to action .
Imagine you are a mother in Udaipur District , Rajasthan .
So these are simple ideas , but we didn &apos;t know .
So let &apos;s try them .
So the blue dots are selected randomly .
The white dots are comparisons , nothing changed .
Now , a kilo of lentils is tiny .
So what do we find ?
Well , beforehand , everything is the same .
That &apos;s the beauty of randomization .
That &apos;s full immunization .
That &apos;s not bad , that &apos;s a good improvement .
Add the lentils and you reach to 38 percent .
So here you &apos;ve got your answer .
We cannot keep giving lentils to people . &quot;
How about bed nets ?
So the answer hinges on the answer to three simple questions .
We can know the answer to this question .
We can just run an experiment .
And now we can see what happens .
So , how about the purchasing ?
Second thing is , how about the use ?
If they get it for free , they use it .
If they have to pay for it , they use it .
How about the long term ?
Maybe we need to give them a little bit more credit .
But what politicians need is a range of options .
So suppose your goal is to get kids into school .
So what &apos;s the best ?
Consider for example transporting goods .
So why shouldn &apos;t we do the same with social policy ?
Suppose you have 100 dollars to spend on various interventions .
And here are the most surprising results .
And they are good , scientific , robust answers .
So let &apos;s go back to Haiti for a moment .
And yet it doesn &apos;t happen .
So , why is that ?
And the problem of poverty is not like that .
There &apos;s no silver bullet .
You cannot helicopter people out of poverty .
And that &apos;s very frustrating .
But look what we just did today .
Here &apos;s an example of how this can be powerful .
Deworming .
Worms have a little bit of a problem grabbing the headlines .
They are not beautiful and don &apos;t kill anybody .
So this evidence is powerful .
It can prompt action .
So we should get started now .
It &apos;s not going to be easy .
It &apos;s a very slow process .
And sometimes what works somewhere doesn &apos;t work elsewhere .
It &apos;s a slow , deliberative process of discovery .
I believe we can and I hope we will .
Thank you .
Parag Khanna : Mapping the future of countries
Do we live in a borderless world ?
Before you answer that , have a look at this map .
That &apos;s probably more than at any time in centuries .
Now , many of you will object .
For you this would be a more appropriate map .
You could call it TEDistan .
How do we distribute ourselves around the world ?
Let &apos;s start with the world of 1945 .
1945 there were just 100 countries in the world .
Over 50 new countries were born .
You can see that Africa has been fragmented .
India , Pakistan , Bangladesh , South East Asian nations created .
Then came the end of the Cold War .
Today we have 200 countries in the world .
The entire planet is covered by sovereign , independent nation-states .
And as you know , China is the most populous .
And they share a lengthy land border .
And only 30 million people are in its eastern areas .
Why do they call it that ?
China isn &apos;t conquering Mongolia .
It &apos;s buying it .
Colonies were once conquered . Today countries are bought .
So let &apos;s apply this principle to Siberia .
But who is it going to feed ?
That &apos;s larger than the entire population of Russia .
They set up their own bazaars and medical clinics .
That &apos;s what I call globalization Chinese style .
But hold on . This map is 700 years old .
Again , globalization Chinese style .
Well it &apos;s China &apos;s turn again .
It starts with the global hubs .
These are the filters and funnels of global capital .
Then there is trade .
Another pillar of this strategy is diplomacy .
China has signed military agreements with many countries in the region .
Another pillar of the strategy , like Russia , is demographic .
Chinese pride is resurgent in the region as a result .
Singapore , for example , used to ban Chinese language education .
Now it encourages it .
If you add it all up what do you get ?
All of this is happening without firing a shot .
What lines on the map should we focus on ?
Let &apos;s start with Iraq .
The reason is Kurdistan .
But what are they guarding ?
Is it really a border on the map ?
No . It &apos;s the pipelines .
I don &apos;t believe we should .
Now remember Kurdistan is landlocked .
It has no choice but to behave .
And therefore it has to have amicable relations with them .
Now lets look at a perennial conflict in the region .
That is , of course , in Palestine .
Today donors are spending billions of dollars on this .
This is the Hejaz Railway .
The Hejaz Railway ran from Istanbul to Medina via Damascus .
But today the Hejaz Railway lies in tatters , ruins .
These countries &apos; borders originate from Stalin &apos;s decrees .
He purposely did not want these countries to make sense .
Why is it all he &apos;s talking about is oil ? &quot;
Before it was , how do we control their oil ?
Now it &apos;s their oil for their own purposes .
A great deal of them .
Just take Azerbaijan .
It was more considered South Siberia during the Soviet Union .
The Great Game connotes dominance of one over the other .
Silk road connotes independence and mutual trust .
And that is , of course , Europe .
In fact most of that happened on just one day .
In 2004 , 15 new countries joined the E.U.
Now let &apos;s look at Turkey and the Caucasus .
I mentioned Azerbaijan before .
Of course , we can &apos;t forget Africa .
Now let &apos;s go up to the Arctic Circle .
Who will win ? Canada ? Russia ? The United States ?
Actually Greenland .
So Denmark is about to get a whole lot smaller .
What is the lesson from all of this ?
Geopolitics is a very unsentimental discipline .
Now we fear changes on the map .
Thank you .
Elizabeth Lesser : Take &quot; the Other &quot; to lunch
I was the freak of the family .
So , looking for answers , I went to Catholic mass .
I tagged along with my neighbors .
I read Sartre and Socrates .
Now , see this strange , underwater , coral reef-looking thing ?
They &apos;ve made me a proud I-don &apos;t-know-it-all .
She &apos;s worried .
They &apos;re supposedly tongue-in-cheek , but they &apos;re actually dangerous .
Who wrote that ?
And then they morph into violent extremism .
This is why I &apos;m launching a new initiative .
Or someone from the other side of the abortion conflict .
Or maybe your brother-in-law who doesn &apos;t believe in global warming .
Now on paper , she passed my smoking ears test .
Be curious ; be conversational ; be real .
And listen .
From there , we dove in .
What issues deeply concern you ?
I think it has relevance to any problem between people anywhere .
&quot; What ? &quot; she wanted to know .
Well , she was shocked .
Neither of us had tried to change the other .
Who should you invite to lunch ?
And what might happen at your lunch ?
Probably not .
Because ubuntu work is slow , and it &apos;s difficult .
It &apos;s two people dropping the pretense of being know-it-alls .
I &apos;ll meet you there . &quot;
Alwar Balasubramaniam : Art of substance and absence
How did you do ? &quot;
And then school also started supporting me .
So I just switched on in the train , loudly .
You know , like just adjacent to me .
I think you should study in a school of art .
You just quit school and come there . &quot;
But it is just a kind of trace of that time .
And that fascinated me , to explore that territory .
So this is called &quot; Self In Progress . &quot;
It &apos;s just a trace of being in this body .
It &apos;s almost like a 3D photograph .
So it &apos;s almost like fossils for the future .
This is called &quot; Dawn to Dawn . &quot;
So it took about 24 hours to get this line .
So like let &apos;s say even a simple act .
Can you just raise the hand ?
Why the cow was crossing the road , you know .
The answer can be so different if Potter said it .
He would say , &quot; For the greater good . &quot;
It just all depends on one &apos;s perception .
And context , what is really context ?
Because I always think meaning doesn &apos;t really exist .
It &apos;s just created by the mind .
This is how we &apos;ve been taught in school .
It &apos;s just captured through from the lamp .
This is called &quot; Limit Out . &quot;
This is an exact negative .
And we &apos;re just pulling the wall off the gallery .
Again , &quot; Inward Out . &quot;
It &apos;s a full-figure cast from myself .
It &apos;s about eight inches deep .
Is there any way to capture the thought into visual art ?
I couldn &apos;t find it .
It &apos;s called Odonil .
This is the work I made out of that material .
Will you help me to make this sculpture ? &quot;
They never wrote back to me .
They said , &quot; Of course .
Please come for the show . &quot;
And they did .
And this work is in the Devi Art Foundation in Delhi .
It &apos;s just all about questioning the preconceptions .
It &apos;s in the same gallery or in the same museum .
And I was like , &quot; What do you mean ? &quot;
&quot; Light makes dark and now evaporating self .
Can you make something from nothing as a sculptor ? &quot;
So , I did this work for her .
It &apos;s called &quot; Emerging Angel . &quot;
So , the same sculpture after a few days .
This is after 15 / 20 days .
This gave me a greater faith .
So what you see now is called &quot; Shadow Foreshadow . &quot;
When it &apos;s bounced on the moon , we see it .
The same thing in the darkroom .
If we sculpt this , this has two reference points .
The skin of this is also representing this .
And skin at the other end also represents the floor .
I did this as an experiment of casting the shadow .
So this is a corrugated box and its shadow .
So that produced a shadow .
Then I thought , okay , let me sculpt that .
Then , again , that becomes an object .
Again , throwing light , then the third one .
You can see the detail .
This is called &quot; Gravity . &quot;
This is called &quot; Kaayam . &quot;
Detail .
Because when we see someone walks , we see the footprint .
Thank you .
Bandi Mbubi : Demand a fair trade cell phone
I came to the U.K. 21 years ago as an asylum-seeker .
I was 21 .
Can you imagine your world without it ?
It is a symbol of an interconnected world .
It is an anticorrosive heat conductor .
It stores energy in our mobile phones , Playstations and laptops .
It is used in aerospace and medical equipment as alloys .
It is so powerful that we only need tiny amounts .
It would be great if the story ended there .
But don &apos;t throw away your phones yet .
The Congo consistently scores dreadfully in global health and poverty rankings .
Coltan is easily controlled by armed groups .
It has truly revolutionized the way we communicate on the planet .
It has allowed momentous political change to take place .
So we are faced with a paradox .
It is time to be asking questions about technology .
Where does it come from ?
Who makes it ?
And for what ?
Recent U.K. legislation could be used in the same way .
But we &apos;re not there yet .
I missed my family and the friends I left behind .
Communication was extremely difficult .
We demand fair trade food and fair trade clothes .
It is time to demand fair trade phones .
This is an idea worth spreading . Thank you .
Kathryn Schulz : Don &apos;t regret regret
So that &apos;s Johnny Depp , of course .
And that &apos;s Johnny Depp &apos;s shoulder .
And that &apos;s Johnny Depp &apos;s famous shoulder tattoo .
And now his shoulder says , &quot; Wino forever . &quot;
That didn &apos;t happen to me .
Which is a great place to do it because nobody cares .
I do that hourly .
I learned a lesson from it .
And okay , I wouldn &apos;t change it .
until I tell you who said it .
It &apos;s called a lobotomy .
So let &apos;s start off by defining some terms .
What is regret ?
So in other words , regret requires two things .
And second of all , it requires imagination .
Why ?
&quot; I should have taken the bridge and not the tunnel .
I should have gone through that yellow light . &quot;
These are the classic conditions that create regret .
This session today is about behavioral economics .
Here &apos;s what the answers turn out to look like .
We wish we &apos;d gotten more of it .
We wish we &apos;d chosen to study a different topic .
They account for less than three percent of our total regrets .
We all know the short answer .
It feels terrible . Regret feels awful .
So the first consistent component of regret is basically denial .
And the thought was , &quot; Make it go away ! &quot;
This is an unbelievably primitive emotional response .
We &apos;re not trying to solve the problem .
We &apos;re not trying to understand how the problem came about .
We just want it to vanish .
The second characteristic component of regret is a sense of bewilderment .
What was I thinking ? &quot;
We can &apos;t identify with that part .
We don &apos;t understand that part .
Make it go away . Make it go away . &quot;
In point of fact , no insurance covers acts of idiocy .
This is obviously an incredibly painful experience .
Sometimes instead of Control-Z , we actually have zero control .
Text : Relpy to all .
Or you can just have an incredibly embarrassing day at work .
Or you can have your last day at work .
So how are we supposed to live with this ?
That is Johnny Depp and me and our seven million friends .
And that &apos;s just regret about tattoos .
We are all in this together .
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s the case though .
And do you guys just want to see it ?
All right .
Because it &apos;s actually not that hideous .
It &apos;s just that I don &apos;t like how it looks .
And as I said earlier , I &apos;m a perfectionist .
But I &apos;ll let you see it anyway .
This is my tattoo .
I can guess what some of you are thinking .
So let me reassure you about something .
Well it did .
The point isn &apos;t to live without any regrets .
The point is to not hate ourselves for having them .
Regret doesn &apos;t remind us that we did badly .
It reminds us that we know we can do better .
Thank you .
Jeff Han : The radical promise of the multi-touch interface
You know , like that .
Now , multi-touch sensing isn &apos;t completely new .
It &apos;s completely intuitive ; there &apos;s no instruction manual .
The interface just kind of disappears .
Google should have something like this in their lobby .
This is a photographer &apos;s light box application .
I can pan , zoom and rotate it effortlessly .
Again , the interface just disappears here .
Now , of course , I can bring up a keyboard .
And I can bring that around , put that up there .
That leads to bad things , like RSI .
This keyboard is probably actually the really wrong direction to go .
So -- again , isn &apos;t this great ?
Audience : Where &apos;s your lab ?
It &apos;s pressure-sensitive , you can notice .
It &apos;s just so much fun playing around with too .
And when I close it , it becomes a character .
And you notice what it does .
Thank you .
James Nachtwey : Moving photos of extreme drug-resistant TB
I believed the photographers and so did millions of other Americans .
Their images fuelled resistance to the war and to racism .
Thank you very much .
Toby Eccles : Invest in social change
Forty-three .
Seven .
It &apos;s got to be worth something , right ?
Now , of course , we care about the social value .
The idea is called the social impact bond .
So we have to raise some money .
We use the contract to raise money from socially motivated investors .
Socially motivated investors : there &apos;s an interesting idea , right ?
And here &apos;s the opportunity .
So we get paid for crimes saved .
So everyone wins here , right ?
Society wins : fewer crimes , fewer victims .
Now , the offenders , they also benefit .
So children in the state care tend to do very badly .
The state is not a great parent .
Investors have put in 3.1 million pounds .
That program started last month .
So what &apos;s caused this excitement ?
Why is this so different for people ?
The second piece it brings is rigor .
And we learn and adapt the program accordingly .
The last element is partnership .
And this creates a structure through which they can combine .
So where does this leave us ?
Thank you .
Alisa Miller : The news about the news
How does the news shape the way we see the world ?
And here &apos;s how news shapes what Americans see .
There was massive flooding in Indonesia .
The U.S. accounted for 79 percent of total news coverage .
What was that story ? The death of Anna Nicole Smith .
So , why don &apos;t we hear more about the world ?
The reality is that covering Britney is cheaper .
And what about the web ?
The most popular news sites don &apos;t do much better .
I know we can do better .
And can we afford not to ? Thank you .
Frederic Kaplan : How to build an information time machine
This is an image of the planet Earth .
This is pretty amazing .
i &apos;m not really sure when this picture was taken .
Is that possible ?
Can I reconstruct social networks of the past ?
Can I make a Facebook of the Middle Ages ?
So , can I build time machines ?
This is what I call the information mushroom .
Vertically , you have the time .
and horizontally , the amount of digital information available .
How do we do that ?
One way is digitization .
I can digitize all these .
I can extract information from these .
So , it might not be enough .
So , I can do what historians do .
I can extrapolate .
This is what we call , in computer science , simulation .
I &apos;m extrapolating .
We need very large archives , and we need excellent specialists .
You have every change that was made in the city .
This is all there .
And these are administrative documents .
They are well structured in many cases .
Actually probably 10 billion events can be extracted from this archive .
And this giant information system can be searched in many ways .
You have to put it in a larger European context .
&quot; How much will it cost ? &quot;
&quot; What are the chance of encountering pirates ? &quot;
So how can we detect and correct these inconsistencies ?
How can we represent that form of uncertainty ?
Maybe there &apos;s not a single map .
Maybe there are several maps .
Again , Venice is extraordinary for that .
It &apos;s really a question of scale .
I thank you very much .
Shyam Sankar : The rise of human-computer cooperation
I &apos;d like to tell you about two games of chess .
At first , the results were predictable .
The surprise came at the end . Who won ?
It &apos;s become the dominant school of thought in computer science .
Note that word &quot; cooperate . &quot;
Of course , in other ways , humans are so limited .
We &apos;re terrible at scale , computation and volume .
You can start by designing the human into the process .
What Kasparov calls process is a byproduct of friction .
The better the process , the less the friction .
And minimizing friction turns out to be the decisive variable .
Or take another example : big data .
These are necessary but insufficient questions .
Again , we start by designing the human into the process .
Osama bin Laden was not caught by artificial intelligence .
These records were human resource forms .
The foreign fighters filled them out as they joined the organization .
They answered questions like , &quot; Who recruited you ? &quot;
In that last question , a surprising insight was revealed .
Thank you .
Ian Goldin : Navigating our global future
The future , as we know it , is very unpredictable .
The best minds in the best institutions generally get it wrong .
And it &apos;s clearly in the area of finance .
Globalization is getting more complex .
And this change is getting more rapid .
The future will be more unpredictable .
It did this a thousand years ago .
The last 40 years have been extraordinary times .
Life expectancy has gone up by about 25 years .
It took from the Stone Age to achieve that .
But there is an underbelly .
There are two Achilles &apos; heels of globalization .
What happens in one place very quickly affects everything else .
This is a systemic risk , systemic shock .
It will continue .
So what will this do ?
It will create huge opportunities in technology .
Miniaturization as well .
This is a dust mite on a nanoreplica .
We can develop any part of the body .
Fantastic potential for regenerative medicine .
But the question is , &quot; Who will have it ? &quot;
So forget about retirements if you &apos;re young .
Of course , migration will become even more important .
This would imply a massive leap in migration .
And then , the systemic risks .
Small levels of stock push resilience into other people &apos;s responsibility .
It &apos;s going to require innovation .
How do we begin to weave these tapestries together ?
How do we think about complex systems in new ways ?
It is vital that we do so .
Thank you .
Paul Piff : Does money make you mean ?
They got two times as much money .
So we &apos;ve provided subtitles .
Rich Player : How many 500s did you have ?
Poor Player : Just one .
Rich Player : Are you serious . Poor Player : Yeah .
Rich Player : I have three .
I don &apos;t know why they gave me so much .
We had a bowl of pretzels positioned off to the side .
It &apos;s on the bottom right corner there .
That allowed us to watch participants &apos; consummatory behavior .
So we &apos;re just tracking how many pretzels participants eat .
Rich Player : Are those pretzels a trick ?
Poor Player : I don &apos;t know .
Rich Player : I love pretzels .
Rich Player : I have money for everything .
Poor Player : How much is that ?
Rich Player : You owe me 24 dollars .
You &apos;re going to lose all your money soon .
I &apos;ll buy it . I have so much money .
I have so much money , it takes me forever .
I &apos;m pretty much untouchable at this point .
And we just monitor how much people give .
I know it sounds like I &apos;m making a joke .
They &apos;re in studies . This is for them .
And we just monitored how much candy participants took .
So here &apos;s an example of how we did it .
He approaches as the red truck successfully stops .
It &apos;s not difficult to discern that there are differences .
We &apos;re at unprecedented levels of economic inequality .
Even people at the top experience these outcomes .
So what do we do ?
Thank you .
Jean-Baptiste Michel : The mathematics of history
So it turns out that mathematics is a very powerful language .
But I don &apos;t think that &apos;s right .
I want to show you a couple of examples why .
That &apos;s a powerful historical force .
Now it &apos;s just the way it is .
Language changes over time , and it &apos;s a powerful force .
So Erez and I wanted to know more about that .
&quot; Today I walk . Yesterday I walked . &quot;
But some verbs are irregular .
&quot; Yesterday I thought . &quot;
So what kind of historical mechanism can produce that ?
What &apos;s the origin of this ?
And so that explains this pattern that we &apos;ve seen before .
Thank you very much .
Olafur Eliasson : Playing with space and light
In the studio we do a lot of experiments .
I would consider the studio more like a laboratory .
I have occasional meetings with scientists .
So just keep looking . Don &apos;t mind me .
I don &apos;t necessarily think the film is so interesting .
Who decides what reality is ?
This is the Tate Modern in London .
The show was , in a sense , about that .
And my idea was to make the space tangible .
So look at this . Look at the girl .
&quot; Oh ! That was my foot there ! &quot;
How do we reconfigure it ?
&quot; What does it matter ? &quot;
Is art about that ?
And the water flows through the city with time .
And if I vote it makes a difference .
If I take a stand , it makes a difference . &quot;
The difference between thinking and doing .
Iceland , lower right corner , my favorite place .
These kinds of experiments , they filter into architectural models .
These are ongoing experiments .
It &apos;s made out of ice .
It &apos;s quite simple and fundamental .
I &apos;ve walked a lot in the mountains in Iceland .
It doesn &apos;t really tell you what you &apos;re looking at .
The big mountains far away , they move less .
The small mountains in the foreground , they move more .
And your body somehow knows that .
So this means a waterfall is a way of measuring space .
It was also about giving the city a sense of dimension .
And why would we want to do that ?
Is there a sense of consequences ?
One could say this is about community , collectivity .
It &apos;s about being together .
How do we create public space ?
What does the word &quot; public &quot; mean today anyway ?
It &apos;s very much about this causality , consequences .
So what is between thinking and doing ?
Experience is about responsibility .
Having an experience is taking part in the world .
Taking part in the world is really about sharing responsibility .
That &apos;s all I have . Thank you very much .
I want to start on a slightly somber note .
Should it be a mastectomy ? Should it be a lumpectomy ?
With all the side effects ?
Or should it be a less aggressive form of treatment ?
And these were being pressed upon us by the doctors .
I think that is too simplistic .
Which got me thinking .
Now , why do you have to consume the tea ?
Why ? Because it makes a lot of sense .
Simultaneously , it needs to be calm .
Not agitated , calm . For which chamomile is very good .
And you know that .
Now , you &apos;re all going to consume the tea .
Anyone in the audience want to take a stab ?
Baba Shiv : Whoa !
Okay , that &apos;s cool .
Because we want these puzzles to be difficult .
Now , here &apos;s another example .
Anyone ? It &apos;s much more difficult .
Yeah , wow . Okay .
So , yeah , so this is again difficult .
Less effort , you &apos;re less persistent , and so on .
How do you know that ?
Well we have two objective measures .
You will spend less time compared to you .
Right ? Second , it is negative .
Remember , the deck was stacked against you .
In terms of the difficulty level of these puzzles .
And this can happen in the medical domain .
Right ? It can happen in the stock market .
Volatile stock market , getting negative feedback that &apos;s also immediate .
And the feedback in all these cases is concrete .
You were responsible for your decision .
So what do you do ?
You focus on the foregone option .
Now , I started off on the somber note .
I want to finish up on a more upbeat note .
Thank you .
Avi Rubin : All your devices can be hacked
Now medical devices have come a long way technologically .
You can see in 1926 the first pacemaker was invented .
And why do I say that ?
They launched many , many successful attacks .
Now , wireless and the Internet can improve health care greatly .
Okay , let me shift gears and show you another target .
The modern car is a sophisticated multi-computer device .
And what happens if somebody wanted to attack this ?
Now , they have two areas they can attack .
They actually carried out their attack in real life .
You might produce a lot of speeding tickets .
They were able to disable the brakes .
All of these were implemented successfully .
How would you steal a car in this model ?
You use the GPS in the car to locate it .
Surveillance was really interesting .
Am I scaring you yet ?
I &apos;ve got a few more of these interesting ones .
I &apos;ll show you two more . One is P25 radios .
It &apos;s more of a two-way radio .
Could you run a denial-of-service , because these are first responders ?
You see the difference ?
This is plain text . This is encrypted .
And what kind of things were people talking about ?
It was mostly law enforcement and criminal .
That one &apos;s pretty easy to fix .
Now , we &apos;ve all looked at smartphones upside down .
And so they had a simple setup .
Don &apos;t waste computer cycles .
It &apos;s the Supreme Court , right ?
So they ran the Pac-Man game .
What does this all mean ?
Thank you very much .
Sarah Kay : If I should have a daughter ...
Believe me , I &apos;ve tried .
That there &apos;ll be days like this .
You will put the wind in winsome , lose some .
You will put the star in starting over , and over .
Your voice is small , but don &apos;t ever stop singing .
Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you .
Thanks .
Thank you .
The only rule is don &apos;t think too hard .
Okay , ready ? Go .
Okay .
So here are three things I know to be true .
Why was the scarecrow invited to TED ?
Because he was out standing in his field .
I &apos;m sorry .
But there are plenty of things I have trouble understanding .
So I write poems to figure things out .
Spoken word poetry is the art of performance poetry .
And I was underdeveloped and over-excitable .
So I decided to give it a try .
And lightning struck .
I was hooked .
Now I can divide my spoken word journey into three steps .
And that was thanks to a girl in a hoodie .
When I was in high school I had created Project V.O.I.C.E.
But it turns out sometimes , poetry can be really scary .
So I came up with lists . Everyone can write lists .
And then someone else has something the complete opposite of yours .
And most people respond really well to this exercise .
I don &apos;t have anything interesting to say . &quot;
But I try to walk through life like this .
I write musicals ; I make short films alongside my poems .
But I teach spoken word poetry because it &apos;s accessible .
Plus , spoken word poetry allows for immediate connections .
Because step three never ends .
I think December 54th was probably supposed to be 24th .
I think that we all did .
So I &apos;d like to close with this poem .
And what was left of the city soon followed .
She says I have old eyes .
My knees still buckle every time I get on a stage .
My parents named me Sarah , which is a biblical name .
I start quickly becoming part of your past .
But in that instant , I get to share your present .
And you , you get to share mine .
And that is the greatest present of all .
These aren &apos;t the last words I &apos;ll share .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Miru Kim : My underground art explorations
I wanted to dissect it and look into its unseen layers .
Most people ignore them or are frightened of them .
The MTA will confiscate your camera . &quot;
I &apos;ll follow the rats . &quot;
Simply documenting these soon-to-be-demolished structures wasn &apos;t enough for me .
The nature had really reclaimed the whole complex .
The construction began in 1837 .
It lasted about five years .
It got abandoned when the new Croton Aqueducts opened in 1890 .
This is a tunnel underneath Riverside Park .
It was built in the 1930s by Robert Moses .
Walking in this tunnel is very peaceful .
This is the same tunnel .
This is a tunnel that &apos;s abandoned in Hell &apos;s Kitchen .
I was basically intruding in his living space .
It must have been a very unusual day for him .
This is underneath my alma mater , Columbia University .
This is the actual catacombs in Paris .
The first tunnels date back to 60 B.C.
It &apos;s very dangerous to get lost in there .
This is a German bunker .
This is the Tower of Saint Jacques .
It was built in the early 1500s .
It was not very comfortable .
This was probably the toughest place to explore .
I &apos;ve become more interested in capturing movement and texture .
And the 16mm black-and-white film gave a different feel to it .
And this is the first theater project I worked on .
This was taken inside an archaeological tunnel in the main temple .
I like doing more than just exploring these spaces .
Thank you .
Ben Kacyra : Ancient wonders captured in 3D
I &apos;d like to start with a short story .
Let me show you how it works .
The point is then recorded into a 3D visualization program .
All of this happens in seconds .
They were gone in an instant .
And unfortunately , there was no detailed documentation of these Buddhas .
We called the project CyArk , which stands for Cyber Archive .
These would be used for education , cultural tourism , etc .
This happens to be the cloud of points for Tikal .
And so this is not a video .
This is actual 3D points with two to three millimeter accuracy .
Let me close with another short story .
Last March , we received very sad news .
The Royal Tombs had been destroyed by suspected arson .
Our answer , of course , was yes .
Let me leave you with a final thought .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
So you have been digitally preserved in about four minutes .
I &apos;d like to thank the wizards here .
David .
Let &apos;s give them a hand .
Thank you .
New thinking on the climate crisis
Perhaps we should say the same thing about optimism .
How dare we be optimistic ?
Optimism is sometimes characterized as a belief , an intellectual posture .
And we have one .
Let me show you these slides here .
This is what &apos;s happened in the last 28 years .
To put it in perspective , 2005 was the previous record .
That puts a lot of pressure on Greenland .
They have exactly the same amount of carbon .
It &apos;s not because Venus is slightly closer to the Sun .
Here &apos;s the stratosphere : cooler .
CSI : Climate .
What is missing is a sense of urgency .
This is the winner .
Fox : two . CNN : two . C zero .
So here &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
But it &apos;s not just the developed nations .
We have the technologies .
We need to do it for our own economy .
And it is based on an old model .
We now have a culture of distraction .
But we have a planetary emergency .
I wish I could find the words to convey this .
This was another hero generation that brought democracy to the planet .
We have the capacity to do it .
Let &apos;s do that . Thank you very much .
That hurts .
You have no idea .
Every single debate has been sponsored by &quot; Clean Coal . &quot;
&quot; Now , even lower emissions ! &quot;
This challenge is part of the fabric of our whole civilization .
CO2 is the exhaling breath of our civilization , literally .
Use the Internet . Go on the Internet .
Connect with people . Become very active as citizens .
We need help . We need help .
We can change things , but we have to actively change .
What &apos;s needed really is a higher level of consciousness .
So we have to have a change in consciousness .
A change in commitment . A new sense of urgency .
Al Gore , thank you so much for coming to TED .
AG : Thank you . Thank you very much .
Amy Cuddy : Your body language shapes who you are
So how many of you are sort of making yourselves smaller ?
Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this .
Sometimes we spread out .
I see you .
Even the BBC and The New York Times .
When we think about communication , we think about interactions .
So what is your body language communicating to me ?
What &apos;s mine communicating to you ?
And we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language .
If you use them poorly , bad idea . Right ?
So what nonverbals am I talking about ?
I became especially interested in nonverbal expressions of power and dominance .
And what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance ?
Well , this is what they are .
So in the animal kingdom , they are about expanding .
And humans do the same thing .
They do this .
So again , both animals and humans do the same thing .
We do the opposite of them .
When they sit down , they &apos;re sort of spread out .
They raise their hands like this .
I notice a couple of things about this .
One , you &apos;re not going to be surprised .
It seems to be related to gender .
So business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap .
There &apos;s some evidence that they do .
They also tend to be able to think more abstractly .
There are a lot of differences between powerful and powerless people .
So here &apos;s one .
A couple more .
Here are a couple more .
So you can be standing or you can be sitting .
And here are the low-power poses .
So you &apos;re folding up , you &apos;re making yourself small .
This one is very low-power .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experiment .
Here &apos;s what we find on testosterone .
So again , two minutes , and you get these changes .
Also , our bodies change our minds .
Again , this is not about you talking to other people .
So that &apos;s what we want to test . Okay ?
It &apos;s five minutes long . They are being recorded .
So this really spikes your cortisol .
We also evaluate these people much more positively overall . &quot;
No effect on those things . This is what &apos;s affected .
I don &apos;t want to feel like an impostor .
I was thrown out of a car , rolled several times .
They say , &quot; You &apos;re not going to finish college .
Eventually I graduated from college .
I am an impostor .
You are going to fake it .
And the second was , she is supposed to be here !
Like , she can fake it , she can become it .
So she had changed .
Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes .
So this is two minutes .
Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
Get your testosterone up . Get your cortisol down .
I don &apos;t have ego involved in this .
Thank you .
Lee Smolin : Science and democracy
So how does it work ?
And here are some of the ethical principles .
I &apos;m in entertain , amaze mode .
And I want to talk about three stages in that evolution .
And the idea is that everything is defined .
And they were very closely associated .
In fact , Newton and Locke were friends .
And let me show you .
This universe is described by being a network of relationships .
And this network of relations is ever-evolving .
So we call it a relational universe .
All properties of things are about these kinds of relationships .
So this is general relativity , this is quantum theory .
They &apos;re thinking about the same things .
So there &apos;s an interesting discussion going on there .
This last view of cosmology is called the relational view .
So in a relational universe we must have processes of self-organization .
That was the triumph of Neo-Darwinism and so forth .
Noel Bairey Merz : The single biggest health threat women face
So this is the leading killer of women .
Because the personal , as you know , is political .
And not enough is being done about this .
Since 1984 , more women die in the U.S. than men .
It &apos;s certainly what I learned when I was training .
So it &apos;s a woman &apos;s disease now .
So that was a big wake-up call in the 1980 &apos;s .
Heart disease kills more women at all ages than breast cancer .
Now sometimes when people see this , I hear this gasp .
I &apos;m going to tell you why .
Heart disease kills people , often very quickly .
Breast cancer , mortality is down to four percent .
And that is the 40 years that women have advocated .
And then physicians have gone to bat .
We &apos;ve done the research .
We have effective therapies now .
Women are living longer than ever .
It &apos;s not happening , and it &apos;s time .
We owe an incredible debt of gratitude to these two women .
And she wanted to study the Talmud .
And so how did she get educated then ?
She had to impersonate a man .
She had to look like a man .
Bernadine Healy , Dr. Healy , was a cardiologist .
Mortality is not going down , it &apos;s going up .
And here &apos;s what the story is .
And they &apos;re just passed .
And this is the biggest biomedical enterprise research in the world .
And it funds a lot of my research .
It funds research all over the place .
It was a very big deal for her to become director .
It told us about hormone replacement therapy .
It &apos;s informed us about osteoporosis .
It informed us about breast cancer , colon cancer in women .
And the under-reading was women aren &apos;t worth it .
Why are more and more women dying of ischemic heart disease ?
And our colleagues in Washington , D.C.
You &apos;re going to find some interesting analogies in this physiology .
So I &apos;ll describe the male-pattern heart attack first .
Hollywood heart attack . Ughhhh .
Horrible chest pain .
There &apos;s a big clot in the middle of the artery .
That &apos;s a man heart attack .
So what do you think happens to these gals ?
They &apos;re often not recognized , sent home .
Right here , it &apos;s just a focal -- right there .
Where do women get fat ?
All over .
Cellulite here , cellulite here .
Men just have to dump it in a single area . &quot;
So we said , &quot; Let &apos;s look at these . &quot;
And you can see , it &apos;s lumpy bumpy .
He &apos;s got a beer belly in his coronary arteries .
Panel B is the woman , very smooth .
She &apos;s just laid it down nice and tidy .
Kind of hard to see that female-pattern disease .
So that was a discovery .
Now what are the implications of that ?
Ideally you would love to do all this non-invasively .
So this is cardiac magnetic resonance imaging .
We selected this for the research .
And that is microvascular obstruction .
So we &apos;re very excited about M.R.
These are our life-saving treatments .
And those little red boxes are deaths .
So those are the consequences .
Why are there women and men ?
Because women bring new life into the world .
That &apos;s all stem cells .
These are female and male stem cells .
So this is not a zero-sum game in anyway .
Okay , so here &apos;s where we started .
What has happened in the last 15 years with this work ?
We are bending the curve .
We &apos;re bending the curve .
Now are we happy with this ?
We &apos;ve worked on this for 15 years .
So we &apos;re 35 years behind .
And in fact , it probably won &apos;t .
But we cannot stop now .
Too many lives are at stake .
So what do we need to do ?
The women are very good about getting mammograms now .
And women do fundraising .
Women participate .
This is what we need to do with heart disease now .
And it &apos;s political .
So we have these feast and famine cycles .
So thank you for your attention .
David Blaine : How I held my breath for 17 minutes
I lived there with nothing but water .
That one was way more difficult than I had expected .
So , next I went to London .
I would later find out that was Houdini &apos;s personal record .
He was underneath , not breathing for 45 minutes .
His core temperature had dropped to 77 degrees .
As a magician , I think everything is possible .
So , I met with a top neurosurgeon .
So , I took that as a challenge , basically .
So , I realized that was completely not going to work .
This is a little hard to watch .
But this is that attempt .
So , that clearly wasn &apos;t going to work .
Then I actually started thinking about liquid breathing .
There is a chemical that &apos;s called perflubron .
So , that idea disappeared .
Which was another insane idea , obviously .
So , I started researching into pearl divers .
There is many different aspects to free-diving .
And then there is static apnea .
That was the one that I studied .
And I learned how to slow my heart rate down .
And then I learned how to purge .
Purging is basically hyperventilating .
You blow in and out ...
You do that , you get lightheaded , you get tingling .
And you &apos;re really ridding your body of CO2 .
So , when you hold your breath it &apos;s infinitely easier .
I would repeat this process eight times in a row .
Out of 52 minutes you &apos;re only breathing for eight minutes .
You feel like you &apos;re walking around in a daze .
And you have these awful headaches .
I started learning about the world-record holder .
His name is Tom Sietas .
And this guy is perfectly built for holding his breath .
He &apos;s six foot four . He &apos;s 160 pounds .
I &apos;m six foot one , and fat .
We &apos;ll say big-boned .
I had to drop 50 pounds in three months .
I ate really small controlled portions throughout the day .
And I started to really adapt my body .
Which is lower than most Olympic athletes .
I wanted to try holding my breath everywhere .
I was completely wrong .
I entered the sphere a week before the scheduled air date .
And I thought everything seemed to be on track .
This was a critical mistake .
Because of the movement I was wasting oxygen .
And by seven minutes I had gone into these awful convulsions .
By 7 : 08 I started to black out .
I had failed on every level .
I realized that my real competition was the beaver .
So , I would sleep in a hypoxic tent every night .
So , it &apos;s like base camp Everest .
So , it was a pretty big success .
So , he pulled me up , and I was fine .
There was one person there that was definitely not impressed .
My brother had a picture of it . It is really ...
Then his main competitor went out and broke his record .
Which was three minutes longer than I had prepared .
You know , it was longer than the record .
I wanted to get them to do a piece on it .
So , I started full focus .
That made me extremely nervous , raising the heart rate .
And it was right next to the sphere .
Which was making me more nervous .
And there is no way to slow my heart rate down .
And I was getting more nervous .
It was a waste of O2 .
There was no way for me to do it .
So , I started to really get really paranoid .
Then at 13 minutes , maybe because of the hypochondria .
I started feeling pains all over my chest .
It was awful .
And I started having ischemia to the heart .
It would skip a beat .
And I didn &apos;t take my head out .
And then suddenly I hear screaming .
And I went to 17 minutes and four seconds .
I also didn &apos;t want anybody to question it .
I &apos;m like &quot; Yeah ? &quot;
I was like &quot; What ? &quot;
And that &apos;s my life . So ...
Hans Rosling : Religions and babies
I &apos;m going to talk about religion .
This is a very serious talk .
To what extent are these people right ?
This is a quiz . What do you think ?
Do you think it will decrease to one billion ?
I will tell you by the end of my speech .
But now , what does religion have to do with it ?
Each country &apos;s a bubble .
And the color now is the majority religion .
That &apos;s where we find Islamic majority .
So we were careful with that .
This is in 1960 .
And here the income per person in comparable dollars .
So low income here , high income there .
The exception was Japan .
Japan here was regarded as an exception .
Otherwise it was only Christian countries .
But they were in Latin America or they were in Africa .
And all the Eastern religions except Japan had the same level .
Now let &apos;s see what has happened in the world .
I start the world , and here we go .
Look at China . They &apos;re falling fairly fast .
It &apos;s a quite amazing development which has happened .
We get that from the census data .
It &apos;s not one of these statistics which is very doubtful .
It has happened across the world .
But there &apos;s no major difference .
There &apos;s no major difference between these religions .
There is a difference with income .
Most of them are in sub-Saharan Africa .
It &apos;s the other way around .
These countries have six children per woman .
Congo will go from 60 to 120 .
That &apos;s where we have the fast population growth .
Just look what they have done .
It &apos;s a tremendous improvement .
So what does it take ?
Well we know quite well what is needed in these countries .
You need to have children to survive .
You need to have access to some family planning .
But let me illustrate that fourth factor by looking at Qatar .
Look at Bangladesh and Qatar .
And what is the reason in Qatar ?
Well I do as I always do .
Very interesting . Lots to read .
I couldn &apos;t agree more . Science couldn &apos;t agree more .
Now look again at this .
There are countries up here which are very poor .
I strongly recommend Melinda Gates &apos; last TEDTalk .
We have reached peak child .
And the world population will stop growing .
Well I will show you here .
I will use these card boxes in which your notebooks came .
They are quite useful for educational purposes .
Each card box is one billion people .
And there are two billion children in the world .
There are two billion young people between 15 and 30 .
These are rounded numbers .
And then it &apos;s my box .
This is me : 60-plus .
We are here on top .
You can see that it &apos;s like three billion missing here .
So what will happen now is quite straightforward .
The old , sadly , we will die .
Then the old will die .
The rest will grow older and get two billion children .
This is the great fill-up .
It &apos;s inevitable .
That is needed .
Thank you very much .
Joel Levine : Why we need to go back to Mars
That &apos;s 300 million years per minute .
This is fly-by , Mariner IV .
It was taken in 1965 .
But let me start with a Viking photograph .
This is a composite taken by Viking in 1976 .
Viking was developed and managed at the NASA Langley Research Center .
This is a Viking Lander photograph of the surface of Mars .
And yes , the red planet is red .
We know a lot about Mars .
Very , very interesting planet .
This is 2,000 miles across .
This is Olympus Mons .
This is bigger than the state of Arizona .
We call this crustal magnetism .
Is there water on Mars ?
Today Mars is very very dry .
Here are some recent images .
This is from Spirit and Opportunity .
So , this is frozen water .
This is ice water on Mars .
It has not been seen publicly .
Very intriguing photograph .
Where did the ocean &apos;s worth of water on Mars go ?
Well , we have an idea .
So , there is a lot of water below the surface .
And you can see there are three distinct regions of methane .
Why is methane important ?
These are the three plumes : A , B1 , B2 .
The oldest rock on Earth is only 3.6 billion .
We have no geological record prior for the first billion years .
That record exists on Mars .
It was a Tuesday .
Here is Viking I , Viking II .
This is Opportunity . This is Spirit .
There aren &apos;t many craters .
But look in the southern hemisphere .
We asked this question 10 years ago .
It &apos;s an Aerial Regional-scale Environmental Surveyor .
There &apos;s a model of ARES here .
This is a 20-percent scale model .
This airplane was designed at the Langley Research Center .
We fly about a mile above the surface .
This is what ARES looks like as it flies over Mars .
We preprogram it .
We will fly where the methane is .
How do we transport an airplane to Mars ?
In two words , very carefully .
How do we get it to Mars ?
We fold it , and we transport it in a spacecraft .
And we have it in something called an aeroshell .
This is how we do it .
And we have a little video that describes the sequence .
Main engine start , and liftoff .
This is the spacecraft taking nine months to get to Mars .
It enters the atmosphere of Mars .
A parachute opens up to slow it down .
The thermal tiles fall off .
The airplane is exposed to the atmosphere for the first time .
It unfolds .
The rocket engine begins .
Practice makes perfect .
How do we know we can do it ?
We do our tests at 100,000 feet .
And I want to show you one of our tests .
This is a half-scale model .
This is a high-altitude helium balloon .
This is over Tilamook , Oregon .
We &apos;re ready to go .
I have a scale model here .
There &apos;s actually no honorarium for anyone for this thing .
Thank you very much .
Yann Arthus-Bertrand : A wide-angle view of fragile Earth
So what do I have to do ?
Alberta sand oil , a lot of pollution .
We know about the end of oil .
Oil sand is not a long-term solution .
We don &apos;t want to believe what we know .
Deny .
Coral reef in New Caledonia .
North Pole . I &apos;ve done this picture last summer .
It was impossible to do this picture 15 years ago .
Now there is a new way open between Atlantic and Pacific .
There is a new face of Kilimanjaro without ice .
Sad picture .
It lost 80 percent of its ice .
Glaciers are very important for the life on earth .
Return of fish men .
One fifth of human kind depend on fish to live .
Today now 70 percent of the fish stock are over-exploited .
We don &apos;t want to believe what we know .
The beautiful picture , by &#91; unclear &#93; in Africa .
One billion people have not enough to eat .
Palm tree plantation in Borneo .
Every year we lose 50 thousand square miles in deforestation .
Refugee camp in Darfur .
Today we have 20 million refugees in the world .
I always show my pictures in the street .
We have done already 100 exhibitions in the cities .
But how to understand the world without the voice of people ?
Landscape was not enough .
It was obvious to me to do another work .
I launched a project named Six Billion Others .
We have done five thousand interviews .
I &apos;m going to show you this .
The most beautiful thing that has happened to me in life ?
Love ? Love is nice if you can have it .
You &apos;re asking me a hard question .
Fourth I live happily because what else should I do ?
Fifth The first thing I remember ...
Eighth I had a big laugh today .
Ninth You see , family is ... it &apos;s awful .
10th In the word life , you have the life .
11th Who am I ? Isn &apos;t that the biggest question ?
I feel ashamed .
And I feel humbled by their strength .
Second Dad , Mom , I grew up .
My family ... What can I say ?
Thank you .
I still surf . I sail the world . I freedive .
After many people said I couldn &apos;t do that .
I got the easy part .
14th Let &apos;s say that you and me like each other .
You come from elsewhere .
You don &apos;t know me . I don &apos;t know you .
We talk without lying .
How can we make it all by ourselves ?
Forty crucial questions .
Now I am going to speak to you about my movie .
It is about the state of the planet .
It &apos;s a fantastic story of life on the earth .
I &apos;m very proud to show you the teaser .
This Earth is four and a half billion years old .
These plants , several hundred million years old .
Our life is tied to the well-being of our planet .
We depend on water , forests , deserts , oceans .
And yet we carry on raising walls to keep us apart .
Half of the world &apos;s forests have vanished .
Water resources are running low .
Intensive farming is depleting soils .
Our energy sources are not sustainable .
The climate is changing .
We are endangering ourselves .
We &apos;re only trying to improve our lives .
But the wealth gaps are growing wider .
We know that solutions are available today .
So what are we waiting for ?
Y Luc Besson is the producer of the movie .
But it is not a normal movie .
The film is going to be distributed free .
This film has no copyright .
There is no business on this movie .
We have to believe what we know .
Let me tell you something .
It &apos;s too late to be pessimistic -- really too late .
We have all a part of the solutions .
Merci beaucoup . I love you .
Benjamin Zander : The transformative power of classical music
And one of them wrote , &quot; Situation hopeless . Stop .
They don &apos;t wear shoes . &quot;
And the other one wrote , &quot; Glorious opportunity .
They don &apos;t have any shoes yet . &quot;
Maybe you have this child at home .
He sounds something like this .
I see some of you recognize this child .
At that point , they usually give up .
What actually happened was the impulses were reduced .
And the second , with an impulse every other note .
You can see it by looking at my head .
The nine-year-old put an impulse on every four notes .
And the 10-year-old , on every eight notes .
And the 11-year-old , one impulse on the whole phrase .
It can be the other buttock .
He was the president of a corporation in Ohio .
You should be a one-buttock player . &quot;
And suddenly , the music took off . It took flight .
And then I got a letter from this gentleman .
He said , &quot; I was so moved .
There are 1,600 people , I believe .
And your children are playing instruments .
You can &apos;t imagine your life without classical music .
Then there &apos;s another group , bigger group .
These are the people who don &apos;t mind classical music .
A little Vivaldi in the background doesn &apos;t do any harm .
That &apos;s the second group .
Now comes the third group .
These are the people who never listen to classical music .
It &apos;s just simply not part of your life .
That &apos;s probably the largest group of all .
And then there &apos;s a very small group .
These are the people who think they &apos;re tone-deaf .
Amazing number of people think they &apos;re tone-deaf .
Actually , you cannot be tone-deaf . Nobody is tone-deaf .
You have a fantastic ear . Everybody has a fantastic ear .
So nobody is tone-deaf .
The tone-deaf people , they &apos;re no longer here .
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
Do you know what I think probably happened in this room ?
So let &apos;s see what &apos;s really going on here .
Let &apos;s try it again . Ooh , the TED choir .
And you notice nobody is tone-deaf , right ? Nobody is .
Or they say , &quot; Hamlet has an Oedipus complex . &quot;
No , otherwise the play would be over , stupid .
So he does it again .
And then finally ...
So this is a piece which goes from away to home .
And finally goes to E , and it &apos;s home .
And what you &apos;re going to see is one-buttock playing .
What was he thinking about ? Lunch ?
I was clapping . They were clapping .
Finally , I said , &quot; Why am I clapping ? &quot;
Now that is something .
But I tell you what happened to me .
And I felt the tears streaming down my face .
They say three percent of the population likes classical music .
How would you talk ? How would you be ?
See , these are totally different worlds .
The conductor of an orchestra doesn &apos;t make a sound .
I realized my job was to awaken possibility in other people .
You could light up a village with this guy &apos;s eyes .
We can do that with our children , too .
That &apos;s a totally different world .
And you know , I have a definition of success .
It &apos;s about how many shining eyes I have around me .
Shining eyes , shining eyes .
Thank you , thank you .
Charles Leadbeater : Education innovation in the slums
It &apos;s a great pleasure to be here .
I think CERN is the home of the Large Hadron Collider .
What ever happened to the Small Hadron Collider ?
Where is the Small Hadron Collider ?
Because the Small Hadron Collider once was the big thing .
The whole Hadron Collider family needs unlocking .
And they have absolutely amazing education systems .
So I ended up in places like this .
This is a place called Monkey Hill .
It &apos;s one of the hundreds of favelas in Rio .
Almost all of that growth will be in the developed world .
This is a guy called Juanderson .
It was boring .
He was turning over 200,000 dollars a week .
He employed 200 people .
He was going to be dead by the age of 25 .
Or you can go to places like this .
Millions of people living here , stretched over many kilometers .
They just finished their Kenyan certificate of secondary education .
So there are schools in slums like this .
They &apos;re places like this .
That &apos;s where Maureen went to school .
And the education they got was pitiful .
It &apos;s not to do with electricity or water .
It &apos;s the mobile phone .
Or you could go to places like this .
Ten years ago , they certainly would have been married .
This is a private school .
This is a fee-pay school . This is a good school .
The reason they went on studying was this .
Those girls have never touched Google .
They know nothing about Wikipedia .
What do they look like ?
Well , education is a global religion .
You can go to places like this .
This is a school three hours outside of Sao Paulo .
Most of the children there have parents who are illiterate .
Many of them don &apos;t have electricity at home .
Most of our education system is push .
I was literally pushed to school .
That isn &apos;t really going to attract him .
You need to pull him .
And so education needs to work by pull , not push .
What does that ?
That &apos;s too long if you &apos;re poor .
And you also need to make it intrinsically interesting .
So time and again , I found people like this .
These things , they teach through .
Taio Rocha uses making soap as a technology of learning .
Masses of peer learning .
Well , you create your own teachers .
Pune has 5,000 building sites .
It has 30,000 children on those building sites .
That &apos;s one city .
So I met this character , Steven .
Here , there isn &apos;t really an option .
It &apos;s the largest NGO in education in the world .
And it also supports working-class kids going into Indian schools .
He &apos;s a complete revolutionary .
You should turn it into McDonald &apos;s .
And it &apos;s the same wherever you go .
It &apos;s reliable and people know exactly where they are .
And there will be no mistakes . &quot;
Yet , everyone knows what is a Chinese restaurant .
You know a Chinese restaurant when you see it .
The McDonald &apos;s model scales .
The Chinese restaurant model spreads .
So mass education started with social entrepreneurship in the 19th century .
And what can we learn from all of that ?
They fail to reach the people they most need to serve .
They often hit their target but miss the point .
There are two basic types of innovation .
So that &apos;s why we need three more kinds of innovation .
We need more reinvention .
They &apos;re recognizably schools , but they look different .
There are Big Picture schools in the U.S. and Australia .
There are Kunskapsskolan schools in Sweden .
Most of them are in other buildings not designed as schools .
There is an amazing school in Northen Queensland called Jaringan .
So we certainly need more of that .
You need efforts to supplement schools .
We need more of that completely new and radical thinking .
It &apos;s an amazing thing .
It &apos;s recognizably 19th century in its roots .
And of course it &apos;s a huge achievement .
And of course it will bring great things .
It will bring skills and learning and reading .
But it will also lay waste to imagination .
It will stratify society as much as it liberates it .
Thank you .
Dean Kamen : Luke , a new prosthetic arm for soldiers
Whole arm . Shoulder disarticulation .
And they deserve more than that . &quot;
You know , had efferent , afferent , and haptic response .
And it can &apos;t be done .
You think it &apos;s bad to lose one arm ?
I keep thinking about these kids with no arms .
We &apos;ve got some pretty amazing neurology and other people . &quot;
We put this thing together .
We showed it to a bunch of guys .
These kids have attitudes that you just can &apos;t believe .
Watch the fingers grab . The thumb comes up . Wrist .
This weighs 6.9 pounds .
Going to scratch his nose .
It &apos;s got 14 active degrees of freedom .
They don &apos;t give any instructions .
Ants interact using smell .
So in this environment , interactions are used to activate foraging .
The system works to stay stopped , unless something positive happens .
So interactions function to activate foragers .
And we &apos;ve been studying the evolution of this system .
First of all , there &apos;s variation .
It turns out that colonies are different .
And this raises an analogous question about brains .
She &apos;s a matriarch .
She &apos;s one of the rare great-grandmothers on the site .
And guess what we call this analogy ?
The anternet is coming .
So what happens when operating costs are low ?
So here &apos;s an example of ant security .
So the invasive Argentine ant makes expandable search networks .
We &apos;re still analyzing the data .
I don &apos;t have the results yet .
It &apos;s very simple .
It can be done with cheap materials .
There are many different kinds of cancer .
We have a lot to learn from them .
Thank you .
John Hockenberry : We are all designers
I am no designer , nope , no way .
It &apos;s letting stuff happen without thinking about it .
Every object should be about something , John .
It should imagine a user .
That &apos;s what he said .
Dad helped design the control panels for the IBM 360 computer .
And design was in everything my dad did .
We had lots of old jazz records lying around the house .
You gotta make it your own . You gotta design it .
Show everyone what you intend , &quot; is what he said .
It &apos;s where we all belong . &quot;
All of us ? Designers ?
Oh , oh , Dad . Oh , Dad .
The song is just a given .
It &apos;s how you cover it that matters .
The original tune ? It &apos;s a little scary .
&quot; Ooh , what happened to that dude ?
He can &apos;t walk . Anybody know the story ?
Anybody ? &quot;
I roll swiftly through an airport , right ?
Or I &apos;d dress up really , really sharply or something .
Look at that !
I guess they &apos;re for safety , right ? &quot;
No ! They &apos;re not for safety .
No , no , no , no , no .
The difference is intent .
Intent changes the picture completely .
Acting with intent .
It conveys authorship .
It suggests that someone is driving .
It &apos;s reassuring ; people are drawn to it .
Someone making the experience their own .
Covering the tragic tune with something different , something radically different .
People respond to that .
It &apos;s a completely different domain .
As an intentional murderer , Anders Breivik is merely evil .
He &apos;s the breath of some primitive , ancient chaos .
He &apos;s the random state of nature we emerged from .
He &apos;s something very , very different .
It &apos;s as though intent is an essential component for humanity .
It &apos;s what we &apos;re supposed to do somehow .
We &apos;re supposed to act with intent .
We &apos;re supposed to do things by design .
Intent is a marker for civilization .
I met the dude . He &apos;s a great guy .
&quot; John , John , I looked at your chart .
Well !
What a liberating thought ! Yes !
I wasn &apos;t exactly a form of birth control .
Look at that font there . My wife was so pissed .
I mean , did a designer come up with that ?
In fact , maybe that &apos;s the problem .
And so , little Ajax was born .
It &apos;s something like my accident , right ?
He came out of nowhere .
We &apos;re five now . Five .
Facing the given with intent . Doing things by design .
We &apos;re really hoping he thanks us for that later on .
Man , I love that thing .
I could afford that .
Well , got that wrong , didn &apos;t we ?
What was going on then ?
All of a sudden , human existence needed an intent .
Human life needed a reason .
Reality itself needed a designer .
Gods we &apos;re still fighting about . Oh yeah .
Today we don &apos;t confront the chaos of nature .
What shall we do ?
The consequences of a planet with 7 billion people and counting .
And we can &apos;t just imitate the past . No .
That won &apos;t do .
That won &apos;t do at all .
There was rioting in the middle of Kinshasa .
People were carrying off vehicles , carrying off pieces of buildings .
He goes , &quot; Hey , mister ! Mister ! &quot;
I wish I could show you that contraption .
His machine : homemade , bolted , rusty , comical .
My machine : American-made , confident , sleek .
He would have loved those ! Oh yeah .
Design blew it all away for a moment .
And I pose this question .
You &apos;ll never walk again . &quot;
&quot; Nurse ! Is this the 28th or the 29th ? &quot;
And I went , &quot; Oh my God .
I &apos;ve got some catching up to do ! &quot;
Show everybody what you intend . &quot;
Daddy , this one &apos;s for you .
Charmian Gooch : Meet global corruption &apos;s hidden players
There &apos;s the former Soviet megalomaniacs .
Saparmurat Niyazov , he was one of them .
Now , he really loved to issue presidential decrees .
He was a slightly unusual guy .
There &apos;s Teodorín Obiang .
I &apos;ve been up to its front gates .
I can tell you it &apos;s a magnificent spread .
And there &apos;s Dan Etete .
But does it just happen over there ?
Well , at 22 , I was very lucky .
And that &apos;s how my relationship with corruption really began .
Well , some of that sprang from our work .
And it was a slightly crazy place .
But it wasn &apos;t about blood diamonds .
He did business with global banks .
He used shell companies .
And then there &apos;s Dan Etete .
Now let &apos;s take the banks first .
For example , in Sarawak , Malaysia .
So how did that happen ?
And then there &apos;s the problem of anonymous shell companies .
And how about the oil , gas and mining companies ?
Corruption in that sector , no surprise .
There &apos;s corruption everywhere , so why focus on that sector ?
Well , because there &apos;s a lot at stake .
Now , on the surface , the deal appeared straightforward .
And here &apos;s the thing .
I mean , these are state assets .
It &apos;s just how some business is done .
It &apos;s too complex and difficult to change .
So in effect , what ? We just accept it .
So this is change happening .
This is progress .
But we &apos;re not there yet , by far .
Thank you .
Kwabena Boahen : A computer that works like the brain
And I was fascinated .
But nobody was really worried about this .
Let &apos;s take a look at some numbers .
This is Blue Gene , the fastest computer in the world .
It would really boost the economy .
That &apos;s how much power this computer uses .
Now , let &apos;s compare this with the brain .
Rory is a graduate student at Stanford .
So that &apos;s true love , right there .
Now , how much computation does the brain do ?
How is the brain able to do this ?
It shows you these cells that process information .
They are called neurons .
That process is called a synapse .
How does that compare with the way computers work ?
The net is doing the work in the brain .
Information processing is very dynamic and adaptive .
Brian actually said this in 1995 .
The devices that computers use are what &apos;s called a transistor .
And this is a little protein molecule .
I mean , neurons have thousands of these .
Now , this pore can open and close .
you get some current sometimes .
Now , this is starting to happen in transistors .
That &apos;s the red path that &apos;s highlighted .
What you see here is that there &apos;s these redundant connections .
It makes the brain inherently robust .
Here is actually what our artificial eye looks like .
The retina chip that we designed sits behind this lens here .
The retina chip extracts four different kinds of information .
And then it also extracts movement .
And so , here you go .
Yes , so that &apos;s the idea .
Thank you .
Question for you , Kwabena .
It was very brute force ; it was very inelegant .
Thanks Kwabena , that was really interesting .
Thank you .
David Griffin : How photography connects us
Let &apos;s just start by looking at some great photographs .
Oh , the wrath of Photoshop .
He mounted a camera on the tail .
Pygmies in the DRC , by Randy Olson .
A polar bear swimming in the Arctic , by Paul Nicklen .
But , hey , at least it &apos;s hygienic .
And this is a comet , captured by Dr. Euan Mason .
Here &apos;s an example .
I can see the rocks are over here .
There &apos;s a wave about to crash onto him .
I got him . The wave broke over us .
We got back on shore ; he was fine .
We were a little bit rattled .
I thought I was a hero .
You need to know how to tell a story .
And that is what Nick did , up to a point .
This is a serval cat .
These are baboons at a watering hole .
And a crocodile walks up a riverbank toward its den .
But the centerpiece species of Zakouma are the elephants .
It was with the elephants that this story pivoted .
They named her Annie , and they began tracking her movements .
And that &apos;s when they ran into trouble .
And they only came for the ivory .
This is actually one of the rangers .
And instead , created a story that touched our audiences deeply .
Now let &apos;s go over to India .
Sometimes you can tell a broad story in a focused way .
And he did it in a beautiful way .
And here in China , Randy shot a jellyfish market .
This is called fishing down the food chain .
We also want to look for solutions .
Jim started in the battlefield .
Here is in the field hospital .
You know of &quot; The March of the Penguins . &quot;
This is sort of the munch of the penguins .
And then everybody kind of runs out and goes out .
But then Paul got in the water .
And he said he was never really afraid of this .
Well , this one female came up to him .
So , she is pretty significant in size .
Then Paul thinks that she simply took pity on him .
She dropped them off , and then they would swim away .
Which just resulted in a fantastic photograph .
Thank you .
Paul Debevec : Animating a photo-real digital face
They are very important to how we communicate with each other .
And that &apos;s actually a completely computer-generated rendering of her face .
We shoot all of these photographs in about three seconds .
Her muscles bulging in her forehead when she winces like that .
We &apos;re just seeing the coarse-scale geometry here .
These are the displacement maps here .
So the next process was then to animate her .
Emily : Image Metrics is a markerless , performance-driven animation company .
We specialize in high-quality facial animation for video games and films .
Image Metrics is a markerless , performance-driven animation company .
Here is the specular component animating .
You can see all the wrinkles happening there .
And there is the underlying wireframe mesh .
And that is Emily herself .
Now , where are we going with this here ?
And thank you very much .
Gavin Pretor-Pinney : Cloudy with a chance of joy
Clouds .
Have you ever noticed how much people moan about them ?
They get a bad rap .
I saw an article the other day .
It was about problems with computer processing over the Internet .
&quot; A cloud over the cloud , &quot; was the headline .
It seems like they &apos;re everyone &apos;s default doom-and-gloom metaphor .
But I think they &apos;re beautiful , don &apos;t you ?
You know , when you were masters of daydreaming ?
I think we should perhaps do a bit more of it .
Let &apos;s say you &apos;re in love . All right ?
And you look up and what do you see ?
Right ? Or maybe the opposite .
Perhaps you &apos;re having a moment of existential angst .
You know , you &apos;re thinking about your own mortality .
Or maybe you see a topless sunbather .
What would that mean ?
What would that mean ? I have no idea .
And these winds up there can be very , very fierce .
It &apos;s like a bit of everyday meditation .
Those are common clouds .
These clouds form in the region of mountains .
A little rarer are the fallstreak holes . All right ?
Rarer still , the Kelvin – Helmholtz cloud .
Not a very snappy name . Needs a rebrand .
And you &apos;ll see them around where you live .
It &apos;s what &apos;s produces thunder and lightning and hail .
They are an expression of the majestic architecture of our atmosphere .
Right ? It forms on a sunny day .
And cloudspotting legitimizes doing nothing .
It &apos;s good for your soul .
Thank you very much .
Ken Jennings : Watson , Jeopardy and me , the obsolete know-it-all
I mean , nine years is a long time .
But not all , a few are still alive .
Occasionally I still get recognized at the mall or whatever .
And I can &apos;t complain about this .
And I loved game shows , fascinated with game shows .
I was going to miss my game shows .
I was always that kind of obsessed trivia kid .
You know some Beatles factoid that Dad didn &apos;t know .
And so I sold out way too young .
But that &apos;s what I was doing .
This was the first I &apos;d heard of it .
And of course I said yes , for several reasons .
One , because playing &quot; Jeopardy &quot; is a great time .
And I would do it for nothing .
I just love &quot; Jeopardy , &quot; and I always have .
I was not going to say no .
I had taken some artificial intelligence classes .
And at first , it was very low .
But then you see the line start to go up .
And thought , what are these ?
And I saw this line coming for me .
And I realized , this is it .
Watson does not travel .
Watson &apos;s actually huge .
We got to walk through his climate-controlled server room .
And so Watson does not travel .
You must come to it ; you must make the pilgrimage .
But they were right . They were exactly right .
It had a robot thumb that was clicking on the buzzer .
And I remember thinking , this is it .
I felt obsolete .
And it hasn &apos;t been the last .
You don &apos;t need human assistants for that anymore .
I &apos;m not an economist myself .
And it was friggin &apos; demoralizing . It was terrible .
We &apos;re just obeying a little talking voice on our dashboard .
The things we know are still important .
There &apos;s so much information out there .
There &apos;s just too much .
It &apos;s doubling every 18 months now .
Who do I vote for ?
Do I take this job or that one ?
Quite probably not .
And you &apos;ll make a less informed decision .
But in this case it happened in real life .
And it happens in real life all the time .
That &apos;s often the advantage of time .
Oh , yeah . Roger Maris was from Fargo . &quot;
That doesn &apos;t work . That &apos;s just annoying .
Those movies are never about beautiful utopias .
Things always go terribly wrong .
And we can all make that choice .
I don &apos;t have to learn new things anymore . &quot;
We should have this unquenchable curiosity for the world around us .
I &apos;ve met a lot of them .
We can live in one of these two worlds .
Ladies and gentlemen , the choice is yours .
Thank you very much .
Feisal Abdul Rauf : Lose your ego , find your compassion
The truth of the matter is otherwise .
How can we go to a greater battle ? &quot;
The voice says , &quot; Go away . &quot;
With much greater humility , he knocks again on the door .
The voice asks , &quot; Who is there ? &quot;
He said , &quot; It is you , O heartbreaker . &quot;
And Rumi &apos;s stories are metaphors for the spiritual path .
But don &apos;t ignore what you &apos;ve asked them to do .
Compassion on earth is given , it is in us .
This is all you . And this is all us .
We know it all .
We have access to it all .
Jung may have called it &quot; the subconscious . &quot;
The language differs , but the objective is the same .
What is the imagery of God ?
Thank you , and God bless you .
Sherry Turkle : Connected , but alone ?
Her text said , &quot; Mom , you will rock . &quot;
I love this .
Getting that text was like getting a hug .
And so there you have it .
I embody the central paradox .
We were exploring different aspects of ourselves .
And then we unplugged .
I was excited .
Now fast-forward to 2012 .
I &apos;m back here on the TED stage again .
My daughter &apos;s 20 . She &apos;s a college student .
She sleeps with her cellphone , so do I.
So what happened ?
But then these same children deny each other their full attention .
And we even text at funerals .
I study this .
Why does this matter ?
People want to customize their lives .
And some people think that &apos;s a good thing .
I &apos;m the one who doesn &apos;t want to be interrupted .
So that &apos;s the bottom line .
And we clean them up with technology .
We short-change ourselves .
My answer was no , they don &apos;t add up .
It seemed to be looking in her eyes .
It seemed to be following the conversation .
It comforted her .
And many people found this amazing .
That robot put on a great show .
And we &apos;re vulnerable .
People experience pretend empathy as though it were the real thing .
It doesn &apos;t face death .
It doesn &apos;t know life . &quot;
We expect more from technology and less from each other .
And we are vulnerable .
We &apos;re lonely , but we &apos;re afraid of intimacy .
But we &apos;re not so comfortable .
We are not so much in control .
Being alone feels like a problem that needs to be solved .
And so people try to solve it by connecting .
It &apos;s shaping a new way of being .
We almost don &apos;t feel ourselves .
So what do we do ? We connect more and more .
How do you get from connection to isolation ?
We &apos;re smitten with technology .
But it &apos;s time to talk .
But it &apos;s not , it &apos;s early days .
I see some first steps .
Start thinking of solitude as a good thing .
Make room for it .
Find ways to demonstrate this as a value to your children .
Do the same thing at work .
Change that .
I &apos;m optimistic .
We have everything we need to start .
We have each other .
It &apos;s like calling in the cavalry .
But our fantasies of substitution have cost us .
They need us .
Thank you .
John McWhorter : Txtng is killing language . JK ! ! !
We always hear that texting is a scourge .
What do I mean by that ?
That &apos;s what we &apos;re probably genetically specified for .
That &apos;s how we use language most .
That &apos;s how much of a latterly thing writing is .
Now don &apos;t get me wrong , writing has certain advantages .
Casual speech is something quite different .
That &apos;s what speech is like .
Speech is much looser . It &apos;s much more telegraphic .
It &apos;s much less reflective -- very different from writing .
The Gettysburg Address was not the main meal of that event .
Ordinary people stood and listened to that for two hours .
It was perfectly natural .
That &apos;s what people did then , speaking like writing .
And that &apos;s where texting comes in .
And so , texting is very loose in its structure .
Now we can write the way we talk .
It &apos;s a very natural sense .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing in this fingered speech .
It &apos;s evolved into something that is much subtler .
&quot; I love the font you &apos;re using , btw . &quot;
No one &apos;s laughing .
Susan : &quot; lol , I see it . &quot;
Very funny people , if that &apos;s what LOL means .
This Julie says , &quot; So what &apos;s up ? &quot;
She &apos;s not amused . Let &apos;s think about it .
LOL is being used in a very particular way .
We linguists call things like that pragmatic particles .
Any spoken language that &apos;s used by real people has them .
A pragmatic particle , that &apos;s what LOL has gradually become .
It &apos;s a way of using the language between actual people .
Another example is &quot; slash . &quot;
That &apos;s kind of like what we &apos;re at .
It &apos;s used to change the scene .
Sally : &quot; For this summer program at NYU . &quot;
The slash is interesting .
You don &apos;t just zip right into it .
Texting has developed one from this slash .
There &apos;s a lack of structure of some sort .
It &apos;s the President of Harvard . It &apos;s 1871 .
There &apos;s no electricity . People have three names .
You can go even further back .
Increasing evidence is that being bilingual is cognitively beneficial .
That &apos;s also true of being bidialectal .
It &apos;s very simple .
That &apos;d be the second thing .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Yves Behar : A supercharged motorcycle design
Yves Behar : And in scenic Switzerland for me .
FN : I always had a passion for alternative vehicles .
This is a land yacht racing across the desert in Nevada .
YB : Combination of windsurfing and skiing into this invention there .
FN : And I also had an interest in dangerous inventions .
We had a lot that got us excited .
So we decided to do a special project together .
To combine engineering and design and ...
FN : Really make a fully integrated product , something beautiful .
YB : And we made a baby .
FN : Can you bring out our baby ?
This baby is fully electric .
It goes 150 miles an hour .
It &apos;s twice the range of any electric motorcycle .
It &apos;s got an amazing user experience .
It was wonderful working with Yves Behar .
YB : Thank you .
Ron McCallum : How technology allowed me to read
I love stories . I want to read . &quot;
But let me tell you a bit about it today .
I don &apos;t know where Julian Morrow got that from .
Look for it . Have you noticed it ?
I do . I look for it all the time .
And it brought me into contact with volunteers and helpers .
Students , family and friends all read me material .
But I thank you here , Lois , from this platform .
How very wrong I was .
See it up there ?
It &apos;s a blind computer .
I think there &apos;s more memory in my watch .
It had a speech synthesizer .
I didn &apos;t have to be nice to people !
I no longer would be censored .
That &apos;s what it &apos;s shrunk to .
I can keep up with my friends .
One is another American inventor Ted Henter .
Ron McCallum : Isn &apos;t that slow ?
I slowed it down for you .
Can we play that one ?
Do you love being read to ?
Isn &apos;t that a great book ?
I still love being close to someone reading to me .
There are other barriers brought about by our laws .
But those books can &apos;t travel across borders .
In Argentina , there are 50,000 .
And remember I was telling you about Harry Potter .
I want that to happen .
I &apos;ve indeed been a very fortunate human being .
I wonder what the future will hold .
I want to thank her too .
I think I have to say goodbye now .
Bless you . Thank you very much .
Yay !
Okay . Okay . Okay . Okay . Okay .
Nicholas Christakis : How social networks predict epidemics
And this spreads on out endlessly into a distance .
And you get a network that looks like this .
Every dot is a person .
And eventually , you saturate the population .
But things don &apos;t just diffuse in human populations at random .
They actually diffuse through networks .
You might see that people occupy different locations within the network .
And there are different kinds of relationships between the people .
And different sorts of things spread across different sorts of ties .
For instance , sexually transmitted diseases will spread across sexual ties .
But not all positions in the network are the same .
But in addition , there &apos;s something else .
Nicholas Christakis : B , it &apos;s obvious .
B is located on the edge of the network .
And that happens at every peripheral node .
Exactly what we predicted happened .
So the random group is in the red line .
And the difference in the two is 16 days .
I should say that depends on a host of factors .
So bigger dots mean more of your friends have the flu .
Here we are on October the 19th .
It cannot be because of some broadcast mechanism affecting everyone uniformly .
They are surrounded by immunized people .
So 96 percent is as good as 100 percent .
Would you get any population-level immunity ?
And the answer is no .
Or , frankly , for advertising with all kinds of products .
Just text us your temperature . &quot;
Thank you .
We &apos;re not talking each other . We &apos;re facing forward .
We &apos;re moving .
When the person in front of me slows down .
We &apos;re going to do working memory today .
You &apos;re going it right now .
It &apos;s not something we can turn off .
So right now , you &apos;re doing just fine .
Now working memory has four basic components .
People with high working memory capacity tend to be good storytellers .
They &apos;re able to have high levels of writing ability .
They &apos;re also able to reason at high levels .
You up for that ? Okay .
Don &apos;t write them down . Just hang on to them .
Five words .
I want to see what happens with those words .
So far so good ?
Just shout it out .
In fact it &apos;s -- -- exactly .
You should have started with Z.
Some people can hang on to five .
Some people can hang on to 10 .
Some will be down to two or three .
Now don &apos;t get me wrong , working memory is awesome .
It allows us to make sense of the world around us .
But it does have certain limits .
Now working memory is great for allowing us to communicate .
It allows us to problem-solve , critical think .
All of that occurs within working memory .
Gotta make sure we &apos;re getting what we &apos;re looking for .
We tend to remember about four things .
You do know the solution to that , right ?
You go back to that original room .
Have you ever forgotten your keys ?
You ever forgotten your car ?
You ever forgotten your kids ?
We negotiate that through strategies .
What &apos;s missing ? What would I like to know ?
Do I agree with the assumptions ?
How can I apply this in my life ?
So we need to think about it here .
In between , we want to talk to people about it .
Practice for some reason became a very negative thing .
It &apos;s very positive .
What we want to do is spin that around .
We need to take advantage of that .
Think about things in images , write things down that way .
If you read a book , pull things up .
The last one is organization and support .
We are meaning-making machines . It &apos;s what we do .
And the last one is support .
We all started as novices .
Everything we do is an approximation of sophistication .
Live life . Thank you .
Jonathan Haidt : The moral roots of liberals and conservatives
Suppose that two American friends are traveling together in Italy .
We all know that it &apos;s Bill .
And in this case , the stereotype corresponds to reality .
You can understand why artists are so different from accountants .
This trait also tells us a lot about politics .
This is from some guy named Ted .
Let &apos;s find out .
Please raise your hand high right now . OK .
Please raise your hand if you &apos;d say you &apos;re libertarian .
OK , about a -- two dozen .
OK . This is a bit of a problem .
But I &apos;m here today to give you a choice .
So anyway , let &apos;s go with the red pill .
Let &apos;s start at the beginning .
What is morality and where does it come from ?
Nature provides a first draft , which experience then revises .
That you find across cultures and even across species ?
The first one is harm / care .
It gives us very strong feelings about those who cause harm .
The second foundation is fairness / reciprocity .
The third foundation is in-group / loyalty .
Sports is to war as pornography is to sex .
We get to exercise some ancient , ancient drives .
The fourth foundation is authority / respect .
The fifth foundation is purity / sanctity .
Here are the results .
Here are the results from about 23,000 American citizens .
Same story for fairness .
But look at the other three lines .
For liberals , the scores are very low .
But as people get more conservative , the values rise .
Conservatives have more of a five-foundation , or five-channel morality .
We find this in every country we look at .
Here &apos;s the data for 1,100 Canadians .
I &apos;ll just flip through a few other slides .
Because liberals like to say , &quot; Fetch , please . &quot;
But if you &apos;re conservative , that &apos;s not so attractive .
What makes them moral ?
In the first panel , we see the moment of creation .
Some of you might recognize this as the &apos; 60s .
Of course , Bosch called this hell .
The truth of social entropy .
It shoots up and it keeps going up .
It really helps to have some sort of punishment .
The Grand Canyon is really simple .
It &apos;s not that complicated .
How did this happen ?
Because liberals reject three of these foundations .
They say , &quot; Let &apos;s question authority . &quot;
Liberals have very noble motives for doing this .
So liberals speak for the weak and oppressed .
This was after the chaos of the French Revolution .
Think about yin and yang .
You find the same thing in Hinduism .
There are many high gods in Hinduism .
You find the same thing in Buddhism .
Can you be not for or against anything ?
So , what &apos;s the point ? What should you do ?
No , absolutely not . I &apos;m not saying that .
Step out .
Think about the Dalai Lama .
But there is also a passionate commitment to the truth .
Thank you .
Suzana Herculano-Houzel : What is so special about the human brain ?
What is so special about the human brain ?
But let &apos;s play along .
It seems quite vexing .
It must be really extraordinary , an exception to the rule .
Our brain is three times larger than a gorilla brain .
And this is where the story started to bother me .
But nobody did .
Well , what about our brain then ?
But just as important is what the 86 billion neurons mean .
That &apos;s not possible .
I don &apos;t think it looks like us .
The human brain is not a large rat brain .
And all of you are primates .
And so was Darwin .
I love to think that Darwin would have really appreciated this .
It is just a large primate brain .
Why does it cost so much energy , then ?
So we did the math .
What about us ?
How did we get here , then ?
So what is the human advantage ?
What is it that we have that no other animal has ?
In two words , we cook .
No other animal cooks its food . Only humans do .
And I think that &apos;s how we got to become human .
Studying the human brain changed the way I think about food .
Thank you very much .
Philip Zimbardo : The psychology of time
All right , start the clock please . 30 seconds studio .
Keep it quiet please . Settle down .
It &apos;s about time . End sequence . Take one .
15 seconds studio .
&quot; One bite , Adam . Don &apos;t abandon Eve . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know , guys .
I don &apos;t want to get in trouble . &quot;
&quot; Okay . One bite . What the hell ? &quot;
Promised virtues fall prey to the passions of the moment .
And most of them did so without using birth control .
So much for promises .
Now lets tempt four-year-olds , giving them a treat .
What happens is two-thirds of the kids give in to temptation .
They cannot wait . The others , of course , wait .
They resist the temptation . They delay the now for later .
The kids who resisted scored 250 points higher on the SAT .
And you do it automatically and non-consciously .
What determines any decision you make ?
For others , the present is irrelevant .
So that their decisions are based on past memories .
Their focus is always about anticipated consequences .
Cost-benefit analysis .
You can focus on past-positive , or past-negative .
You can be future-oriented , setting goals .
So , very quickly , what is the optimal time profile ?
High on past-positive . Moderately high on future .
And moderate on present-hedonism .
And always low on past-negative and present-fatalism .
Any time perspective in excess has more negatives than positives .
What do futures sacrifice for success ?
They sacrifice family time . They sacrifice friend time .
They sacrifice fun time . They sacrifice personal indulgence .
And they live for work , achievement and control .
I &apos;m sure that resonates with some of the TEDsters .
Thank you so much .
Becky Blanton : The year I was homeless
I became one of the working homeless .
His death hit me pretty hard .
At first , living in the van was great .
I showered in campgrounds . I ate out regularly .
And I had time to relax and to grieve .
The doggy went into doggy day care .
And I sweated .
Or I washed up in public rest rooms .
Food rotted in the heat .
And I faced a whole new set of challenges .
I didn &apos;t always succeed .
But I felt out of control of my life .
I hadn &apos;t changed . My I.Q. hadn &apos;t dropped .
But I had changed somehow .
I spiraled deeper and deeper into a depression .
And eventually someone referred me to a homeless health clinic .
And I went . I hadn &apos;t bathed in three days .
I was as smelly and as depressed as anyone in line .
I just wasn &apos;t drunk or high .
The real homeless don &apos;t have hope . &quot;
You should too .
And I stood there . And I reread my essay .
And I cried .
Because I was a writer .
I was a writer .
Shortly after that I moved back to Tennessee .
And I started writing again .
I was no longer homeless .
And I was no longer invisible .
So the homeless , the working homeless , primarily remain invisible .
The human spirit can overcome anything if it has hope .
Hope always , always finds a way . Thank you .
Béatrice Coron : Stories cut from paper
I am a papercutter .
I cut stories .
So my process is very straightforward .
So I didn &apos;t come to papercutting in a straight line .
In fact , I see it more as a spiral .
I was not born with a blade in my hand .
And I don &apos;t remember papercutting as a child .
But I was also a rebel .
I moved for two years in Taiwan .
And it &apos;s also just getting to the essential of things .
So artist books have a lot of definitions .
They come in a lot of different shapes .
They can be with words or without words .
And I have a passion for images and for words .
I love pun and the relation to the unconscious .
I love oddities of languages .
So as you can guess , my mother tongue is French .
And my daily language is English .
So one of these works is the &quot; Spelling Spider . &quot;
So the Spelling Spider is a cousin of the spelling bee .
But it &apos;s much more connected to the Web .
And this spider spins a bilingual alphabet .
And one ancient form of the book is scrolls .
And I &apos;m making all those kinds of windows .
So it &apos;s to look beyond the surface .
It &apos;s to have a look at different worlds .
And very often I &apos;ve been an outsider .
It &apos;s all if .
So what if we were living in balloon houses ?
It would make a very uplifting world .
And we would leave a very low footprint on the planet .
It would be so light .
And we can use them also as a safety net .
And my inspirations are very eclectic .
I &apos;m influenced by everything I read , everything I see .
Other ones are historical .
Here it &apos;s &quot; CandyCity . &quot;
It &apos;s a non-sugar-coated history of sugar .
Other times , it &apos;s not even my stories .
I call them Freudian cities .
&quot; ModiCity . &quot;
&quot; ElectriCity . &quot;
&quot; MAD Growth on Columbus Circle . &quot;
&quot; ReefCity . &quot;
&quot; A Web of Time . &quot;
&quot; Chaos City . &quot;
&quot; Daily Battles . &quot;
&quot; FeliCity . &quot;
&quot; Floating Islands . &quot;
So it &apos;s actually a papercut that &apos;s nine yards long .
So in life and in papercutting , everything is connected .
One story leads to another .
And parallel to my cutting is my running .
Larger images , I started to run marathons .
Then I went to run 50K , then 60K .
Then I ran 50 miles -- ultramarathons .
And running gives me a lot of energy .
The result is &quot; Hells and Heavens . &quot;
It &apos;s two panels 13 ft. high .
There is no border in between .
Other people make the opposite trip .
That &apos;s the border .
You have sweatshops in hells .
You have people renting their wings in the heavens .
So you can take it off the wall .
It &apos;s not autobiographical identities .
They are more our social identities .
That &apos;s another artist book project .
Why do I call it a book ?
So artist books , you take them off the wall .
You take them for a walk .
You can also install them as public art .
I love public art .
And I entered competitions for a long time .
It was for a merger station for emergency workers and firemen .
I called it &quot; Working in the Same Direction . &quot;
With public art , I could also make cut glass .
Here it &apos;s faceted glass in the Bronx .
It is travel in time , travel on time .
Then I have the fruit from Europe for the ranchers .
And then the fruit of the world for Silicon Valley today .
And it &apos;s still growing .
I also planted the bibliotree .
And it &apos;s all about international writing systems .
And on the branches you have library material growing .
You can also have function and form with public art .
So in Aurora , Colorado it &apos;s a bench .
But you have a bonus with this bench .
It &apos;s a story about transformation and connections .
So each building has its own personality .
It &apos;s called Rue des Prairies -- Prairie Street .
So that was a very captive audience .
And I wanted to give them an escape .
I created &quot; All Around Town . &quot;
So I can call it techno-crafted .
But the result is always to have stories .
So the stories , they have a lot of possibilities .
They have a lot of scenarios .
I don &apos;t know the stories .
And it &apos;s what story cutting is all about .
Sergey Brin + Larry Page : The genesis of Google
We spoke to you last several years ago .
The answer is boxers .
Now I hope all of you feel better .
Audience : Yes .
SB : What is it ?
But this is what helped me see it .
Here it &apos;s slightly logged .
And they &apos;re labeled by color right now , by language .
We have Tokyo coming in in Japanese .
There &apos;s a lot of activity in China .
There &apos;s a lot of activity in India .
There &apos;s some in the Middle East , the little pockets .
Australia , because there just aren &apos;t very many people there .
So this is slowed down .
This is what one second looks like .
You can see that it got started right here .
But it didn &apos;t have quite the same pickup in the U.S.
as it did in Spain .
And I just wanted to play it for you .
More animals , if they start doing searches as well .
Now does anybody know who this is ?
A-ha !
Audience : Orkut .
SB : Yes ! Somebody got it .
This is Orkut . Is anybody here on Orkut ?
Do we have any ?
Okay , not very many people know about it .
I &apos;ll explain it in a second .
This is one of our engineers .
That &apos;s how we churn those products out .
Orkut had a vision to create a social network .
So this is what he built .
This is our VP of Engineering .
And these are all of his friends .
And now we &apos;ve grown to over 100,000 members .
So it &apos;s a fun little project .
And -- well , I &apos;ll leave you in suspense .
Larry , you can explain this one .
Larry Page : Thank you , Sergey .
So many , many useful things come out of this .
and they would try to make a product .
And this is how we keep our innovation running .
Don &apos;t really pay attention to them .
And the top thing , actually , is the Deskbar .
Raise your hands .
How many of you use the Deskbar ?
All right , see ? You guys should try it out .
Thank you , Sergey .
This is actually our &quot; cult picture . &quot;
I just wanted to show quickly .
And I think we &apos;ve done a good job encouraging that .
It makes it a really fun place to work .
You want it to be consistent .
Why don &apos;t we try changing it every day ? &quot;
And , you know , thank you .
I don &apos;t have to do my other job now . &quot;
And in fact , the ultimate search engine would be smart .
It would be artificial intelligence .
Maybe , Sergey , you can highlight this .
He was just kind of writing about his life .
Why don &apos;t they like my blog ? &quot;
And then we produced &quot; You suck . &quot;
And finally , it ended with &quot; Kiss my ass . &quot;
And that &apos;s unlike many of our competitors .
So thank you .
Rita Pierson : Every kid needs a champion
Some of those reforms have been good .
Some of them have been not so good .
And we know why kids drop out .
We know why kids don &apos;t learn .
George Washington Carver says all learning is understanding relationships .
For years , I have watched people teach .
They pay me to teach a lesson .
The kids should learn it .
I think Stephen Covey had the right idea .
You ever thought about that ?
Tell a kid you &apos;re sorry , they &apos;re in shock .
I taught a lesson once on ratios .
And I got back and looked at that teacher edition .
I &apos;d taught the whole lesson wrong .
They said , &quot; That &apos;s okay , Ms. Pierson .
You were so excited , we just let you go . &quot;
And it was difficult . It was awfully hard .
One year I came up with a bright idea .
One of the students said , &quot; Really ? &quot;
You just have to strut . &quot;
I was somebody when I came .
I &apos;ll be a better somebody when I leave .
I am powerful , and I am strong .
I deserve the education that I get here .
And they said , &quot; Yeah ! &quot;
And so — I gave a quiz , 20 questions .
A student missed 18 .
I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
I said , &quot; Because you &apos;re on a roll .
See , it &apos;s hard to teach kids who stink .
And kids can be cruel .
You made it work for me .
Can we stand to have more relationships ? Absolutely .
Will you like all your children ? Of course not .
And you know your toughest kids are never absent .
It &apos;s the connection . It &apos;s the relationships .
We teach anyway , because that &apos;s what we do .
Teaching and learning should bring joy .
But it is not impossible .
We can do this . We &apos;re educators .
We &apos;re born to make a difference .
Thank you so much .
Richard Weller : Could the sun be good for your heart ?
And they are not magnanimous in victory .
I could accept that .
And of course , they were right .
All of these things .
Now , sunlight , of course , comes into this .
I distinctly -- nobody forgets cod liver oil .
And it is , to prevent rickets and so on .
And the evidence for it preventing cancers is not yet great .
It &apos;s not the only reason preventing heart disease .
Now , in Aberdeen , I started my dermatology training .
It also dilates the coronary arteries , so it stops angina .
So it &apos;s not just in the cardiovascular system it arises .
It arises in the skin .
How do you have low blood pressure in your skin ?
It &apos;s not the heart . What do you do ?
And I was interested in these really complex systems .
And I then moved back to Edinburgh .
So they &apos;re really an ideal model .
So these are kind of sunlamps .
So we used ultraviolet A , which doesn &apos;t make vitamin D.
Now , we &apos;re still collecting data .
I &apos;m not sure exactly how much .
This is separate from vitamin D.
But this is a separate mechanism from vitamin D.
That is an absolutely fundamental physiological principle .
Different wavelengths of light have different activities of doing that .
So Ventura is in southern California .
In summer , you might as well be at the equator .
It &apos;s great . Lots of NO is released .
Ventura mid-winter , well , there &apos;s still a decent amount .
So what do we think ?
We think it &apos;s very important .
So , thank you very much indeed .
Anne Milgram : Why smart statistics are the key to fighting crime
And I couldn &apos;t get this information out .
I ran the Camden Police Department because of that .
We have no suspects . &quot;
We weren &apos;t using data-driven policing .
We were essentially trying to fight crime with yellow Post-it notes .
So I wanted to do things differently .
In short , I wanted to moneyball criminal justice .
And we reduced all crime in the city by 26 percent .
We also changed the way we did criminal prosecutions .
We have 12 million arrests every single year .
Less than five percent of all arrests are for violent crime .
They haven &apos;t yet been convicted of a crime .
They &apos;re just waiting for their day in court .
And 67 percent of people come back .
Our recidivism rate is amongst the highest in the world .
It impacts everything .
It impacts sentencing .
It impacts whether someone gets drug treatment .
It impacts crime and violence .
They mean it and they believe it .
The reason for this is the way we make decisions .
What we need in this space are strong data and analytics .
And so we built a universal risk assessment tool .
And it looks like this .
And with this tool , we can predict three things .
Now I want to say something really important .
I don &apos;t .
Some people call it data science .
I call it moneyballing criminal justice .
Thank you .
Stefano Mancuso : The roots of plant intelligence
Sometimes I go browsing &#91; through &#93; a very old magazine .
I found this observation test about the story of the ark .
Some of them are very easy .
Some of them are about the animals , the number .
And this problem is : where are the plants ?
Why ?
Plants are not living creatures -- this is the point .
Here we have the description of the order of nature .
This is not the common man .
The &quot; Homo studiosus &quot; -- the studying man .
But it &apos;s something completely wrong .
You know very well about professors .
They are much more sophisticated in sensing than animals .
Let &apos;s have a look at this short movie now .
We have David Attenborough .
Now , when he speaks about plants , everything is correct .
They have just a kind of very low-level soul .
Let &apos;s see .
This is a very fast movement .
But plants are also able to show a lot of movement .
Some of them are very well known , like the flowering .
Some of them are much more sophisticated .
They are also able to play -- they are really playing .
But they are also able to sleep .
This is one , Mimosa pudica .
It &apos;s a kind of vegetarian experimentation .
Plants are even able to communicate -- they are extraordinary communicators .
They communicate with other plants .
They are able to distinguish kin and non-kin .
This is a serious business .
How is it possible to do this without a brain ?
The title is &quot; The Power of Movement in Plants . &quot;
before Charles Darwin .
This is not a metaphor .
Now , this is a root apex growing against a slope .
We have almost 14 million roots .
They work in the same way .
And why are they so similar ?
Because they evolved for the same reason : to survive predation .
They work in the same way .
And another possibility is a technological possibility .
We have the androids that are inspired by man .
But why have we not any plantoid ?
It &apos;s much more easy to build hybrids .
They have computing power , they have electrical signals .
Well , thank you for your attention .
Thank you .
Liu Bolin : The invisible man
This work is called Xia Gang .
The six people in the photo are Xia Gang workers .
This piece is called The Studio .
I found that any culture has its irreconcilable contradictions .
This is a joint effort between me and French artist JR .
So I tried to make my eyes bigger with my fingers .
But still they are not big enough for JR , unfortunately .
So I tried to make my eyes bigger with this gesture .
But it doesn &apos;t work , my eyes are still small .
LB : This one is about 9 / 11 memories .
This is an aircraft carrier moored alongside the Hudson River .
Kenny Scharf &apos;s graffiti .
This is Venice , Italy .
This is the ancient city of Pompeii .
Interpreter : This is the ancient city of Pompeii .
LB : This is the Borghese Gallery in Rome .
For instance , why would I make myself invisible ?
What will making myself invisible here cause people to think ?
This one is called Instant Noodles .
Interpreter : This one is called Instant Noodles .
These phosphors can even cause cancer .
There is no Photoshop involved .
There is no Photoshop involved .
LB : These works are on China &apos;s cultural memories .
And this one , this is about food safety in China .
That &apos;s all I want to say .
Thank you .
We will talk today about local warming .
This message is given as a public service .
Blogging affects your posture . We start with the posture .
And be careful , your genes are in danger .
Will geeks become endangered species ?
Global warming fun .
But let &apos;s keep things in proportion .
You should stay cool with the appropriate clothing .
You should care about your posture -- this is not right .
You are great . This is the correct posture .
Scrotal temperature reflects intratesticular temperature and is lowered by shaving .
Digital scrotum , digital media .
And this is what the young generation says .
4 am in the morning .
You cannot use this picture .
Anybody feels threatened , anybody really need it ?
Any lady , any lady ? Thank you very much .
Joe Smith : How to use a paper towel
We can do that .
Now there are all kinds of paper towel dispensers .
There &apos;s the tri-fold . People typically take two or three .
People go one , two , three , four , tear .
This much , right ?
There &apos;s the one that cuts itself .
People go , one , two , three , four .
Let &apos;s hear it . Shake . Louder .
Audience : Shake .
Joe Smith : Your word is &quot; fold . &quot;
Audience : Fold .
JS : Again .
Audience : Fold . JS : Really loud .
Audience : Shake . Fold .
JS : Okay . Wet hands .
Tri-fold . Fold ...
Dry .
Audience : Shake .
Fold .
Audience : Shake . Fold .
JS : Cuts itself .
If you think this isn &apos;t as good ...
Audience : Shake . Fold .
It &apos;s way too big a towel .
Let me tell you a secret .
It &apos;s smart enough to stop .
And you get half a towel .
Audience : Shake . Fold .
And next year , toilet paper .
Michael Sandel : The lost art of democratic debate
We need to rediscover the lost art of democratic argument .
I have a suggestion .
So , are you ready for the lecture ?
According to Aristotle , justice means giving people what they deserve .
That &apos;s it ; that &apos;s the lecture .
Take the example of flutes .
Suppose we &apos;re distributing flutes .
Who should get the best ones ?
Let &apos;s see what people -- What would you say ?
Who should get the best flute ?
You can just call it out .
Who else ?
The best flute players .
The worst flute players .
How many say the best flute players ?
Why ?
Actually , that was Aristotle &apos;s answer too .
But here &apos;s a harder question .
Peter : The greatest benefit to all .
The greatest benefit to all .
That &apos;s Peter ?
All right .
Well , it &apos;s a good reason .
That &apos;s all right .
It &apos;ll be a happy byproduct that we &apos;ll all benefit .
Let &apos;s take a contemporary example of the dispute about justice .
It had to do with golf .
In fact , it carried risk of injury .
They said , &quot; No .
Now that would give you an unfair advantage . &quot;
He says , &quot; I &apos;m a great golfer .
I want to compete .
Suppose you were on the Supreme Court .
Suppose you were deciding the justice of this case .
And how many say , no , he doesn &apos;t ?
How many would rule in favor of Casey Martin ?
All right , we have a good division of opinion here .
What would be your reason ?
How would you answer the objection ?
Yes , all right .
Audience : The cart &apos;s not part of the game .
What &apos;s your name ?
Charlie : The cart &apos;s not part of the game .
But what about walking from hole to hole ?
Walking the course is not part of the game of golf ?
Charlie : Not in my book , it isn &apos;t .
All right . Stay there , Charlie .
Who has an answer for Charlie ?
All right , who has an answer for Charlie ?
What would you say ?
Walking all those holes ?
That &apos;s part of the game of golf ?
What &apos;s your name ?
Warren .
Charlie , what do you say to Warren ?
Charley : I &apos;ll stick to my original thesis .
Warren , are you a golfer ?
Warren : I am not a golfer .
Charley : And I am .
You know , it &apos;s interesting .
Is walking the course essential to the game ?
And they brought in Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer .
And what do you suppose they all said ?
Yes . They agreed with Warren .
The fatigue factor is an important part of golf .
The Supreme Court decided .
What do you suppose they said ?
Seven to two , they ruled .
And the Supreme Court justices wrestled with that question .
Here &apos;s how he put it .
Justice Scalia &apos;s opinion is questionable for two reasons .
First , no real sports fan would talk that way .
It &apos;s also objectionable on a second ground .
What would it be ?
Let everyone ride in a golf cart if they want to .
Then the fairness objection goes away .
Why ?
And how many favor the second , same-sex marriage ?
That &apos;s really what marriage is about .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Thanks . Thank you .
Chris .
Thanks , Chris .
Now look , you &apos;re a pioneer of open education .
What &apos;s your vision for the next phase of this ?
Well , I think that it is possible .
That &apos;s what I would love to do .
Michael Sandel . Thank you so much .
Vikram Patel : Mental health for all by involving all
I want you to imagine this for a moment .
Rajiv suffers from a mental illness .
I see some nodding heads there .
In reality , take a guess .
Shea Hembrey : How I became 100 artists
And my dad is the most voracious reader I know .
He can read a novel or two a day .
So I should talk about art .
Or we &apos;ll be here all day with my childhood stories .
One of them , I call my Mimaw &apos;s Test .
It needs to worked on until it can speak fluently .
I &apos;m just going to make the whole thing myself .
And so this is what I did .
So I thought , a biennial needs artists .
It &apos;s going to be two years of studio work .
So I should start to talk about these guys .
Well the range is quite a bit .
This isn &apos;t Photoshopped .
I &apos;m under the river with those fish .
This is Nell Remmel .
And this is 22 feet long .
And I love to dig a hole .
And she &apos;s making weather on her body &apos;s scale .
And this piece is &quot; Frost . &quot;
The sun rises , and it melts away .
And that was played by my mom .
One of these is scratch-off masterpieces .
He draws sticks real good . &quot;
Which is one of the best compliments ever .
For this family , he made this still-life painting .
This project is called &quot; Love Nests . &quot;
And this one &apos;s called &quot; Lovelock &apos;s Nest . &quot;
This one &apos;s called &quot; Mixtape Love Song &apos;s Nest . &quot;
And this one &apos;s called &quot; Lovemaking Nest . &quot;
Next is Sylvia Slater .
Sylvia &apos;s interested in art training .
She &apos;s a very serious Swiss artist .
So this life price is for an irrigation non-profit director .
And this one had to get broken up .
This is by a duo , Michael Abernathy and Bud Holland .
And they &apos;re interested in creating culture , just tradition .
So they came up with &quot; dig jigs . &quot;
And we got a lot of attention when we did it .
That &apos;s my mom and dad .
This is by Jason Birdsong .
We just have that natural way of seeing .
And he plays with this idea .
And this piece : those aren &apos;t actually leaves .
They &apos;re butterfly specimens who have a natural camouflage .
So he pairs these up .
There &apos;s another pile of leaves .
Those are actually all real butterfly specimens .
And he pairs these up with paintings .
Like this is a painting of a snake in a box .
But it &apos;s actually a painting .
The next artist is Hazel Clausen .
So that &apos;s what she did .
And that &apos;s the symbol of their culture .
This is a typical angora embroidery for them .
This is one of their founders , Gert Schaeffer .
And actually this is my Aunt Irene .
And they &apos;re really interested in how over-coddled we &apos;ve become .
And this is called &quot; Horse Sense Fence . &quot;
And he &apos;s reworking a Confucian art tradition of scholar stones .
Next is Maynard Sipes .
Next is by a Lithuanian fortune teller , Jurgi Petrauskas .
Next is Ginger Cheshire .
The next , this is by Sam Sandy .
This is from Estelle Willoughsby .
She heals with color .
Next is by Vera Sokolova .
And I have to say , Vera kind of scares me .
Next , this is by Thomas Swifton .
And after this one , there &apos;s 77 other artists .
Thank you . Thank you .
Thanks .
Thank you . Thanks .
Joan Halifax : Compassion and the true meaning of empathy
I want to address the issue of compassion .
Compassion has many faces .
They are not luxuries .
Without them , humanity cannot survive . &quot;
It is the big cats , and it &apos;s the plankton .
Two weeks ago , I was in Bangalore in India .
And early in the morning , I went into the ward .
I looked into her face .
I looked up .
I watched her hands as she bathed an old man .
Again , the eyes and hands of Avalokiteshvara .
They touched me at that time .
They have touched me throughout my 68 years .
And that woman did not have sentimental compassion .
She had phenomenal strength .
So we can ask : What is compassion comprised of ?
And there are various facets .
And there &apos;s referential and non-referential compassion .
That component is that we cannot be attached to outcome .
Now I worked with dying people for over 40 years .
That compassion is actually an inherent human quality .
It is there within every human being .
The very word terror is global .
The very feeling of terror is global .
However , they return to baseline a lot sooner .
This is called resilience .
It hooks up all parts of the brain .
Hey , we live in a very noxious world .
Why don &apos;t we train our children in compassion ?
And that is the mental quality of equanimity .
And the archetype of this in Buddhism is Avalokiteshvara , Kuan-Yin .
And they have actualized compassion through direct action .
Jody Williams called it : It &apos;s good to meditate .
Step back , give your mother a break , okay .
He said , &quot; I &apos;m out of here . &quot;
He &apos;s going down the path .
He sees something in the path .
The wound is just filled with maggots .
May we actualize that capacity for women everywhere .
Thank you .
Jeff Hawkins : How brain science will change computing
I &apos;m going to talk all about that .
I thought the word framework was great .
That &apos;s when I designed all those computer products .
So why should we have a good brain theory ?
Well , there &apos;s lots of reasons people do science .
Why do we study ants ? Well , it &apos;s interesting .
So why don &apos;t we have a good theory of brains ?
And people have been working on it for 100 years .
This is normal science .
Normal science is a nice balance between theory and experimentalists .
And it goes back and forth , you know ?
You can &apos;t imagine how much detail we know about brains .
What good is more going to do ?
I even think Chris said something like this yesterday .
Some people say , brains can &apos;t understand brains .
Very Zen-like . Whoo .
They all have a lot in common with brain science .
But it got more manageable once they had a theory .
The best minds were stumped -- really , really smart people .
We &apos;re not smarter now than they were then .
It was an intuitive , strong-held belief that was wrong .
So it was intuitive and obvious . Now what about evolution ?
And the same thing about tectonic plates , you know ?
What it is is intelligence is defined by prediction .
Reality though , I call it real intelligence .
Real intelligence is built on something else .
And that somehow , prediction leads to intelligent behavior .
And the alligator has some very sophisticated senses .
It can attack . It can do all kinds of stuff .
But it has all this complex behavior already .
Now , in evolution , what happened ?
You do . It &apos;s your emotional brain .
So let me give you a few examples of predictions .
I have this thing called the altered door thought experiment .
Now I could change your doorknob in other ways .
You &apos;re constantly making predictions about your environment .
And that &apos;s because you &apos;re making a prediction .
Here &apos;s three visions of an object .
So what is the recipe for brain theory ?
First of all , we have to have the right framework .
Now biologists generally are not good theoreticians .
You have to make these theories very realistic in anatomical terms .
So what will brain theory look like ?
It &apos;s also memory of sequences .
You cannot learn or recall anything outside of a sequence .
But they &apos;re very different types of memories .
Not that robots aren &apos;t useful and people can build robots .
So you &apos;re not going to see C-3PO .
We can also do intelligent security systems .
Those are the things that are going to happen first .
But ultimately , the world &apos;s the limit here .
I don &apos;t know how this is going to turn out .
John Bohannon : Dance vs. powerpoint , a modest proposal
Good afternoon .
As you &apos;re all aware , we face difficult economic times .
It makes it hotter . It &apos;s happening right now .
Now a laser is different .
First you trap atoms in a special bottle .
It enters a new state of matter called a superfluid .
I have a Ph.D in molecular biology .
I still barely understand what most scientists are talking about .
Now , the idea is not as crazy as it sounds .
I started a contest four years ago called Dance Your Ph.D.
Now surprisingly , it seems to work .
Dance really can make science easier to understand .
But don &apos;t take my word for it .
Go on the Internet and search for &quot; Dance Your Ph.D. &quot;
There are hundreds of dancing scientists waiting for you .
They do it by changing their shape .
So that allows cells to ooze along in the right directions .
And this brings me to my modest proposal .
It distracts them with pretty pictures , irrelevant data .
So now my country is 15 trillion dollars in debt .
One idea is to drastically reduce public support for the arts .
One certainly can &apos;t argue with those numbers .
It &apos;s sure to help .
Cynthia Breazeal : The rise of personal robots
But robots are still not in our home , ironically .
But one really struck me .
Scientist : I want to show you something .
I almost lost it this week .
It didn &apos;t speak language , but it didn &apos;t matter .
And one of my favorite robots is Leonardo .
We developed Leonardo in collaboration with Stan Winston Studio .
Matt Berlin : Hello , Leo .
Leo , this is Cookie Monster .
Can you find Cookie Monster ?
Leo , Cookie Monster is very bad .
He &apos;s very bad , Leo .
Cookie Monster is very , very bad .
He &apos;s a scary monster .
He wants to get your cookies .
It turns out it &apos;s the same for robots .
Mimicry &apos;s believed to play a role , but how ?
Is it the mimicking of particular gestures that matters ?
But with the robot , you can .
He &apos;s a psychologist we &apos;ve been collaborating with .
The first was just the screen .
This is just like video conferencing today .
And then the fully expressive MeBot .
We looked at overall engagement .
We looked at their desire to cooperate .
Let &apos;s think about some other domains , like maybe health .
So we actually explored this idea in our lab .
This is a robot , Autom .
Cory Kidd developed this robot for his doctoral work .
And it was designed to be a robot diet-and-exercise coach .
It had a couple of simple non-verbal skills it could do .
It could make eye contact with you .
It could share information looking down at a screen .
And then it could help track that for you .
One case was the robot you saw there , Autom .
The quality of advice was identical .
People would name the robots .
They would dress the robots .
They didn &apos;t do this with a computer .
But we can push this idea further .
What if -- Nathan : Here it comes . Yay !
CB : -- the character itself could come into your world ?
So they are now sending the character back into that world .
And now it &apos;s got number power .
But I want to do more than that .
I actually want them to create those experiences .
I think that &apos;s very , very important .
So this is a new project .
What they care about is the robot .
Robots touch something deeply human within us .
Thank you .
Charles Limb : Building the musical muscle
This is what we want out of our senses .
We want beauty ; we don &apos;t just want function .
Likewise for hearing .
Really what we want to hear is music .
Music is just one of the strangest things that there is .
That process is entirely abstract and very , very unusual .
She &apos;s in a very supportive environment .
Her mother &apos;s doing everything she can .
Okay , play that video please .
Mother : That &apos;s an owl .
Owl , yeah .
Owl . Owl .
Yeah .
Baby . Baby .
You want it ?
And that was the best you could do for hearing loss .
Back then you couldn &apos;t even look at the eardrum .
It &apos;s surgically placed inside the inner ear .
But here is that same girl who is implanted now .
This is her 10 years later .
If we could play this video please .
John Niparko : So you &apos;ve written two books ?
Girl : I have written two books .
Girl : No , the other one was a book .
Do you remember writing that chapter ?
Girl : Yes I do . I remember writing every chapter .
JN : Yeah .
Girl : Well sometimes my sister can be kind of annoying .
So it comes in handy to not be annoyed by her .
JN : I see . And who is that ?
Girl : Holly .
Mother : Her sister . Girl : My sister .
JN : And how can you avoid being annoyed by her ?
It comes in handy .
Girl : No .
CL : And so she &apos;s phenomenal .
Now there are a lot of reasons for that .
Language is very different . Language is very precise .
Music is entirely different .
The acoustics of music are much harder than those of language .
Because I always view music as the pinnacle of hearing .
Now the problems begin first with pitch perception .
Now this is a MIDI arrangement of Rachmaninoff &apos;s Prelude .
Now if we could just play this .
Go ahead and play this one .
And it might be that you kind of like that .
That &apos;s kind of hypnotic .
But it certainly wasn &apos;t the way the music was intended .
Most cochlear implant users cannot tell the difference between an instrument .
If we could play these two sound clips in succession .
The trumpet .
And the second one .
That &apos;s a violin .
These have similar wave forms . They &apos;re both sustained instruments .
Cochlear implant users cannot tell the difference between these instruments .
Go ahead and play that .
I had patients tell me that those sound the same .
They cannot differentiate sound quality differences between those two clips .
Now the question comes to mind : Is there any hope ?
And yes , there is hope .
Now I don &apos;t know if anybody knows who this is .
This is ... does somebody know ?
This is Beethoven .
Now why would we know what Beethoven &apos;s skull looks like ?
Because his grave was exhumed .
But Beethoven composed music long after he lost his hearing .
The brains remain hardwired for music .
Text : Beethoven doesn &apos;t excite her .
The &quot; 1812 Overture &quot; isn &apos;t worth waking for .
But she jumps to action when called to duty !
Now I want to show you one last video .
And here &apos;s a video of Joseph .
Joseph : I was born in 1986 .
Not long after , I was fitted with hearing aids .
And it was absolutely wonderful .
Since then , I &apos;ve never looked back .
CL : Joseph is phenomenal . He &apos;s brilliant .
There are almost no deaf surgeons anywhere .
You don &apos;t actually have to hear it .
So I just want to conclude with the following words .
Restoration of basic sensory function is critical .
And I want to thank you for your time .
Michael Green : Why we should build wooden skyscrapers
This is my grandfather .
And this is my son .
These are my buildings .
That &apos;s a wonderful thing .
That &apos;s one billion people in the world live in slums .
A hundred million people in the world are homeless .
They &apos;re the materials of the last century .
This is a U.S. statistic about the impact of greenhouse gases .
That &apos;s what people jump to as a conclusion .
That &apos;s the change .
Mass timber panels are those 24-dot bricks .
Fair enough .
And the way I describe it is this .
The next big issue , deforestation .
The last thing we want to do is cut down trees .
That &apos;s how much it takes .
The carbon story here is a really good one .
The engineering is , truthfully , the easy part of this .
And the way I describe it is this .
It &apos;s really just the structure that we &apos;re talking about .
Buildings are starting to go up around the world .
And I believe the race is ultimately on .
Thank you .
Beardyman : The polyphonic me
What is possible with the human voice ?
Ooh baby baby baby baby baby baby Yeah .
I was constantly experimenting with these noises .
And I &apos;m still on that mission .
And there &apos;s things that no one &apos;s voice can do .
But that &apos;s cheating .
And it hurts your throat .
And I &apos;m going to show you what it can do .
So the polyphony problem : I &apos;ve only got one voice .
By dancing . It &apos;s like this .
Thanks .
So that &apos;s probably the easiest way .
I &apos;m going to lay down a bass sound now .
And now , a rockabilly guitar .
And now I have that , I have that recorded .
Assign it to a keyboard .
So that &apos;s cool .
Impossible , you say . No .
So every noise you can hear there is my voice .
I didn &apos;t just trigger something which sounds like that .
There &apos;s no samples . There &apos;s no synthesizers .
Why do this ?
Like this .
Thank you very much , ladies and gentlemen .
Lee Cronin : Making matter come alive
So this is a start .
Now this quest started four billion years ago on planet Earth .
There &apos;s been four billion years of organic , biological life .
And I &apos;m absolutely enthralled by biology .
I love to do synthetic biology .
I love things that are alive .
I love manipulating the infrastructure of biology .
And so forget about evolution in a kind of metaphysical way .
And this seems quite a profound question .
So this raises three really important questions : What is life ?
Is biology special ?
Biologists seem to think so .
Is matter evolvable ?
So here &apos;s some inorganic life .
This is an inorganic tube .
Of course , they &apos;re not alive .
You can see there &apos;s architecture growing , filling the void .
And this is dead .
Let &apos;s see if we can actually make life .
In fact , we were the only people in the universe .
Now , that &apos;s a bit boring .
Is life that improbable ? &quot;
And this is really the question .
And in fact , let &apos;s take that one step further .
In biology , carbon takes center stage .
Well what about matter ?
So think , this is a serious question .
And we also have to be aware of the issues .
And forgive the complicated diagram .
This is just a collection of pathways in the cell .
And the cell is obviously for us a fascinating thing .
Synthetic biologists are manipulating it .
Chemists are trying to study the molecules to look at disease .
But what does a cell do ?
Well it divides , it competes , it survives .
But what else is life characterized by ?
And from this stuff we came .
And we went through a variety of worlds .
The RNA people would talk about the RNA world .
We somehow got to proteins and DNA .
We then got to the last ancestor .
Evolution kicked in -- and that &apos;s the cool bit .
And here we are .
But there &apos;s a roadblock that you can &apos;t get past .
So we don &apos;t know how we got here .
I &apos;m not a politician , I &apos;m a scientist .
This seems most likely .
So we have some kind of primordial soup .
And somehow these amino acids are combined , and life begins .
But life begins , what does that mean ?
What is life ? What is this stuff of life ?
And the answer , of course , lies with mice .
This is how I remember what I need as a chemist .
I say , &quot; Well I want molecules . &quot;
But I need a metabolism , I need some energy .
I need some information , and I need a container .
Because if I want evolution , I need containers to compete .
So these things together give us evolution , perhaps .
Carbon is banned .
But we need to make some containers .
And you can see on the screen a cell being made .
And this movie here shows this competition between molecules .
Molecules are competing for stuff .
They want their shape to persist .
And that is the key .
If we manage to do that , forget the molecular detail .
Let &apos;s zoom out to what that could mean .
And that &apos;s really worth thinking about .
Does evolution control the sophistication of matter in the universe ?
So imagine we make a little cell .
We should take our inspiration from biology .
Biology doesn &apos;t care about the design unless it works .
So this will reorganize the way we design things .
Evolution cannot be cut apart .
You need to somehow find the fitness function .
You &apos;re sitting on chairs .
They &apos;re inanimate , they &apos;re not alive .
So what does it mean about defining life ?
We really struggle to do this .
Thank you very much .
Just a quick question on timeline .
You believe you &apos;re going to be successful in this project ?
When ?
And when do you think that will happen ?
LC : Hopefully within the next two years .
That would be a big story .
LC : I think it &apos;s 100 percent .
Lee Cronin , good luck .
Helen Fisher : The brain in love
So , this is the short story of that research .
His name was Jasaw Chan K &apos;awiil .
He stood over six feet tall .
Around the world , people love .
They tell myths and legends about love .
Anthropologists have found evidence of romantic love in 170 societies .
They &apos;ve never found a society that did not have it .
But love isn &apos;t always a happy experience .
Almost nobody gets out of love alive .
I &apos;ve never had the opportunity to say it before .
I remember what you said to me .
I am thinking of your love for me .
I am torn by your love for me .
I am told you will go from here .
I am told you will leave me here .
My body is numb with grief .
Remember what I said , my love .
Goodbye , my love , goodbye . &quot;
Romantic love is one of the most powerful sensations on Earth .
It &apos;s way below your cognitive thinking process .
It &apos;s below your emotions .
Romantic love is an obsession . It possesses you .
You lose your sense of self .
You can &apos;t stop thinking about another human being .
Somebody is camping in your head .
Wild is love .
And the obsession can get worse when you &apos;ve been rejected .
So anyway , we found activity in three brain regions .
What a bad deal .
And indeed , we now know why .
How , you know , what have I lost ?
It is a need . It is an urge .
It is a homeostatic imbalance .
And indeed , it has all of the characteristics of addiction .
I would also like to tell the world that animals love .
As a matter of fact ethologists know this .
And I just simply say , &quot; Hardly . &quot;
And I said , I don &apos;t know .
Your childhood certainly plays a role , but nobody knows how .
And that &apos;s about it , that &apos;s all they know .
And 3.7 million people have taken the questionnaire in America .
About 600,000 people have taken it in 33 other countries .
I think there &apos;s biology to that .
These are two women .
Women tend to get intimacy differently than men do .
Women get intimacy from face-to-face talking .
This is intimacy to women .
Men tend to get intimacy from side-by-side doing .
So my final statement is : love is in us .
It &apos;s deeply embedded in the brain .
Our challenge is to understand each other . Thank you .
Pete Alcorn : The world in 2200
I used to be a Malthusian .
Here &apos;s why .
So what then ?
Most of the economic models are built around scarcity and growth .
Take away land speculation , price of land drops .
Number two : a declining population means scarce labor .
Scarce labor drives wages .
So why does this matter ?
Because transitions are dangerous times .
Fear for the future leads to some rash decisions .
Thank you .
Nathan Myhrvold : Could this laser zap malaria ?
We invent .
And we do that for a couple of reasons .
Almost all vaccines need to be kept at refrigerator temperatures .
We &apos;ve got a different solution .
So we made this thing .
Now , this is our second generations prototype .
It vends out little individual vials .
We &apos;ll move on to malaria .
Malaria is one of the great public health problems .
Esther Duflo talked a little bit about this .
Two hundred million people a year .
So what can we do about it ?
You can spray ; the problem is there are environmental issues .
You can try to treat people and create awareness .
It &apos;s a very difficult thing to make a vaccine for .
They don &apos;t always get to everyone .
Now , malaria is an incredibly complicated disease .
We could spend hours going over this .
One of those ways might be better diagnosis .
So we hope this year to prototype each of these devices .
We can see it because of this molecule called hemozoin .
Interesting , anyway , if you &apos;re a solid-state physicist .
This is our femtosecond laser lab .
So this creates pulses of light that last a femtosecond .
That &apos;s really , really , really short .
This is our thousand-core supercomputer .
Okay , we heard about bed nets earlier .
You spend a certain amount per bed net .
Or you could spray .
You can give drug administration .
How can you tell ?
We picked Madagascar .
We have all of the precipitation data and the temperature data .
So that sets the stage on which you do this .
Ultimately , it gives you this .
This is malaria spreading across Madagascar .
And this is this latter part of the rainy season .
We &apos;re going to the dry season now .
We also try to study our foe .
This is a high-speed camera view of a mosquito .
This is a real ad .
The United States did .
What can we do to the mosquito ?
Your Blu-ray player has a very cheap blue laser .
What if we could do that ?
Well , we could protect very high-value targets like clinics .
Clinics are full of people that have malaria .
You really want to protect them .
They &apos;re completely natural .
Now , it actually gets better than this .
Now , it turns out we only kill the female mosquitoes .
They &apos;re the only ones that are dangerous .
Mosquitoes only drink blood to lay eggs .
So , this sounds really crazy , right ?
Would you like to see it ?
We have the device over here .
Take it away Eric .
Next we can actually light them up with a laser .
So you may be able to hear some mosquitoes flying around .
NM : That &apos;s a mosquito wing beat you &apos;re hearing .
EJ : Finally , let &apos;s see what this looks like .
Here we have it running at high-speed mode .
This is very satisfying .
This is one of the first ones we did .
The energy &apos;s a little bit high here .
Here &apos;s another one . Bang .
The wing motor is very resilient .
So , that &apos;s what I have . Thanks very much .
Marco Annunziata : Welcome to the age of the industrial internet
And he was right , of course .
Now we are experiencing another metamorphic change : the industrial Internet .
It &apos;s the marriage of minds and machines .
And our lives will never be the same .
So what is this industrial Internet ?
It is asset optimization and system optimization .
They are self-aware , they are predictive , reactive and social .
Why does any of this matter at all ?
Let &apos;s start with aviation .
Something goes wrong unexpectedly .
So how can the industrial Internet help here ?
Or take healthcare .
If you need surgery , one hour matters .
Similar advances are happening in energy , including renewable energy .
And their interaction gets documented and stored in a searchable database .
And innovation is disruptive .
But let me stress two things here .
It makes products more affordable .
It creates new demand , new jobs .
But now let &apos;s take a step back .
Let &apos;s look at the big picture .
They say that all the growth-enhancing innovations are behind us .
The big discoveries are all behind us . &quot;
Human creativity and innovation have always propelled us forward .
They &apos;ve created jobs .
They &apos;ve raised living standards .
They &apos;ve made our lives healthier and more rewarding .
That is the size of the entire U.S. economy today .
But this is not a foregone conclusion .
We will need to invest in the new technologies .
We will need to adapt organizations and managerial practices .
This new technological revolution is upon us .
Thank you .
Adam Davidson : What we learned from teetering on the fiscal cliff
And this is what the inevitable problem looks like .
And at that moment our economy collapses .
But remember , Greece is there today .
Here &apos;s another way to look at exactly the same problem .
The dark blue line is how much the government spends .
The light blue line is how much the government gets in .
It gets really , really ugly out towards 2030 .
And this graph sort of sums up what the problem is .
Why don &apos;t we lower both lines ?
But that system has tons of problems .
Wealth piles up in the wrong places .
That &apos;s not going to create an equitable , fair society .
But here &apos;s what I learned .
But let me explain what I &apos;m thinking .
They like Social Security . They like Medicare .
Social Security is fairly easy to fix .
The rumors of its demise are always greatly exaggerated .
People generally are comfortable with it , Democrats and Republicans .
Raise medical health care contributions ?
We &apos;re not open to a discussion of eliminating it .
They way outweigh Democrats .
The vast majority want to protect military defense spending .
Now when it comes to taxes , there is more disagreement .
That &apos;s a more partisan area .
But that is not the case at all .
Roughly a third of Americans say that they are Democrats .
Around a quarter say that they are Republicans .
Now we get to fight about all sorts of other issues .
I go by the data . &quot;
And the data is very clear .
None of these major theories have been completely successful .
Those groups are very , very small .
And that part of it has not changed .
What has changed is how people respond to vague questions .
Or , &quot; Do you think the government should redistribute ? &quot;
Then you can see radical partisan change .
They don &apos;t represent what our views are .
We had the battle between Jefferson and Hamilton .
The Fed can &apos;t mess it up so badly .
And nothing happened at all .
The fear is that the world is watching .
Thank you .
Alberto Cairo : There are no scraps of men
I &apos;ve been in Afghanistan for 21 years .
We do more than that .
This is the place where we make the legs .
At that time I found myself in a strange situation .
I felt not quite ready for that job .
There was so much to learn .
There were so many things new to me .
But it was a terrific job .
There were many other things to do .
It was a strange sensation .
It &apos;s something that comes out from the past .
It &apos;s 21 years , but they are still all there .
Anyway , in 1992 , the Mujahideen took all Afghanistan .
And the orthopedic center was closed .
But one day , something happened .
I wanted to go home . I was driving .
And everybody disappeared from the street .
The cars disappeared as well .
I ducked .
And only one figure remained in the middle of the road .
So I stopped the car and I went to help .
The man was without legs and only with one arm .
So I took him into a safe place .
&quot; I work , &quot; he said .
I wondered , what work ?
Why don &apos;t you have the artificial legs ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; The Red Cross has closed . &quot;
Well without thinking , I told him &quot; Come tomorrow .
We will provide you with a pair of legs . &quot;
The center is closed , no staff around .
Maybe the machinery is broken .
Who is going to make the legs for him ? &quot;
So I hoped that he would not come .
This is the streets of Kabul in those days .
And I spoke with a gatekeeper .
Nothing can be done .
Give him some money . &quot;
But Mahmoud and his son were already there .
And they were not alone .
There were 15 , maybe 20 , people like him waiting .
And there was some staff too .
Among them there was my right-hand man , Najmuddin .
I said , &quot; No .
We have to go away . We cannot stay here . &quot;
So , &quot; We cannot stay here , it &apos;s dangerous .
It &apos;s not a priority . &quot;
It &apos;s really dangerous .
We have other things to do . &quot;
But they insisted .
So we started doing some repairs .
I was doing something that I was not supposed to do .
Maybe some of them are here now .
So we started .
He was telling me , &quot; Patients are coming . &quot;
But people were coming .
And Mahmoud was coming every day .
And slowly , slowly week after week his legs were improving .
He was coming every day , crossing the front line .
But finally , the great day arrived .
Mahmoud was going to be discharged with his new legs .
It was April , I remember , a very beautiful day .
Very sad , dark .
So we chose a small spot in the garden .
Suddenly , they started fighting .
Two groups of Mujahideen started fighting .
We could hear in the air the bullets passing .
So we dashed , all of us , towards the shelter .
Mahmoud grabbed his son , I grabbed someone else .
Everybody was grabbing something .
And we ran .
And Mahmoud , &quot; Of course I can .
I can run , and now you can go to school .
Later on , we took them home .
And then I understood , physical rehabilitation is a priority .
Dignity cannot wait for better times .
From that day on , we never closed a single day .
I met Mahmoud one year later .
He was in good shape -- a bit thinner .
I asked about his son .
But I understood he wanted to tell me something .
So I asked him , &quot; What is that ? &quot;
He was sweating .
He was clearly embarrassed .
He said , &quot; You have taught me to walk .
Thank you very much .
Now help me not to be a beggar anymore . &quot;
That was the job .
&quot; My children are growing .
I feel ashamed .
I said , &quot; Okay . &quot;
Just to give him some money .
It was the easiest way .
And then he sat down .
I sat down too with goosebumps everywhere .
&quot; What ? &quot; I said , &quot; Stop . &quot;
We need to increase the production . &quot;
&quot; Excuse me ? &quot;
I could not believe .
I said , &quot; Listen , it &apos;s insane .
And it &apos;s even cruel to think of anything like this .
That &apos;s a production line and a very fast one .
But with Najmuddin , we cannot discuss .
I told Najmuddin , &quot; That &apos;s a trick .
I can &apos;t believe it . &quot;
The production was up 20 percent .
And then I asked for verification .
It was true .
The comment of Najmuddin was Mahmoud has something to prove .
I understood that I was wrong again .
Mahmoud had looked taller .
I remember him sitting behind the workbench smiling .
He was a new man , taller again .
He has regained his full dignity thanks to that job .
So of course , I understood .
And you know what ?
It &apos;s good for everybody .
But also for the newcomers .
Sometimes you see them , they look , &quot; Oh . &quot;
And you see the faces .
And then the surprise turns into hope .
Scraps of men do not exist .
People like Mahmoud are agents of change .
And when you start changing , you cannot stop .
And when you start , you cannot stop .
There is always a better way to do things .
That &apos;s Najmuddin , the one with the white coat .
Terrible Najmuddin , is that one .
They are my teachers .
There are plenty of countries at war like Afghanistan .
It is possible and it is not difficult .
This is my big wish .
We transport the wheelchairs everywhere .
We have several teams in the main part of Afghanistan .
I said , &quot; No , &quot; you can imagine .
Is it really necessary ? &quot;
Well now you should see me .
I never miss a single training session .
The night before a match I &apos;m very nervous .
And you should see me during the match .
I shout like a true Italian .
That was my story . Thank you very much .
Pavan Sukhdev : Put a value on nature !
But we need to do something about this problem .
And their basic inspiration was a stern review of Lord Stern .
Why can &apos;t an equivalent case be made for nature ?
And the answer is : Yeah , it can .
But it &apos;s not that straightforward .
So this was comparable in size to that kind of loss .
What is this about ?
A picture that you &apos;re familiar with -- the Amazon rainforests .
And the answer is zilch , exactly zero .
That &apos;s the economic invisibility of nature .
Economics has become the currency of policy .
It completely passes below the radar screen .
But when did a bee actually ever give you an invoice ?
Once again , most of that doesn &apos;t get paid .
They were the ones that didn &apos;t get paid .
That &apos;s the difference .
Because these are important benefits for the poor .
How bad can things get ?
Well here a picture of something called the mean species abundance .
The green represents the percentage .
If it &apos;s yellow , it &apos;s 40 to 60 percent .
See that again .
This is the challenge .
That &apos;s not that hard .
So now look at the different lens .
So is this just a story from South Thailand ?
Sorry , this is a global story .
Use of freshwater .
Can we stop this , and how ?
That has to stop .
I began a project way back called the Green Accounting Project .
And actually we &apos;ve done this with the TEEB project .
So clearly there was a problem with deforestation .
It was associated largely with the construction industry .
Of course , after the event one can be wise .
He &apos;s basically worked the cost to PUMA .
This can be done .
What &apos;s green carbon ?
Today what we have is basically a brown carbon marketplace .
It &apos;s about energy emissions .
The European Union ETS is the main marketplace .
It &apos;s not doing too well . We &apos;ve over-issued .
But that &apos;s all about energy and industry .
More of that in a minute .
So we actually have some movement forward .
But the thing is to do a lot more of that .
Will this solve the problem ? Will economics solve everything ?
Well I &apos;m afraid not .
There is an area that is the oceans , coral reefs .
So that &apos;s almost an eighth of society .
Thank you .
His Holiness the Karmapa : The technology of the heart
All of the plans for me were already made .
I was placed in a pretty strictly controlled environment .
So we spoke and we heard some about design this week .
So it &apos;s an interesting paradox at play there .
His Holiness the Karmapa : Tomorrow is my Talk .
And to you , everyone , thank you very much .
HH : Thank you very much .
Garth Lenz : The true cost of oil
Wetlands globally are one of the most endangered ecosystems .
And the Tombstone Valley is home to the Porcupine caribou herd .
That &apos;s not a bad size home .
Again , imagine those all back and forth there .
How large is that one portion of a mine ?
The other method of extraction is what &apos;s called the in-situ .
The tailings ponds are the largest toxic impoundments on the planet .
So they decided to call it oil sands .
And the tailings ponds range in size up to 9,000 acres .
That &apos;s two-thirds the size of the entire island of Manhattan .
It &apos;s carcinogenic . &quot;
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
The boreal forest sequesters more carbon than any other terrestrial ecosystem .
And this is absolutely key .
This is the infrastructure as we see it about now .
This is what &apos;s planned for 2015 .
Here you see the route down the Mackenzie Valley .
And here we have the plan out to 2030 .
The world does not need any more tar mines .
Thank you so much .
Marco Tempest : The magic of truth and lies
It synchronizes videos across multiple screens of mobile devices .
One of my favorite magicians is Karl Germain .
Ladies and gentlemen , the creation of life .
A magician promises to deceive you -- and he does .
Now I feel bad about that .
But people lie every day .
Hold on .
Girl in Phone : Hey , where are you ?
MT : Stuck in traffic . I &apos;ll be there soon .
You &apos;ve all done it .
It &apos;s just what I &apos;ve always wanted .
You were great .
MT : Deception , it &apos;s a fundamental part of life .
We deceive to gain advantage and to hide our weaknesses .
Oscar Wilde said the same thing of romance .
Some people deceive for money .
Let &apos;s play a game .
Three cards , three chances .
Now where &apos;s the lady ?
Where is the queen ?
MT : This one ?
Sorry . You lose .
Well , I didn &apos;t deceive you .
You deceived yourself .
Self-deception .
Sometimes it &apos;s hard to tell the two apart .
Compulsive gamblers are experts at self-deception .
They believe they can win .
They forget the times they lose .
The brain is very good at forgetting .
Bad experiences are quickly forgotten .
Bad experiences quickly disappear .
That &apos;s &quot; Clair de Lune . &quot;
Thank you . Thank you very much .
Thelma Golden : How art gives shape to cultural change
It &apos;s always what it was and what it can be .
Now , what does this mean to some of you ?
The Studio Museum was founded in the late 60s .
And then , of course , to bring us to today .
In 1975 , Muhammad Ali gave a lecture at Harvard University .
And Mohammed Ali said , &quot; Me , we . &quot;
A profound statement about the individual and the community .
What can artwork say about this ?
It is why I look to art .
It &apos;s why I ask questions of art .
It is why I make exhibitions .
this cultural discourse in an international context .
So , what do I discover when I look at artworks ?
What do I think about when I think about art ?
Thank you .
Isabel Allende : Tales of passion
I &apos;m here to tell you a few tales of passion .
There &apos;s a Jewish saying that I love .
What is truer than truth ? Answer : The story .
Allow me to tell you about my four minutes of fame .
I was told that this was no laughing matter .
A uniform , she said , and asked for my measurements .
My measurements .
Those athletes had sacrificed everything to compete in the games .
Only a fearless and determined heart will get the gold medal .
It is all about passion .
Passion lives here . Isn &apos;t it always true ?
Heart is what drives us and determines our fate .
People like all of you in this room .
Nice people with common sense do not make interesting characters .
They only make good former spouses .
In the green room I received my uniform .
I looked like a refrigerator .
Sophia is over 70 and she looks great .
I don &apos;t know .
Well , she didn &apos;t say that exactly .
All the cameras were , of course , on Sophia .
A place where most men would love to be .
So here &apos;s a tale of passion .
She &apos;s pregnant and a widow .
Two tiny little boys .
Mapendo , in Swahili , means great love .
I look around and I see them everywhere .
I have worked with women and for women all my life .
I know them well .
We had a memorable fight . Feminism is dated ?
They have no control over their bodies or their lives .
They have no education and no freedom .
They are raped , beaten up and sometimes killed with impunity .
Feminism is not dead , by no means .
The year is 2005 .
She risks a lot and she &apos;s terrified .
Jenny has a brave and passionate heart .
She murmurs a prayer and she goes ahead with the operation .
At the end , the relieved patient kisses her hands .
That day the hygienist pulls out many more teeth .
The woman &apos;s face looks like a watermelon .
The husband , furious , threatens to kill the American .
Millions of women live like this today .
They are the poorest of the poor .
Wangari Maathai goes to a village in Kenya .
Women are 51 percent of humankind .
What kind of world do we want ?
This is a fundamental question that most of us are asking .
Does it make sense to participate in the existing world order ?
What I fear most is power with impunity .
I fear abuse of power , and the power to abuse .
I &apos;m talking about men with young minds , of course .
I want to make this world good .
Not better , but to make it good .
Thank you .
Conception to birth -- visualized
I got the data .
And divides anew every 12 to 15 hours .
Early Embryo Yolk sack still feeding Baby .
I &apos;m going to show you something pretty unique .
Here &apos;s a human heart at 25 &#91; weeks &#93; .
It &apos;s just basically two strands .
Then you start to take a look at adult life .
Take a look at this little tuft of capillaries .
It &apos;s just a tiny sub-substructure , microscopic .
I mean , and only one mile is visible .
59,999 miles that are basically bringing nutrients and taking waste away .
Thank you .
Lemon Andersen : Please don &apos;t take my Air Jordans
&quot; My Air Jordans cost a hundred with tax .
My suede Starters jacket says Raiders on the back .
My leather Adidas baseball cap matches my fake Gucci backpack .
Parents say I shouldn &apos;t , but I knows I should .
School &apos;s almost over . Summer is near .
And I &apos;m sportin &apos; torn Jordans .
I need something new . Only one thing left to do .
Maybe I &apos;ll get lucky and find easy prey .
I &apos;m ready and willing . I &apos;m packing my gun .
This is serious business . This ain &apos;t no fun .
And I can &apos;t have my posse laughin &apos; at me .
The red emblem of Michael looked as if it could fly .
Not one spot of dirt . The Airs were brand new .
Had my pistol and knew just what to do .
He was coughing , crying , blood spilled on the street .
And I snatched them Air Jordans off of his feet .
You &apos;d think he &apos;d be worried about staying alive .
Thank you .
&quot; Yo &apos; wack .
You know what the problem is with you , homie ?
Now I could have quit . I should have quit .
I mean , I thought poetry was just self-expression .
I didn &apos;t know you actually have to have creative control .
So instead of quitting , I followed him everywhere .
But that wasn &apos;t the biggest lesson I ever learned .
Because people like me took your job .
Dude , you go to Riker &apos;s Island Academy .
Boards don &apos;t hit back .
Thank you .
Richard St. John : Success is a continuous journey
Why do so many people reach success and then fail ?
And it doesn &apos;t take long to go downhill .
Reaching success , I worked hard , I pushed myself .
I can just sit back and relax . &quot;
I don &apos;t need to improve any more . &quot;
Because I did all these simple things that led to ideas .
And the only thing that came was creative block .
I couldn &apos;t come up with any ideas .
And I got distracted by it .
And reaching success , I always did what I loved .
I bought a fast car .
It didn &apos;t help .
I was faster but just as depressed .
But money can &apos;t buy happiness . &quot;
And he put me on anti-depressants .
And clients didn &apos;t call .
And that was great .
So I went back to doing the projects I loved .
But it wasn &apos;t a quick trip .
It took seven years .
But in the end , business grew bigger than ever .
And I threw it away and haven &apos;t needed it since .
I learned that success isn &apos;t a one-way street .
It &apos;s a continuous journey .
So here is to your continued success .
Thank you very much .
Todd Humphreys : How to fool a GPS
Ironically , hardly anyone noticed at the time .
This level of accuracy has unleashed a firestorm of innovation .
Paper maps are becoming obsolete .
So why don &apos;t we have this capability on our phones ?
Only , I believe , for a lack of imagination .
The Holy Grail , of course , is the GPS dot .
Do you remember the movie &quot; The Da Vinci Code ? &quot;
The GPS dot will do the same for our possessions .
Well , so did I.
&quot; I already have , &quot; she told me .
&quot; I already have , &quot; she replied .
&quot; Okay , what about the FBI ? &quot;
So , there we were .
They get drowned out by the bubble .
So you might be thinking , the Wave Bubble sounds great .
And why is that ?
Well , because it &apos;s not a bubble at all .
Our modern society has a special relationship with GPS .
We &apos;re almost blindly reliant on it .
It &apos;s built deeply into our systems and infrastructure .
Some call it &quot; the invisible utility . &quot;
It might be deadly .
The idea behind the GPS spoofer is simple .
Instead of jamming the GPS signals , you fake them .
So let me show you how this works .
At this point , the game is over .
The fake signals now completely control this GPS receiver .
So is this really possible ?
Well , the short answer is yes .
The key is that civil GPS signals are completely open .
They have no encryption . They have no authentication .
I remember vividly the week it all came together .
They seemed to speak to me .
And &quot; you can trust us . &quot;
So something felt very wrong about the world .
It &apos;s the ultimate weapon against an invasion of GPS dots .
Imagine , for example , you &apos;re being tracked .
Maybe you &apos;ll have a whole bag full of them .
You &apos;ll never lose track of your things again .
The GPS dot will fundamentally reorder your life .
It &apos;ll be fascinating to see how this all turns out .
Thanks .
Phil Borges : Photos of endangered cultures
And this happens every two weeks .
This is Tamdin .
She is a 69-year-old nun .
The Dalai Lama lives in Dharamsala , India .
This is Paldin .
Paldin is a 62-year-old monk .
And he spent 33 years in prison .
I interview and do portraits .
And this is a little girl .
I took her portrait up on top of the Jokhang Temple .
This is Jigme and her sister , Sonam .
This is at 17,000 feet .
And he &apos;s never been back to his country since .
And he still is holding this line .
This is another leader of his people .
This is Moi . This is in the Ecuadorian Amazon .
And Moi is 35 years old .
This was on a monkey hunt , hunting with curare-tipped darts .
This is Mengatoue .
I wish they would just go away .
And then we went up and met their shaman .
And we watched and stayed with John Doolikahn .
And all the security issues they cause us .
We now have 15 sites .
That was one of the big motivating factors .
It was a two million dollar study .
United States came in second to last in geographic knowledge .
We just had a workshop in Guatemala .
Thank you very much .
Gotcha .
Mosquitos . I hate them .
Don &apos;t you ?
But that &apos;s fascinating , right ?
Why does she receive more bites than I do ?
And the answer is smell , the smell of her body .
And this was not going to be an easy task .
And therefore , we set up various experiments .
And we found some remarkable differences .
They had a very strong preference for biting on the face .
That &apos;s right .
And this triggered us to do a remarkable experiment .
And you know what ? It worked .
That &apos;s the cheese , just to show you .
My second story is remarkable as well .
Why ? Because they are just like the CIA .
In that pool of water , these larvae are concentrated .
They &apos;re all together there . They are immobile .
Ooh , that was very quick .
Man &apos;s best friend in the fight against malaria .
Yeah .
Thank you .
Now let me show you how this works .
Just kidding , just kidding .
Here we go .
There we go . Okay .
They don &apos;t kill us . We kill them .
Now — — Maastricht , be prepared .
Now think of what we can do with this .
So cheese , dogs and a pill to kill mosquitos .
Hasan Elahi : FBI , here I am !
Hi there . I &apos;m Hasan . I &apos;m an artist .
or &quot; What kind of medium do you work in ? &quot;
So what I &apos;m really interested in is creative problem solving .
So let me show you a little of that .
So it started over here .
And this is the Detroit airport in June 19th of 2002 .
I was flying back to the U.S. from an exhibition overseas .
&quot; Where were you the 29th ? the 30th ? &quot;
&quot; Where were you October 5th ? &quot;
We read about six months of my calendar .
Furniture that I can &apos;t fit in my ratty apartment .
I was like , &quot; Great . &quot;
So to the folks from Google , thank you .
So I spent a lot of time in this building .
Because you have to base it on a yes or no .
I work at a university .
I was like , &quot; No . &quot;
I know everything &apos;s fine . &quot;
So they &apos;re looking at me really odd .
This is with the FBI .
And there was a sincere concern there .
Just wanted to say , &quot; Hey guys .
Just letting you know . Heads up . &quot;
with pictures , with travel tips .
Then I &apos;d make websites .
So I actually designed this back in 2003 .
So this kind of tracks me at any given moment .
I wrote some code for my mobile phone .
But I &apos;ll watch myself . It &apos;s okay .
You don &apos;t have to waste your energy or your resources .
And I &apos;ll help you out .
This was on Delta 719 going from JFK to San Francisco .
That &apos;s Kennedy airport , May 19th , Tuesday .
This is in Warsaw .
Singapore . You can see , they &apos;re kind of empty .
At Coreana Supermarket buying my kimchi because I like kimchi .
And there &apos;s a verification taking place .
Sometimes they &apos;re really small purchases .
So 34 cents foreign transaction fee .
Sometimes there &apos;s a lot of information .
This is exactly where my old apartment in San Francisco was .
And then sometimes you get this .
I had to tell them every little detail of everything .
I spend a lot of time on the road .
So there &apos;s multiple databases .
And there &apos;s thousands and thousands and thousands of images .
So you get something like this .
So how do you know these are meals eaten at home ?
Well the same plate shows up a whole bunch of times .
So again , you have to do some detective work here .
So sometimes the databases get so specific .
At 11 : 39 a.m. was this one .
So I time-stamp my life every few moments .
Every few moments I shoot the image .
So on December 4th , I went here .
And really , it &apos;s not the most user-friendly interface .
It &apos;s actually quite user-unfriendly .
And you know very little about me actually .
So what do you do when everything is out there ?
Well you have to take control over it .
But if 300 million people in the U.S.
Because it just wouldn &apos;t work if everybody was sharing everything .
And we &apos;re getting to that .
Why are you posting these photos ? &quot;
So we &apos;re creating our own archives and so on .
Because no one &apos;s really watching .
No one &apos;s really going to bother you . &quot;
Because it &apos;s about surveillance .
I &apos;m watching who &apos;s watching me .
And I came up with these .
So these are some of my sample logs .
You can see the National Security Agency likes to come by .
Central Intelligence Agency .
Executive Office of the President .
Not really sure why they show up , but they do .
I think they kind of like to look at art .
So thank you very much . I appreciate it .
Hasan , just curious .
So how many hours of the day does that take ?
HE : Almost none .
It &apos;s no different than sending a text .
It &apos;s no different than checking an email .
So it &apos;s just become another day .
And everything &apos;s automated at the other end .
So it holds onto the very last point .
Hasan , thank you very much .
Joseph Nye : Global power shifts
It really should be called the recovery or return of Asia .
That &apos;s important and it &apos;s an important shift .
Now that &apos;s a big abstract number .
Anybody can play in the game .
The technology was there .
So capabilities that were once restricted are now available to everyone .
The State still matters .
But the stage is crowded .
We think in terms of war and interstate war .
You might think of that as the privatization of war .
So let me step back and ask : what &apos;s power ?
The tectonic plates of world politics were shifting .
by 2027 .
Let me mention three reasons why it &apos;s too simple .
First of all , it &apos;s a linear projection .
History is not linear .
You know , it looks at economic power measured by GDP .
It &apos;s all very one-dimensional .
But you might ask , well so what in any case ?
Why does it matter ? Who cares ?
Is this just a game that diplomats and academics play ?
The answer is it matters quite a lot .
Let me give you an example from history .
What caused it ?
Notice both halves of that explanation .
No , I think that &apos;s wrong .
It &apos;s bad history .
Top board : military power among states .
economic power among states .
Power is multi-polar .
It makes no sense to call this unipolar or multi-polar .
Power is chaotically distributed .
It &apos;s one in which we can all gain .
Now I don &apos;t mean to be Pollyannaish about this .
Wars persist . Power persists .
Military power is important .
Keeping balances is important .
All this still persists .
Hard power is there , and it will remain .
How do we define our national interests but positive sum .
Thank you very much .
David Lang : My underwater robot
So ROVs aren &apos;t new .
They &apos;ve been around for decades .
Scientists use ROVs to explore the oceans .
Oil and gas companies use them for exploration and construction .
What we &apos;ve built isn &apos;t unique .
It &apos;s how we &apos;ve built it that &apos;s really unique .
We kept working on it . We learned a lot .
But then we had to learn how to make them .
I mean , we had to learn small batch manufacturing .
We &apos;ve also learned the penguins love robots .
That &apos;s the only way that we could have done this .
But the actual robot is really only half the story .
So you &apos;re probably all wondering : the cave .
Did you find the gold ?
It was the glimpse into a potential future for ocean exploration .
It &apos;s an underwater world we &apos;re all exploring together .
Thank you .
Daphne Bavelier : Your brain on video games
But let &apos;s be frank .
So video &#91; gaming &#93; is pervasive throughout our society .
Now I want to step back a bit .
Most parents would find that great .
It &apos;s not , and binging is never good .
That &apos;s a statement about vision .
There may be vision scientists among you .
We actually know how to test that statement .
Guess what ? Their vision is really , really good .
It &apos;s better than those that don &apos;t play .
And it &apos;s better in two different ways .
Okay , we know how to measure attention in the lab .
Right ? So this is the first example .
&#91; &quot; Board &quot; &#93; Audience : Red.Daphne Bavelier : Red .
&#91; &quot; Blue &quot; &#93; DB : Yellow .
Okay , you get my point , right ?
Was it yellow initially or blue ?
Yellow or blue ?
Audience : Yellow.DB : Good .
That &apos;s for you guys , action video game players .
A bit more challenging , right ?
That &apos;s a multimedia-tasker .
The first one is that not all media are created equal .
Different video games have a different effect on your brains .
The other lesson is that general wisdom carries no weight .
That &apos;s the point of rehabilitation or education .
And one more step is to do training studies .
Okay , I &apos;ll help you . Fourth one .
One more . Get those brains working . Come on .
That &apos;s our target shape .
Third . Good ! This is hard , right ?
It doesn &apos;t really feel like playing mindless action video games .
That &apos;s the chocolate side of the equation .
Who really wants to eat chocolate-covered broccoli ?
Einstein the Parrot : A talking , squawking parrot
Can you tell everybody your name ?
Einstein : Einstein .
E : Hello .
SW : That &apos;s nice . Can you be polite ?
E : Hi , sweetheart .
E : Woo .
SW : Yeah .
E : &#91; Squawks &#93; SW : Yeah .
Einstein &apos;s especially interested in Penelope &apos;s talk .
E : Achoo !
Einstein : &#91; Coughs &#93; SW : Yeah .
SW : Yeah . She would get really , really excited .
She thinks Burt Rutan is very impressive .
E : Ooh .
Einstein , would you like to ride in Burt &apos;s spaceship ?
It would be very dangerous if you fell down .
E : Wheeeeeee ! &#91; Splat &#93; SW : Yeah .
E : Ow , ow , ow .
Can you get down ?
Einstein : Ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh .
SW : Do your head now .
E : Ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh .
E : &#91; Operatic squawk &#93; SW : Very good .
Or maybe Stu just needs another backup singer ?
Einstein , can you also sing ?
E : La , la .
E : What &apos;s the matter ?
E : Yar .
E : Beer .
You like to drink water .
She thinks Al Gore is a really good-looking man .
What do you say to a good-looking man ?
E : Hey , baby .
E : Yee haw .
Can you sing &quot; Happy Birthday &quot; to him ?
E : Happy birthday to you .
SW : Again .
E : Happy birthday to you .
SW : Again .
E : Happy birthday to you .
SW : Big finish .
E : Happy birthday to you .
SW : Good job !
E : Woo , woo , woo .
SW : What about the other birds ?
E : Tweet , tweet , tweet .
SW : And the penguin ?
E : Quack , quack , quack .
SW : There we go .
SW : Very good .
What about a wolf ?
E : Ooooowww .
SW : And a pig ?
E : Oink , oink , oink .
SW : And the rooster ?
E : Cock-a-doodle-doo !
SW : And how about those cats ?
E : Meow .
E : Grrrrr .
SW : What about a skunk ?
E : Stinker .
E : Superstar .
SW : Yeah . You are a superstar .
Now , Einstein does say it best when we ask her .
Why do we want to protect your home ?
E : I &apos;m special .
E : I love you .
E : Goodbye .
SW : Good job . Thank you all .
Jacek Utko : Can design save newspapers ?
Newspapers are dying for a few reasons .
And we should save trees in the end .
So it &apos;s enough to bury any industry .
There are several scenarios for the future newspaper .
It should be opinion-driven ; less news , more views .
Sounds nice , but this can only buy time .
So what can we do ?
Let me tell you my story .
I said , &quot; I &apos;m designing newspapers . &quot;
The front page became our signature .
It was my personal intimate channel to talk to the readers .
My approach was very egotistic .
I wanted my artistic statement , my interpretation of reality .
I wanted to make posters , not newspapers .
Not even magazines : posters .
Soon it started to bring results .
But it &apos;s not only about the front page .
And music has a rhythm , has ups and downs .
And design is responsible for this experience .
But the real award came from Society for Newspaper Design .
And two years later , the same award came to Estonia .
Isn &apos;t amazing ?
But the real hit was in Bulgaria .
And that is really amazing .
Did design do this ?
Design was just a part of the process .
And I put strategy at the top of it .
Then we adjust the content accordingly .
And then , usually after two months , we start designing .
My bosses , in the beginning , were very surprised .
So what is the lesson behind it ?
It can even change you .
And who &apos;s responsible ? Designers .
Give power to designers .
But the second is even more important .
You can live in a small poor country , like me .
And everybody can do it .
You just need inspiration , vision and determination .
Thank you .
Shaka Senghor : Why your worst deeds don &apos;t define you
But that wasn &apos;t the end of my story .
The actual events are pretty straightforward .
My friend rushed me to the hospital .
I didn &apos;t want to take responsibility .
I blamed everybody from my parents to the system .
And I found myself getting deeper and deeper into trouble .
He said , &quot; Dad , don &apos;t kill .
Jesus watches what you do . Pray to Him . &quot;
At that point is when the transformation began .
But it didn &apos;t come easy .
The first thing was , I had great mentors .
The second thing was literature .
The third thing was family .
The final thing was writing .
That was pretty much what my life was like .
But the thing that fascinated me the most was phone technology .
And I was like , &quot; What is K ? &quot;
And he was like , &quot; K is okay . &quot;
And so I text him a question mark .
And he said , &quot; K = okay . &quot;
And so I tap back , &quot; FU . &quot;
He served 24 years for a crime he didn &apos;t commit .
I had to acknowledge that I had hurt others .
I also had to acknowledge that I had been hurt .
The second thing was apologizing .
I had to apologize to the people I had hurt .
But I also had to apologize to myself .
The third thing was atoning .
Thank you .
I was born and raised in North Korea .
But then the great famine began in 1994 .
I was four years old .
Hunger is humiliation . Hunger is hopelessness .
I saw my father wither away and die .
I have not seen my mom or my sister since then .
Suddenly , I became an orphan and homeless .
My daily life became very hard , but very simple .
But that is no way to survive .
I started to realize , begging would not be the solution .
So I started to steal from food carts in illegal markets .
Sometimes , I found small jobs in exchange for food .
I was not uncommon .
Many other orphans survived this way , or worse .
That hope kept me alive .
I don &apos;t mean big , grand hope .
Hope kept me alive .
I realized I couldn &apos;t survive much longer this way .
I made it to China on February 15 , 2006 .
I was 16 years old .
I thought more people would help me .
I was always worried about being caught and sent back .
Even in North Korea , I was an F student .
And I barely finished elementary school .
Textbooks and the library were not my playground .
At one point , my father gave up on me .
He said , &quot; You &apos;re not my son anymore . &quot;
I didn &apos;t even go to middle school .
I was so happy .
I looked at him sitting next to me .
Suddenly I remembered my biological father .
That chicken wing changed my life .
You have to choose to believe in hope .
You have to make it yourself .
In North Korea , I made it myself .
Hope brought me to America .
I did not come here by myself .
I had hope , but hope by itself is not enough .
Many people helped me along the way to get here .
North Koreans are fighting hard to survive .
This is my message to you .
Have hope for yourself , but also help each other .
Life can be hard for everyone , wherever you live .
My foster father didn &apos;t intend to change my life .
Thank you .
Joseph Kim : In Korean ?
AH : You can do English , then Korean as well .
And I -- oh , gosh .
I still haven &apos;t given up my hope to see you .
And can I also make a small message to my mom ?
AH : Sure , please .
Thank you .
Sleepy Man Banjo Boys : Teen wonders play bluegrass
TM : Thank you , thank you .
Robbie Mizzone : Thank you .
And on guitar is my 14-year-old brother , Tommy .
We call ourselves the Sleepy Man Banjo Boys .
TM : Thank you .
JM : Thank you all .
TM : Thank you very much .
David Perry : Are games better than life ?
This was me running around in the back garden mid-summer .
I couldn &apos;t pick a career .
My mother wanted me to be a dentist .
But the problem was that people kept blowing everything up .
And this was a pretty common sight .
The school I went to was pretty boring .
They forced us to learn things like Latin .
And that was the finishing post right there .
So this was extremely embarrassing .
So I brought a picture with big hair .
I just want to get that out of the way .
And -- you see the picture at the bottom ?
That &apos;s what they thought they had built it for .
The graphics were just horrible .
But of course the scientists couldn &apos;t help themselves .
They started making their own video games .
And that &apos;s what it looked like .
Here &apos;s Clive Sinclair now launching his color computer .
That was much better .
It grows every year .
Last year was the biggest year .
By 2010 , we &apos;re going to hit 42 billion .
43 percent of gamers are female .
The average age of gamers ?
Well , obviously it &apos;s for children , right ?
Well , no , actually it &apos;s 30 years old .
So 37 is our target audience .
All video games are violent .
Of course the newspapers love to beat on this .
Online gaming statistics .
It makes about 80 million bucks a month in subscriptions .
You have to remember that this is not a real island .
He didn &apos;t actually buy anything , just some data .
But he got great terms on it .
This market is now estimated at over 800 million dollars annually .
That &apos;s what the show looks like .
It &apos;s very , very epic and a very beautiful concert .
And the people that went there absolutely loved it .
What do you think these people are doing ?
And this is happening in every city around the world .
And I &apos;m going to show you up to maybe 2007 .
So we &apos;re going to start that video .
Throughout human history people have played games .
You need to be really an incredible artist .
So I &apos;d like to play this video .
I &apos;m a video game addict and this is my story .
Most of my childhood was spent playing with Legos .
At some point something clicked .
It became an alternate existence , my virtual reality .
I know I can .
We are interacting with our entertainment .
I have come to expect this level of interaction .
Their importance blends into the sensationalized drama of prime time TV .
The people who create these games are smart .
Then they use these emotions to dimensionalize the worlds they create .
I know what I want and I do it .
I know violent video games make my mother worry .
These are all troubles outside of myself .
I , however , have a problem very close to home .
Something has happened to my brain .
The sensory cues are very similar .
For my virtual worlds are perfect .
More beautiful and rich than the real world around us .
But maybe brainwashing isn &apos;t always bad .
There is a potential to do good as well .
I know that I am losing my grip .
Part of me is just waiting to let go .
DP : Wow .
The most important one being fun .
Who is that going to come from ?
I don &apos;t think so .
That means there &apos;s literally thousands of new ideas .
You &apos;re off , you &apos;re off . That &apos;s it .
He &apos;s out of time .
Go ahead . I &apos;m going to stay right here though .
And as I &apos;ve shown here , we have the audience .
You know , we have the technology .
I just hope she likes video games .
So , my closing thought .
Where better to challenge those minds than here at TED ?
Thank you .
David Perry . That was awesome .
Hans Rosling : The magic washing machine
That was a great day for my mother .
And Grandma was even more excited .
And now she was going to watch electricity do that work .
Let me , let me push the button . &quot;
I want to see this ! Give me a chair !
She was mesmerized .
To my grandmother , the washing machine was a miracle .
Look , the homes are full of machines .
I can &apos;t even name them all .
And they consume more than $ 40 per day .
So two billion have access to washing machines .
And the remaining five billion , how do they wash ?
Because it remains hard work for women to wash .
They wash like this : by hand .
And they want the washing machine .
They want the washing machine in exactly the same way .
And no one raised their hand .
Even the hardcore in the green movement use washing machines .
Here we are .
This group uses three , one each .
And they also have electricity .
And over there they don &apos;t even use one each .
That makes 12 of them .
First , population growth .
Second , economic growth .
What will happen is economic growth .
&quot; Wopp ! &quot; they will say .
And these people , they want the washing machine .
I told you . They &apos;ll go there .
And they will double their energy use .
But the total energy consumption will increase to 22 units .
So what needs to be done ?
It &apos;s real .
Of course they must be more energy-efficient .
They must change behavior in some way .
Here we can get more green energy all over .
This is what we hope may happen .
It &apos;s a real challenge in the future .
If you have democracy , people will vote for washing machines .
They love them .
And what &apos;s the magic with them ?
The machine will make the work .
And now we can go to the library . &quot;
You get books out of the machines , children &apos;s books .
And mother got time to read for me .
And she also got books for herself .
And we really , we really loved this machine .
Thank you steel mill .
Thank you power station .
Thank you very much .
Jon Ronson : Strange answers to the psychopath test
It lists every known mental disorder .
And it lists currently 374 mental disorders .
I &apos;ve got generalized anxiety disorder , which is a given .
I &apos;m kidding . I &apos;m not kidding .
I &apos;m kidding .
And I &apos;ve got malingering .
Which is how I ended up having lunch with the Scientologists .
They &apos;re called the CCHR .
And I said , &quot; How ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Who &apos;s Tony ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; Tony &apos;s in Broadmoor . &quot;
Now Broadmoor is Broadmoor Hospital .
And he said , &quot; Hardly anything .
So I said , &quot; Yes , please . &quot;
So I got the train to Broadmoor .
And we got to Broadmoor .
It looks like a giant Hampton Inn .
It &apos;s all peach and pine and calming colors .
And the patients started drifting in .
And then Brian said , &quot; Here &apos;s Tony . &quot;
And a man was walking in .
And he sat down .
Fake madness .
Nurses will bring you pizzas .
He said , &quot; I asked to see the prison psychiatrist .
Anyway he faked madness too well , he said .
And they didn &apos;t send him to some cushy hospital .
They sent him to Broadmoor .
I &apos;m not mentally ill . &quot;
I &apos;ve been in Broadmoor for 12 years . &quot;
But how do you sit in a sane way ?
How do you cross your legs in a sane way ?
It &apos;s just impossible . &quot;
Am I crossing my legs like a journalist ? &quot;
And they take that as a sign of madness .
They say it proves that I &apos;m aloof and grandiose . &quot;
I said , &quot; What &apos;s the story ? &quot;
However , we have assessed him .
It &apos;s on the checklist : cunning and manipulative .
He was a psychopath .
So I did .
So there &apos;s 1,500 people in his room .
Fifteen of you are psychopaths .
It could be carnage by the end of the night .
Who cares ? That &apos;s not a big story .
You want to go and interview yourself some corporate psychopaths . &quot;
And they didn &apos;t reply .
So I changed tack .
And he said , &quot; Come on over . &quot;
There were lions and tigers .
He was taking me through the garden .
There were falcons and eagles .
He was saying this in a less effeminate way .
It was like Narnia .
And then we went into his kitchen .
Now Al Dunlap would be brought in to save failing companies .
He &apos;d close down 30 percent of the workforce .
And he &apos;d quite often fire people with a joke .
He said , &quot; Yeah , it &apos;s an amazing theory .
And I said , &quot; A psychopath . &quot;
Can I go through them with you ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Manipulative . &quot;
He said , &quot; That &apos;s leadership . &quot;
He said no to many short-term marital relationships .
He &apos;s only ever been married twice .
I was desperate to define him by his maddest edges .
It &apos;s what all journalists do .
And we stitch them together like medieval monks .
And we leave the normal stuff on the floor .
And this is a country that over-diagnoses certain mental disorders hugely .
When I got back to London , Tony phoned me .
And he said , &quot; I &apos;m not a psychopath . &quot;
He said , &quot; I &apos;ve got a tribunal coming up .
Will you come to it ? &quot;
So I said okay .
So I went to his tribunal .
And after 14 years in Broadmoor , they let him go .
So they let him go .
Everyone &apos;s a bit psychopathic . &quot;
And for the last 20 months everything was fine .
Nothing bad happened .
He was living with a girl outside London .
And then he phoned me .
Because you shouldn &apos;t define people by their maddest edges .
And what Tony is , is he &apos;s a semi-psychopath .
And I didn &apos;t go . What would you have done ?
Thank you .
The microbes on your skin can help boost your immune system .
And I believe the answer is yes .
I like to think of bathrooms like a tropical rainforest .
And that is exactly what we found .
I am collaborating with Charlie Brown .
He &apos;s dedicated his life to sustainable design .
There &apos;s a new microbe , I just discovered it .
Thank you .
Philippe Starck : Design and destiny
You will understand nothing with my type of English .
I mean , I feel useless .
I don &apos;t know .
I don &apos;t try to design the toothbrush .
That doesn &apos;t interest me .
Because there is different types of design .
I call that the cynical design .
What civilization creates this society ?
What animal species creates this civilization ?
Me , I have strictly no power to change anything .
There is things to see , there is the big challenge .
The big challenge in front of us .
Our poetry is our mutation , our life .
Voice offstage : Four point five .
We was so , so stupid . The most stupid bacteria .
Fantastic ! It &apos;s a beauty !
Can you imagine ? It &apos;s very symbolic .
And this territory is fantastic .
That is our poetry . That is our beautiful story .
It &apos;s our romanticism . Mu-ta-tion . We are mutants .
Because every generation thinks we are the final one .
Something like that . I am not sure of that .
Because that is our intelligence of mutation and things like that .
We can say that .
I can explain you . I shall try .
And you will fall , and you will die . Dangerous .
You , you survive . It &apos;s OK .
I live in society ; I live in community .
From this to here , that , it &apos;s genius .
Ptolemy , Eratosthenes , Einstein , things like that .
Nobody &apos;s obliged to be a genius .
It &apos;s better , but nobody .
Come back . Because , after , there is another trap .
It &apos;s called schizophrenia , and you are dead also .
Out , more of the horizontal . You are an intelligence .
Never forget -- like that , like that .
It &apos;s very , very , very important .
This line of evolution is clearly positive .
From far , this line looks very smooth , like that .
It &apos;s made of light and shadow .
We can say light is civilization , shadow is barbaria .
And it &apos;s very important to know where we are .
In this case , people like me are acceptable .
We can say , &quot; It &apos;s luxurious time . &quot;
It &apos;s OK . We are in the light .
With many , many , many , many face of barbaria .
There is different type of barbaria .
That &apos;s why we must adapt .
Forget all that . There is priority ; there is urgency .
You must go back to fight , to battle .
Because it &apos;s not the right time .
And because we must all work to finish this story .
We have just to finish the story .
That is very , very important .
And you can fall , and it &apos;s very dangerous .
No , you must really understand that .
Because we have almost finished , I &apos;ll repeat this story .
We give you white pages . Invent .
Cesar Kuriyama : One second every day
So , I &apos;m an artist .
It &apos;s difficult , sometimes , to pick that one second .
They &apos;re not even enjoying the show .
They &apos;re watching the concert through their cell phone .
And it just takes a quick , quick second .
I was on a three-month road trip this summer .
It really helps you appreciate the good times .
I started a rule of first person perspective .
I turned 31 last week , which is there .
I think everyone would have a different interpretation of it .
Thank you .
Sean Carroll : Distant time and the hint of a multiverse
The universe is really big .
We live in a galaxy , the Milky Way Galaxy .
There are approximately a hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe .
100 billion is the only number you need to know .
Which tells you something about our place in the universe .
It &apos;s extremely beautiful .
But we would also like to understand it .
So we say the universe is expanding .
If you squeeze things together , the temperature goes up .
That kind of makes sense to us .
You might think that that &apos;s not a surprise .
The air in this room is very smooth .
In particular , things were a lot denser .
There is something that made it that way .
We would like to know what .
And Boltzmann &apos;s contribution was that he helped us understand entropy .
You &apos;ve heard of entropy .
That &apos;s a wonderful insight , but it leaves something out .
We &apos;d like to understand that .
That &apos;s our job as cosmologists .
So that &apos;s our job .
We learned that it &apos;s accelerating .
The universe is not only expanding .
If you look at the galaxy , it &apos;s moving away .
It &apos;s just the idea that empty space itself has energy .
For one thing , the universe will expand forever .
Some people thought that the universe would recollapse in the future .
Einstein was fond of this idea .
Finally , empty space has a temperature .
The energy of empty space brings to life quantum fluctuations .
Well what is the implication of that ?
That implication was studied by Boltzmann back in the 19th century .
But that &apos;s a probabilistic statement .
It will probably increase , and the probability is enormously huge .
It &apos;s very , very unlikely .
Remember , life itself depends on the arrow of time .
But there will also be large fluctuations .
That &apos;s the region where entropy is low .
But he was not right .
So this scenario makes predictions .
This scenario predicts that we should be a minimal fluctuation .
And Feynman also understood this .
We therefore conclude the universe is not a fluctuation . &quot;
I just showed you this picture .
It &apos;s cooling off .
They will fall into black holes .
The future is much longer than the past .
But even black holes don &apos;t last forever .
That empty space lasts essentially forever .
So here &apos;s two questions for you .
Why aren &apos;t we in empty space ?
You could be a random fluctuation out of the nothingness .
Why aren &apos;t you ?
More homework assignment for you .
I &apos;m going to give you my favorite scenario .
Either it &apos;s just like that . There is no explanation .
Maybe the universe comes out of a universal chicken .
That &apos;s my favorite scenario .
So the organizers asked me to end with a bold speculation .
This is a prediction . I might be wrong .
Thank you .
Al Seckel : Visual illusions that show how we think
OK . We can violate your expectations about shape .
And figure goes to ground .
And for the musicians .
Pianist transforms to violinist .
William Kamkwamba : How I built a windmill
William , hi . Good to see you .
William Kamkwamba : Thanks .
Where ? What country ?
OK . Now , you &apos;re 19 now ?
WK : Yeah . I &apos;m 19 years now .
Five years ago you had an idea . What was that ?
WK : I wanted to make a windmill .
A windmill ?
WK : Yeah .
What , to power -- for lighting and stuff ?
WK : Yeah .
So what did you do ? How did you realize that ?
And I tried , and I made it .
WK : Ah , no . I just -- What happened ?
The book had three , yours had four .
WK : Yeah .
And you made it out of what ?
OK .
WK : Yeah .
You tested three , and found that four worked better ?
WK : Yeah . I test .
And what did you make the windmill out of ?
What materials did you use ?
WK : Yeah . The windmill .
And so , and that windmill , what -- it worked ?
WK : When the wind blows , it rotates and generates .
How much electricity ?
WK : 12 watts .
WK : Four bulbs and two radios .
Wow .
WK : Yeah .
Next slide -- so who &apos;s that ?
WK : This is my parents , holding the radio .
WK : Yeah .
So this one would have to be bigger ?
WK : Yeah .
How big ?
So that would produce irrigation for the entire village ?
WK : Yeah .
Thank you so much for coming .
WK : Thank you .
Jack Choi : On the virtual dissection table
So we call this Anatomage Table .
I &apos;m going to do some demonstrations .
I &apos;m going to do some cuts .
Then it &apos;s going to show inside .
And I can change my cut to see different parts .
You can see some internal organs .
So we call this the slicer mode .
OK , I &apos;m going to do another cut .
Right there .
This shows a lot of internal structures .
Like this .
So our doctors said these are eye candies .
Right here .
the liver right here .
OK .
Let &apos;s say I &apos;m interested in looking at the heart .
I &apos;m going to do some surgery here .
I &apos;m going to cut some veins , arteries .
Oops ! ...
But fortunately , our digital man has &quot; undo . &quot;
Okay .
All right then .
Let me zoom in .
I &apos;m going to make a cut right there .
And then you can see the inside of the heart .
It doesn &apos;t have to be always dissection .
Since it &apos;s digital , we can do reverse dissection .
Yep .
Maybe I can add quickly this way .
And I can build muscles gradually , just like that .
We can see tendons and muscles .
Wish I could build my muscle this fast .
And this is another way to learn anatomy .
It looks like our table also can transform gender , too .
It &apos;s a female now .
So this is Anatomage Table . Thank you .
Helen Fisher : Why we love , why we cheat
&quot; What &apos; tis to love ? &quot; Shakespeare said .
George Bernard Shaw said it a little differently .
And indeed , that &apos;s what we do .
And then you just focus on this person .
As Chaucer said , &quot; Love is blind . &quot;
You aggrandize them . But you have intense energy .
You &apos;re up all night . You &apos;re walking till dawn .
Real dependence on this person .
Simple . Romantic love is very simple .
You become extremely sexually possessive .
The other main characteristic is motivation .
And last but not least , it is an obsession .
But my most important question was always the same .
And my final question was always the same .
And , indeed , these people would say &quot; Yes ! &quot;
as if I had asked them to pass the salt .
I was just staggered by it .
And we found activity in a lot of brain regions .
And indeed , that &apos;s exactly what happens .
I began to realize that romantic love is not an emotion .
The motor of the brain . It &apos;s a drive .
One is the sex drive : the craving for sexual gratification .
It keeps bothering you a little bit , like being hungry .
It can be focused on nobody .
The first is women working , moving into the workforce .
It &apos;s very slow .
For every trend on this planet , there &apos;s a counter-trend .
And , indeed , that caravan is moving on .
Women are moving back into the job market .
The double income family was the standard .
In short , we &apos;re really moving forward to the past .
Then , women &apos;s worst invention was the plow .
And it &apos;s going to have an impact .
But we did not evolve to have the same brain .
Women can talk .
And , indeed , they &apos;re becoming a very powerful force .
And I think that the television is like the global campfire .
We sit around it and it shapes our minds .
They &apos;ve got incredible people skills , negotiating skills .
They &apos;re highly imaginative .
They tend to be web thinkers .
They &apos;re both perfectly good ways of thinking .
We need both of them to get ahead .
When the male brain works well , it works extremely well .
Foremost , women are starting to express their sexuality .
&quot; Oh , well -- men are more adulterous ! &quot;
And -- basic math !
Anyway .
We are seeing the rise of female sexual expression .
We &apos;re also returning to an ancient form of marriage equality .
We &apos;re also seeing a rise of romantic love .
It may decline some more .
However , there &apos;s always kinds of complications in this .
They can go together , by the way .
That &apos;s why casual sex isn &apos;t so casual .
With orgasm you get a spike of dopamine .
I think the happiness we find , we make .
So I want to conclude with two things .
The worry is about antidepressants .
And these drugs are going generic .
They are seeping around the world .
They want to commit suicide or kill somebody else .
I would recommend it .
Everybody knows that .
Dopamine is associated with romantic love .
And when you kill the sex drive , you kill orgasm .
The things are connected in the brain .
So now -- -- thank you .
They said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Timing is important . Proximity is important .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m now contributing to this .
I &apos;ve been carrying on here about the biology of love .
That &apos;s where we put our people in the MRI machine .
And they were all at a conference in Beijing .
And , &quot; Wasn &apos;t that rickshaw driver handsome ! &quot;
There &apos;s magic to love !
These circuits are deeply embedded in the human brain .
Thank you .
Brian Skerry : The ocean &apos;s glory -- and horror
And the ice that is there is quite thin .
This ended up becoming a cover story at National Geographic .
And it received quite a bit of attention .
These are the tuna , the billfish and the sharks .
These are the lions and tigers of the sea .
I didn &apos;t want them to be overly threatening or scary .
It &apos;s a very solitary creature .
You know , we know almost nothing about them .
This is a very sort of un-shark-like photograph .
One such story I did documented the leatherback sea turtle .
These are animals whose lineage dates back about 100 million years .
And today , they crawl out and see condominiums .
Only one in a thousand leatherback hatchlings will reach maturity .
You can see the coal burning plant in the background .
They also get entangled in fishing gear .
And those white markings are not natural markings .
These are entanglement scars .
They hold on to them , and it eventually kills them .
And the other problem is they get hit by ships .
I went down there in the winter time .
And that &apos;s because the urchins eat kelp .
Little blue cod swimming in for a dash of color .
So I think the message is clear .
Thank you very much .
Nathalie Miebach : Art made of storms
I find weather extremely fascinating .
All of my work begins very simple .
That &apos;s both historical as well as real data .
These clipboards are filled with numbers .
That begins my translation process .
My translation medium is a very simple basket .
A basket is made up of horizontal and vertical elements .
What I come up with are forms like these .
The vertical elements are assigned a specific hour of the day .
So all the way around , you have a 24-hour timeline .
But it &apos;s also used to assign a temperature range .
I also translate weather data into musical scores .
So all of these scores are made up of weather data .
And together , these variables construct a score .
I use these scores to collaborate with musicians .
And not everyone has a Ph.D. in science .
So for me , that was my way into it .
Thank you .
David Hoffman : What happens when you lose everything
I had a fire nine days ago .
It &apos;s gone .
I mean , this was -- was I my things ?
I always live in the present -- I love the present .
I cherish the future .
You &apos;ve got to make something good out of something bad .
That &apos;s my papers .
That was in minutes -- 20 minutes .
Epiphany hit me . Something hit me .
That &apos;s me at my desk .
That was a desk took 40-some years to build .
You know -- all the stuff .
That &apos;s my daughter , Jean .
She came . She &apos;s a nurse in San Francisco .
&quot; Dig it up , &quot; I said . &quot; Pieces .
I want pieces . Bits and pieces . &quot;
It &apos;s the only copy I had . Pieces of it .
Idea about women .
You could cry about this . &quot; I really didn &apos;t .
That &apos;s Arthur Leipzig &apos;s original photograph I loved .
I mean , this was 16-millimeter safety film .
The negatives are gone .
That &apos;s my daughter and me .
That &apos;s my house .
My family &apos;s living in the Hilton Hotel in Scotts Valley .
My children , Davey and Henry .
My son , Davey , in the hotel two nights ago .
I came to live it , and I am living it .
Thank you everybody .
Geraldine Hamilton : Body parts on a chip
We seem to be spending more and more money .
More money , less drugs . Hmm .
So what &apos;s going on here ?
And we have two main tools available at our disposal .
They are cells in dishes and animal testing .
So , cells are happily functioning in our bodies .
Guess what . They don &apos;t .
What about animal testing ?
Well , animals do and can provide extremely useful information .
They teach us about what happens in the complex organism .
We learn more about the biology itself .
So we need better tools .
Our bodies are dynamic environments .
We &apos;re in constant motion .
Our cells experience that .
They &apos;re in dynamic environments in our body .
They &apos;re under constant mechanical forces .
And at the Wyss Institute , we &apos;ve done just that .
We call it an organ-on-a-chip .
And I have one right here .
And it &apos;s not just beautiful .
It can do a tremendous amount of things .
They &apos;ve tried many different approaches .
They &apos;ve even tried to grow little mini-organs in the lab .
We &apos;re not trying to do that here .
So how does it work ? Let me show you .
We have three fluidic channels .
And they experience them how they did in the body .
We can get incredible functionality inside these little chips .
Let me show you .
then we can add human white blood cells .
It &apos;s the way we respond to -- an immune response .
It &apos;s pretty exciting .
Yeah . Mucus . Yuck .
But mucus is actually very important .
And that can lead to diseases such as bronchitis .
We didn &apos;t stop with the lung on a chip .
We have a gut on a chip .
You can see one right here .
This is a disease that affects a large number of individuals .
Now we &apos;re really getting excited .
Does it change the beating of your heart ?
Does it have a toxicity ?
Does it get cleared by the liver ?
Is it metabolized in the liver ?
Is it excreted in your kidneys ?
Tends to be middle aged , tends to be female .
Children are not adults .
They may not respond in the same way adults do .
This could really change the way we do clinical trials .
We &apos;re really seeing something quite incredible at the Wyss Institute .
It &apos;s pretty exciting .
And this is key to the potential of that technology .
Now let me show you our instrument .
It does something else that &apos;s very important .
It creates an easy user interface .
Plug and play . Easy .
It would be a personalized chip just for you .
So how do we prevent them ?
Personalized medicine . Thank you .
Dale Dougherty : We are makers
I really believe that .
All of us are makers .
We &apos;re born makers .
We don &apos;t just live , but we make .
We create things .
Apparently it can .
They don &apos;t always even know why they &apos;re doing it .
We have begun organizing makers at our Maker Faire .
I might get one of those .
Dale Dougherty : These are electric muffins .
Where did you guys get those ?
Muffin : Will you glide with us ?
DD : I know Ford has new electric vehicles coming out .
We got there first .
Lady : Will you glide with us ?
That &apos;s the experience of a clever ride .
And of course , we have fashion .
People are remaking things into fashion .
Now this one takes a little bit of explaining .
You know what those are , right ?
Billy-Bob , or Billy Bass , or something like that .
So , are you a maker ?
And again , think about it .
Makers are in control .
They want to use it to their own purpose .
They &apos;re not mainstream .
They &apos;re a little bit radical .
They &apos;re a bit subversive in what they do .
It was not something you &apos;d even remark upon .
And I found this old video .
And I &apos;ll tell you more about it , but just ...
Of all things Americans are , we are makers .
Makers and shapers and put-it-togetherers .
It didn &apos;t just exist .
And I think that &apos;s tremendously important .
This is Andrew Archer .
Andrew had moved to Detroit from Duluth , Minnesota .
He liked to take things apart .
And he began building robots .
And that &apos;s why he moved to Michigan .
And this kind of gets to this important idea today .
And there &apos;s about three hackerspaces or more in Detroit .
But essentially these are people that are playing with technology .
Let me say that again : playing .
It &apos;s a micro-controller .
Now here &apos;s something -- a 3D printer .
This is Makerbot .
And there are industrial versions of this -- about 20,000 dollars .
Isn &apos;t that cool ?
So makers harvest technology from all the places around us .
And they do interesting things .
Fascinating work they &apos;re doing .
This is Steve Wozniak . Where does he learn about computers ?
It &apos;s the Homebrew Computer Club -- just like a hackerspace .
Well he did a little bit better than free .
An the answer to the question : what will America make ?
It &apos;s more makers .
Thank you very much .
Michael Pawlyn : Using nature &apos;s genius in architecture
I &apos;d like to start with a couple of quick examples .
These are spinneret glands on the abdomen of a spider .
The nearest we &apos;ve come is with aramid fiber .
It does suggest we &apos;ve still got a bit to learn .
This beetle can detect a forest fire at 80 kilometers away .
That &apos;s roughly 10,000 times the range of man-made fire detectors .
Firstly , radical increases in resource efficiency .
And let &apos;s start with radical increases in resource efficiency .
So we started exploring this material called ETFE .
It &apos;s a high-strength polymer .
So that was a factor-100 saving .
Nature works very differently .
It was ending up in landfills .
And I &apos;m just going to talk through this animation .
So they were paid to collect it from the restaurants .
Some of you may recognize this .
The converse is also true .
And those bumps are hydrophilic ; they attract water .
Between them there &apos;s a waxy finish which repels water .
We &apos;re working with the guy who invented the Seawater Greenhouse .
So our energy problems are not intractable .
It &apos;s a challenge to our ingenuity .
CSP needs a supply of demineralized freshwater .
That &apos;s exactly what the Seawater Greenhouse produces .
CSP produces a lot of waste heat .
So this is how this scheme would look .
The next thing is sodium chloride .
This is a hotel in Bolivia .
And it &apos;s pushing the ecosystem close to collapse .
They &apos;re not just possible ; they &apos;re critical .
But here it &apos;s about synergies and abundance and optimizing .
And this is an important point .
Thank you .
Neil Pasricha : The 3 A &apos;s of awesome
My mom left Nairobi , Kenya .
My dad left a small village outside of Amritsar , India .
And they got here in the late 1960s .
We had close family , good friends , a quiet street .
We grew up , and we grew older .
I went to high school .
I graduated .
Life was pretty good .
2006 was a great year .
2007 was a great year .
2008 and 2009 were a little tougher .
First of all , the news was so heavy .
I spoke to him on the phone at 10 : 30 p.m.
on a Sunday night .
We talked about the TV show we watched that evening .
And Monday morning , I found out that he disappeared .
Very sadly , he took his own life .
And it was a really heavy time .
And nobody read it except for my mom .
It started getting bigger and bigger and bigger .
I was like , that sounds totally fake .
So let &apos;s talk about those three As .
They are Attitude , Awareness and Authenticity .
I &apos;d love to just talk about each one briefly .
Your mom could get cancer , your dad could get mean .
The second &quot; A &quot; is Awareness .
I love hanging out with three year-olds .
Because you all used to be three years old .
That three-year-old boy is still part of you .
That three-year-old girl is still part of you .
They &apos;re in there .
The last &quot; A &quot; is Authenticity .
He &apos;s number 76 in the picture .
Here he is pictured with the &quot; fearsome foursome . &quot;
But Rosey Grier also had another passion .
In his deeply authentic self , he also loved needlepoint .
He loved knitting .
That &apos;s what he said .
It &apos;s a great cover .
If you notice , he &apos;s actually needlepointing his own face .
It &apos;s just about being you and being cool with that .
You meet people that you like talking to .
You go places you &apos;ve dreamt about .
So those are the three A &apos;s .
And I just wanted to say thank you to you guys .
I didn &apos;t know what was meat , what was vegetarian .
I was eating olives with pie .
They &apos;ve got an apple here from South Africa .
Can you believe they &apos;ve got a date from Morocco ? &quot;
Is this A &amp; amp ; P ? &quot;
There are so many things to be happy about .
We &apos;re the only ones with jewelry and democracy .
We &apos;ve got fashion magazines , house party scenes .
You can watch a horror movie with monsters .
You can go to a concert and hear guitars jamming .
You can sleep in clean sheets .
You can go to the movies and get good seats .
And that &apos;s the sad part .
You will never be as young as you are right now .
Thank you .
Natalie MacMaster : Cape Breton fiddling in reel time
Matt Cutts : Try something new for 30 days
The idea is actually pretty simple .
Have you ever wanted to write a novel ?
So I did .
You might be sleep-deprived , but you &apos;ll finish your novel .
Now is my book the next great American novel ?
No . I wrote it in a month .
It &apos;s awful .
So here &apos;s one last thing I &apos;d like to mention .
There &apos;s nothing wrong with big , crazy challenges .
In fact , they &apos;re a ton of fun .
But they &apos;re less likely to stick .
Thanks .
Emily Pilloton : Teaching design for change
So this is Bertie County , North Carolina , USA .
It &apos;s about two hours east driving-time from Raleigh .
And it &apos;s very flat . It &apos;s very swampy .
It &apos;s mostly farmland .
We know the symptoms .
It &apos;s the hollowing out of small towns .
It &apos;s downtowns becoming ghost towns .
And Bertie County is no exception to this .
It is the poorest county in the state .
The economy is mostly agricultural .
The biggest employer is the Purdue chicken processing plant .
The county seat is Windsor .
There isn &apos;t even a Walmart .
So the public school students are about 86 percent African-American .
So fast-forward to today , and we now live there .
But this is our front porch . We live there .
We now call this place home .
We have an amazing advocate in Dr. Zullinger .
There &apos;s a nobility of real , hands-on , dirt-under-your-fingernails work .
There is a total vacuum of creative capital in Bertie County .
There isn &apos;t a single licensed architect in the whole county .
So the first of the three is design for education .
The first was a series of renovations of computer labs .
So this is Mr. Perry . He &apos;s the assistant superintendent .
So the second approach is redesigning education itself .
This is the most complex .
There are thousands of these blue dots all over the county .
It &apos;s a vocational training path .
It &apos;s working-class ; it &apos;s blue-collar .
And this is what it looks like .
So I want you to meet three of our students .
This is Ryan .
She is 15 years old .
She loves agriculture and wants to be a high school teacher .
This is Eric . He plays for the football team .
And then this is Anthony .
But we feel like this could work in other places .
Thank you .
David Christian : The history of our world in 18 minutes
First , a video .
Yes , it is a scrambled egg .
And that &apos;s why that video feels a bit strange .
And yet , look around us .
What we see around us is staggering complexity .
And slightly more complex things appear .
And in this way , complexity builds stage by stage .
We refer in big history to these moments as threshold moments .
And at each threshold , the going gets tougher .
And that &apos;s the story that we tell in big history .
You have to survey the whole history of the universe .
So let &apos;s do it .
Around us , there &apos;s nothing .
There &apos;s not even time or space .
And we &apos;ve crossed our first threshold .
The universe is tiny ; it &apos;s smaller than an atom .
It &apos;s incredibly hot .
And it &apos;s expanding at incredible speed .
And all of that happens in the first second .
Now we move forward 380,000 years .
And now simple atoms appear of hydrogen and helium .
We know above all that it was extremely simple .
They &apos;re really a sort of cosmic mush .
But that &apos;s not completely true .
And this is how it works .
Gravity is more powerful where there &apos;s more stuff .
We have our first stars .
And the universe is now significantly more interesting and more complex .
Stars will create the Goldilocks conditions for crossing two new thresholds .
So now the universe is chemically more complex .
So we &apos;ve crossed a fourth threshold of complexity .
Now , the going gets tougher .
I &apos;m talking , of course , about living organisms .
Living organisms are created by chemistry .
We are huge packages of chemicals .
So , chemistry is dominated by the electromagnetic force .
Now , what are the ideal conditions for chemistry ?
What are the Goldilocks conditions ?
But not too little .
Why ?
Now , where do you find such Goldilocks conditions ?
But of course , life is more than just exotic chemistry .
You &apos;ll be familiar with the double helix of DNA .
Each rung contains information .
So , DNA contains information about how to make living organisms .
And DNA also copies itself .
So the information spreads .
Notice that information has become part of our story .
The real beauty of DNA though is in its imperfections .
And occasionally , there are disasters .
Humans appeared about 200,000 years ago .
Let me explain why .
But it is so slow .
They accumulate information , they learn .
Now what makes humans different is human language .
I call this ability collective learning .
It &apos;s what makes us different .
Farming was an energy bonanza .
And exploiting that energy , human populations multiplied .
Human societies got larger , denser , more interconnected .
And that brain is learning at warp speed .
And in the last 200 years , something else has happened .
We &apos;ve stumbled on another energy bonanza in fossil fuels .
So , here we are , back at the convention center .
I hope you agree that this is a powerful story .
But it also contains warnings .
If we avoid that trap , others are waiting for us .
And now , finally , this is what I want .
I thank you for your attention .
Stefan Sagmeister : Designing with slogans
They were combined in the media .
We &apos;re doing changing media .
You can &apos;t help but actually ripping that spider web apart .
All of these things are pieces of graphic design .
We do them for our clients .
They are commissioned .
&quot; Worrying solves nothing . &quot;
The printer lost the file , didn &apos;t tell us .
It said , &quot; Money does does make me happy . &quot;
So this is the big pedestrian zone in Linz .
Everybody participated -- Milton Glaser , Massimo Vignelli .
Singapore was quite in discussion .
And the very last one is a billboard .
This is newsprint plus stencils that lie on the newsprint .
We let that lie around in the sun .
As you all know , newsprint yellows significantly in the sun .
Thank you so much .
Janine di Giovanni : What I saw in the war
This is how war starts .
Your life as you know it goes into suspended animation .
It stops .
Great person .
She thinks she &apos;s dreaming , but she &apos;s not .
and passing her son to someone through a window .
And she didn &apos;t see him for years .
I learned about compassion .
I learned about ordinary people who could be heroes .
I learned about sharing . I learned about camaraderie .
Most of all , I learned about love .
I learned so much about myself .
I believe a story there has to be told .
They don &apos;t get their money out .
They stay because you want to stay in your home .
And then war and chaos descend .
Rwanda is a place that haunts me a lot .
And that was just a small percentage of the dead .
And that &apos;s pretty much why I do it .
Why aren &apos;t you home with Luca ? &quot;
I have to report it . &quot;
But there will always be another war . &quot;
And there , sadly , will always be wars .
He tried to negotiate Syria and couldn &apos;t do it .
I &apos;m not a U.N. conflict resolution person .
All I am is a witness .
And that &apos;s what I try to do .
Who cares about Syria ? Who cares about Bosnia ?
Thank you very much .
Arthur Benjamin : A performance of &quot; Mathemagic &quot;
Well , good morning ladies and gentlemen .

Eight-digit capacity -- don &apos;t you hate that ?
Does yours go higher ?
Oh -- yours does ?
I can probably do it .
I &apos;ll talk to you later .
Would you each enter that on your calculator ?
How many digits do you have , six or seven ?
Seven , and yours ? Seven .
Seven ? Seven ?
And , uncertain .
Yeah .
One , OK , 197042 .
Did you leave out the number 6 ?
Yes , Good , OK , that &apos;s one .

Good , how about the person behind her ?
Call -- call -- what year was it ?
Audience : 1947 . 1947 , and the month ?
Audience : May . May what ?
Audience : Seventh . Seventh -- would that be a Wednesday ?
Audience : Yes .
Thank you very much .
We can do it that way .
I brought with me a book of calendars .
What year was it , first of all ?
Audience : 1966 .
Audience : April . April what ?
Can you confirm , Chris ?
What year , Chris , would you like ?
1824 .
1824 , OK .
And what month ? June .

Sixth -- was that a Sunday ?
It was . And it was cloudy .
Good , thank you very much .
There was a gentleman up here who had a 10-digit calculator .
Where is he , would you stand up , 10-digit guy ?
Audience : Five . Five .
Audience : Seven . Seven .
Audience : Six . Six .
Audience : Eight . Eight .
Audience : Three . Three .
57,683 squared . Yuck .
I &apos;m going to break the problem down into three parts .
Now , let me recap .
Thank you .
Let me explain what that is .
So , without any more stalling , here we go .
38,931 ; double that to get 77,862 .
77,862 becomes cookie fission , cookie fission is 77,822 .
Audience : Yeah !
Good .
Thank you very much .
I hope you enjoyed mathemagics . Thank you .
Erik Brynjolfsson : The key to growth ? Race with the machines
Growth is not dead .
That &apos;s long enough for a generation of managers to retire .
Is there a general purpose technology of our era ?
Sure . It &apos;s the computer .
But technology alone is not enough .
Technology is not destiny .
Let &apos;s look at some data .
So here &apos;s GDP per person in America .
And here &apos;s productivity .
After a lag , productivity accelerated again .
And that &apos;s just the United States .
The global news is even better .
Now getting stuff for free is a good thing , right ?
Sure , of course it is .
But that &apos;s not how economists measure GDP .
Zero price means zero weight in the GDP statistics .
You know , I bet you are too .
Now let &apos;s look to the future .
Welcome to the economics of abundance .
Measurement is the lifeblood of science and progress .
Secondly , the new machine age is exponential .
Computers get better faster than anything else ever .
But our brains are wired for a linear world .
As a result , exponential trends take us by surprise .
Thirdly , the new machine age is combinatorial .
You know , robots are even revolutionizing cat transportation .
Consider one project : IBM &apos;s Watson .
Recently , its teachers let it surf the Internet unsupervised .
The next day , it started answering questions with profanities .
Damn .
But you know , Watson is growing up fast .
So does that mean we have nothing to worry about ?
No . Technology is not destiny .
She can &apos;t .
But 17 percent of tax preparers no longer have jobs .
What can we do to create shared prosperity ?
The answer is not to try to slow down technology .
That is our grand challenge .
But today a computer is no longer the world chess champion .
Racing with the machine beats racing against the machine .
Technology is not destiny .
We shape our destiny .
Thank you .
Jonas Eliasson : How to solve traffic jams
Road congestion is a pervasive phenomenon .
I mean , think about how different cities are , actually .
It &apos;s moving by itself , okay .
But all of these attempts have one thing in common .
&quot; Oh , but surely someone must be in charge .
&quot; No . No . No one is in charge .
It basically organizes itself . &quot;
It organizes itself .
This is a map of Stockholm , my hometown .
You would be wrong .
Because you still have 80 percent of the traffic .
But fortunately , it also works the other way around .
The first day with the congestion charges looked like this .
You really reduce congestion quite substantially .
But it was fun anyway .
So , we followed up . What happened ?
The first day they all came back .
Seventy percent of the population didn &apos;t want this .
Okay . So why can that be ? Why is that ?
Well , think about it this way . Who changed ?
And it turned out that they don &apos;t know themselves .
They &apos;re not even aware of this themselves .
And the other question , who changed their mind ?
Who changed their opinion , and why ?
You should just nudge them in the right direction .
Thank you .
Sheena Iyengar : The art of choosing
But I really like my tea sweet . &quot;
&quot; One does not put sugar in green tea . &quot;
Resting on the saucer were two packets of sugar .
It is essential for success .
In America , the primary locus of choice is the individual .
It &apos;s called &quot; being true to yourself . &quot;
Yet that is exactly what the American paradigm demands .
You will surely find the perfect match .
Let &apos;s test this assumption by heading over to Eastern Europe .
&quot; Oh , but it doesn &apos;t matter .
There are some dilemmas you see .
I am used to no choice . &quot;
We do not need everything that is there . &quot;
Choice no longer offers opportunities , but imposes constraints .
To examine this , let &apos;s go back to the U.S.
and then hop across the pond to France .
What do they do ?
What do any parent do ?
They had all suffered the same tragedy .
But there was a big difference .
We found that it did .
He gave us a new perspective on life . &quot;
How did they get me to do that ? &quot;
In a number of cases they were even clinically depressed .
This narrative promises so much : freedom , happiness , success .
No single narrative serves the needs of everyone everywhere .
And this does not lead to a paralyzing moral relativism .
Rather , it teaches us when and how to act .
Thank you .
Thank you .
And I can &apos;t decide .
And one was called &quot; Ballet Slippers . &quot;
And the other one was called &quot; Adorable . &quot;
&quot; Okay , great . &quot;
The other lady tells me to wear &quot; Adorable . &quot;
&quot; What does it look like ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s a glamorous shade of pink . &quot;
What &apos;s different about them ? &quot;
Okay , we got that .
Thank you . Sheena Iyengar . Thank you Sheena .
Abigail Washburn : Building US-China relations ... by banjo
And I was like , &quot; Sure . &quot;
In fact , I went to Nashville .
And after a few months I was writing songs .
&#91; Chinese &#93; Outside your door the world is waiting .
Inside your heart a voice is calling .
Go get it , girl .
And I &apos;ve played thousands of shows .
And I see the power of music .
I see the power of music to connect cultures .
It &apos;s just incredible .
And this little girl comes up to me .
And I sat down , she sat on my lap .
She started singing her song .
And I know U.S.-China relations doesn &apos;t need another lawyer .
Thank you .
Kevin Kelly : How technology evolves
Should I be pro-technology ? Should I embrace it full arms ?
And I &apos;m not even sure we know what technology is .
And one definition of technology is that which is first recorded .
But I was interested in another definition of technology .
Something , again , that went back to something more fundamental .
So this is a very rough attempt to think out loud .
We have really no idea .
Those fungi and bacteria are as highly evolved as humans .
And we see a drift towards complexity that &apos;s very intuitive .
And the last thing , I bring back this nudibranch .
And again , my question is , what does technology want ?
There &apos;s obviously diversity . Huge numbers of things .
This is all the contents of a Japanese home .
And it came up with 6,000 different species of products .
And the technology is only being thrown out by other technologies .
But as a sideline , he happens to collect cornets .
This is his chart , which is not quite published yet .
And the answer is : all of them .
I don &apos;t know who needs a corn sheller .
So we &apos;ve all heard about the Amish giving up cars .
We &apos;ve heard about the Japanese giving up guns .
They &apos;re actually changing the way in which ideas are generated .
It &apos;s accelerating the way in which we search for ideas .
And what technology is really about is better ways to evolve .
That is what we call an &quot; infinite game . &quot;
And I believe that technology is actually a cosmic force .
That &apos;s the definition . There was no temperature .
Those are all basically the same thing .
And those are the things that technology brings us .
Differences , freedom , choices , possibilities .
Imagine Hitchcock before the technologies of film .
We want a trillion zillion species of one individuals .
That &apos;s what technology really wants .
Our humanity is actually defined by technology .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about .
You see , technology is a way to evolve the evolution .
That &apos;s what technology wants .
That recursive nature is the infinite game .
Thank you .
Paolo Cardini : Forget multitasking , try monotasking
I &apos;m a designer and an educator .
But how efficient is , really , this multitasking ?
Let &apos;s consider for a while the option of monotasking .
A couple of examples .
Look at that .
This is my multitasking activity result .
But what about ourselves , and what about our reality ?
Another example : Have you ever been to Venice ?
So nowadays , everyone could produce his mono product .
Thank you .
Diana Laufenberg : How to learn ? From mistakes
The information was inside my house and it was awesome .
But the information was closer to me .
I could get access to it .
They produced flyers . They called offices .
They checked schedules . They were meeting with secretaries .
&quot; She doesn &apos;t know what she &apos;s in for . &quot;
I had to just sit and watch .
It was theirs . It was experiential . It was authentic .
It meant something to them .
And they will step up .
Luckily , I didn &apos;t have to teach them American government .
Could teach them the more exciting topic of geography .
Again , &quot; thrilled &quot; to learn .
There was no expense cost . Perfect field trip .
I asked them to produce a little movie about it .
It &apos;s the first time we &apos;d done this .
Fast-forward to Pennsylvania , where I find myself today .
And they had certain criteria to do it .
But I gave them the room to just do the thing .
Go create . Go figure it out .
Let &apos;s see what we can do .
This was done in like two or three days .
And they immediately went , &quot; There it is . &quot;
Didn &apos;t read anything . &quot; There it is . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Well what makes it great ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Go read it . &quot;
Ask them really interesting questions .
They will not disappoint .
Technology &apos;s long tail
You &apos;ve probably seen something like this before .
The first is the critical price .
And then finally , a lot of technologies commoditize .
Towards the end of their life , they become nearly free .
The next phase it hit was displacement .
You can see around 2001 it finally out-sold the VCR .
And then finally , DVDs are approaching free .
Start with gene sequencing .
That &apos;s as opposed to billions just a few years ago .
Each one of these genes has potential diagnostic test .
Here &apos;s another technology that &apos;s approaching a critical price .
Today it &apos;s less than 50 cents a day .
Linux is another good example .
Now we &apos;ve switched to critical mass .
These are now technologies that are hitting critical mass .
It &apos;s not just for the geeks any more .
Voice Over IP is something you may have heard something about .
There &apos;s a company created by the Kazaa founders called Skype .
And the same thing &apos;s happening on the carrier side .
It &apos;s going to look a little bit like that .
And finally , free . Free is really , really interesting .
It &apos;s an economic force ; it &apos;s a technical force .
It &apos;s a deflationary force , if not handled right .
It is abundance , as opposed to scarcity .
Free is probably the most interesting thing .
And you &apos;ve seen the numbers .
They &apos;re facing a force that they haven &apos;t faced before .
It &apos;s seven cents a minute , in many cases .
Thank you .
George Papandreou : Imagine a European democracy without borders
And I won &apos;t provide some feel-good , ready-made solutions .
Failure of leadership .
What is the failure of leadership today ?
And why is our democracy not working ?
Let &apos;s start from the beginning .
Let &apos;s start from democracy .
I &apos;m the younger one there , to the side .
Then one night , military trucks drive up to our house .
Soldiers storm the door .
They find me up on the top terrace .
Well , we survived , but democracy did not .
Seven brutal years of dictatorship which we spent in exile .
Let me tell you a story .
Sunday evening , Brussels , April 2010 .
I &apos;m sitting with my counterparts in the European Union .
But despite our electoral mandate , the markets mistrusted us .
But time we didn &apos;t get .
Picture yourselves around the table in Brussels .
I said , &quot; Why ? These are important decisions .
Let &apos;s deliberate a little bit longer . &quot;
We quickly came to a decision in those 10 minutes .
Instead , I had a very humbling experience .
But worse , we were trapped by our collective ignorance .
We were led by our fears .
There will be havoc in the markets again . &quot;
Since leaving office , I have had time to reflect .
So let &apos;s try something else .
Let &apos;s throw democracy at the problem .
And those who shunned politics , well , they were idiots .
They serve the demos , democracy .
How do we democratize globalization ?
Well , this is exactly where I think Europe fits in .
It is in their interest that all of us are idiots .
Let &apos;s not be .
Thank you .
Help us understand how you felt after the decision .
How do you reconcile that ?
George , thank you for coming to TED .
GP : Thank you very much . Thank you .
JR : One year of turning the world inside out
So there has been a lot of change .
You are going to take the photos .
You &apos;re going to send them to me .
This is Inside Out .
One hundred thousand posters have been printed this year .
Those are the kind of posters , let me show you .
And we keep sending more every day .
This is the size .
This one was from Haiti .
Boom ! This is what happened .
They really make Inside Out their own project .
Russia . Chad wanted to fight against homophobia in Russia .
They used Inside Out as a platform for protest .
Karachi , Pakistan .
Sharmeen is actually here .
And I want to thank her today .
The seventh generation are still fighting for their rights .
He pasted up portraits all over his reservation .
And he &apos;s here also today .
Do you know what it takes to do this ?
People , energy , make the glue , organize the team .
It was amazing .
There are tons of school projects .
Twenty percent of the posters we are receiving comes from schools .
Education is so essential .
Here they even got the help of the firemen .
There should be even more schools doing this kind of project .
Of course we wanted to go back to Israel and Palestine .
This is march , the 450,000 march -- beginning of September .
They were all holding their photo as a statement .
It &apos;s everywhere .
Maybe not in one year . That &apos;s the beginning .
But maybe we should change the question .
Can art change people &apos;s lives ?
From what I &apos;ve seen this year , yes .
And you know what ? It &apos;s just the beginning .
Let &apos;s turn the world inside out together .
Thank you .
Scilla Elworthy : Fighting with nonviolence
Fight back ? Give in ?
Use more force ?
has been with me ever since I was a child .
And I rushed upstairs and started packing my suitcase .
And I said , &quot; I &apos;m going to Budapest . &quot;
And she said , &quot; What on Earth for ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Kids are getting killed there .
There &apos;s something terrible happening . &quot;
And she said , &quot; Don &apos;t be so silly . &quot;
And I started to cry .
You &apos;re much too young to help .
You need training . I &apos;ll help you .
But just unpack your suitcase . &quot;
I wanted to understand how violence , how oppression , works .
And they did it in a total devotion to non-violence .
They realized that using force against force doesn &apos;t work .
So what does work ?
And what I need to develop is self-knowledge to do that .
When do I give in ?
What will I stand up for ?
But she told the students to sit down .
And no one got killed .
But we have to practice .
So what about our fear ?
I have a little mantra .
My fear grows fat on the energy I feed it .
And if it grows very big it probably happens .
You &apos;re the adult .
The fear is the child .
How can this be made better ?
How can the child feel stronger ?
And you make a plan .
So I did the thing .
So that &apos;s fear . What about anger ?
Wherever there is injustice there &apos;s anger .
And I learned this in my work with nuclear weapon policy-makers .
Totally ineffective .
They are human beings just like us .
And they &apos;re doing what they think is best .
So that &apos;s the third one , anger .
It was still governments telling people what to do .
This century there &apos;s a shift .
It &apos;s bottom-up or grassroots power .
It &apos;s like mushrooms coming through concrete .
They know best what to do .
So Peace Direct gets behind them to do that .
So the training of the troops has to change .
The British military have always been much better at this .
And complete silence fell .
Now that to me is wisdom in action .
In the moment , that &apos;s what he did .
And it &apos;s happening everywhere now .
You don &apos;t believe me ?
And this hasn &apos;t just happened .
And it &apos;s been translated into 26 languages .
It &apos;s flown around the world .
Because finally human beings are getting it .
Now I don &apos;t just believe in non-violence .
I don &apos;t have to believe in it .
I see evidence everywhere of how it works .
Thank you .
Gever Tulley : 5 dangerous things you should let your kids do
I don &apos;t have children .
I &apos;m Gever Tulley .
So we build a lot of things .
And I do put power tools into the hands of second-graders .
So where does this trend stop ?
The book is called &quot; 50 Dangerous Things . &quot;
This is five dangerous things .
Thing number one -- play with fire .
So , playing with fire .
And you can think of the open-pit fire as a laboratory .
Number two -- own a pocketknife .
These are Inuit children cutting whale blubber .
And yeah , they &apos;re going to cut themselves .
But you know , they &apos;re young . They heal fast .
Number three -- throw a spear .
So those are great .
Number four -- deconstruct appliances .
There is a world of interesting things inside your dishwasher .
It &apos;s a sense of knowability , that something is knowable .
Number five -- two-parter .
Break the Digital Millennium Copyright Act .
You &apos;ve just broken a law .
Technically the RIAA can come and persecute you .
This is -- this is a great stage for a kid .
So -- and it &apos;s perfectly legal .
It &apos;s very safe actually .
And it &apos;s fun for the whole family .
So , let &apos;s see .
Mike Matas : A next-generation digital book
The book starts like this . This is the cover .
Or , we can scroll through the pages at the bottom .
Zoom into it and see where it was taken .
So you can open this one .
AG : Most modern wind turbines consist of a large ...
MM : It starts playing immediately .
This one shows the wind potential all around the United States .
We can do the same for geothermal energy and solar power .
This is one of my favorites .
So this shows ...
It also runs on the iPhone .
And it works the exact same way .
You can pinch into any page .
Open it up .
Thank you .
That &apos;s spectacular .
Do you want to be a publisher , a technology licenser ?
What is the business here ?
Is this something that other people can do ?
All right . Mike , thanks so much .
MM : Thank you .
This is the patent .
Yet , it &apos;s 160 years old .
So we turn to the field of vaccines .
That &apos;s a pretty hard act to beat .
I share that view .
And that &apos;s problematic in terms of the rollout of vaccines .
These are early deaths that take place .
Now , this is a specimen of the Nanopatch .
It &apos;s a spring-operated device .
Then we can take the Nanopatch off and discard it .
And indeed we can make a reuse of the applicator itself .
So it does that well .
And we see this kind of data .
It &apos;s off the grid entirely .
So what if you &apos;ve targeted cells ?
In the world of vaccines , what does that mean ?
The world of vaccines is getting better .
It &apos;s getting more systematic .
It &apos;s a gambler &apos;s game even today .
So , we had to do that gamble .
That &apos;s a real fresh opportunity .
And certainly in the world of vaccines that can be important .
Now , the stakes are very high .
That &apos;s an important improvement .
We &apos;re delighted about it as well .
We &apos;ve started with Papua New Guinea .
That &apos;s a challenge .
Now , doing this kind of work is not easy .
Thank you .
Julie Burstein : 4 lessons in creativity
This one is more than 400 years old .
I would come home with my clothes reeking of woodsmoke .
Raku is a wonderful metaphor for the process of creativity .
It was supposed to break , but that &apos;s okay .
Julie Burstein : Isn &apos;t that a wonderful story ?
You can see the sort of break in the everyday .
He makes us the subject of his art .
There &apos;s a fourth embrace , and it &apos;s the hardest .
That &apos;s a tough space to stand in .
You know where this story goes .
and she said , &quot; Probably never . &quot;
And I thought , &quot; I &apos;m gonna make that record .
My office was just a few blocks away .
Time is unstoppable , and it transforms the event .
Thank you .
Justin Hall-Tipping : Freeing energy from the grid
Why can &apos;t we solve these problems ?
We know what they are .
Something always seems to stop us .
Why ?
I remember March the 15th , 2000 .
The B15 iceberg broke off the Ross Ice Shelf .
I &apos;m sorry , there &apos;s nothing normal about this .
Two nanometers is 20 atoms in thickness .
Think of the space that we spend most of our time .
In winter , exactly the opposite is happening .
It &apos;s a thousand times more conductive than copper .
How is that possible ?
You think of carbon as black .
Carbon at the nanoscale is actually transparent and flexible .
We &apos;d have to see at night , right ?
This lets you do it .
Firstly I &apos;m going to show you the transparency .
Transparency is key .
It &apos;s a film that you can look through .
And then I &apos;m going to turn the lights out .
What if we combined it with this ?
The power plant of tomorrow is no power plant .
We talked about generating and using .
We said , &quot; Could you build this ? &quot;
And what they built was eBox .
It &apos;s my energy .
These also require tremendous amounts of energy .
We &apos;re simply not going to do that .
It &apos;s been a long time in coming for me .
18 years ago , I saw a photograph in the paper .
I &apos;ve carried this photograph with me every day since then .
It &apos;s a picture of a little girl dying of thirst .
By any standard this is wrong .
It &apos;s just wrong .
We can do better than this .
We should do better than this .
It &apos;ll never happen . You don &apos;t have enough money .
You don &apos;t have enough time .
Thank you .
Damon Horowitz : We need a &quot; moral operating system &quot;
Power .
That is the word that comes to mind .
We &apos;re the new technologists .
How much power do we have ?
That &apos;s the kind of power I feel in this room .
Let &apos;s take an example .
What can we do with just one person &apos;s data ?
What can we do with that guy &apos;s data ?
I can look at your financial records .
I can tell if you pay your bills on time .
I know if you &apos;re good to give a loan to .
I can look at your clicking patterns .
I &apos;m here to talk about what we should do .
What &apos;s the right thing to do ?
Fair enough .
But it brings me back .
So what should we be doing with that guy &apos;s data ?
So we can make money ?
Which one is it ?
How should we figure it out ?
I know : crowdsource . Let &apos;s crowdsource this .
Let &apos;s do a show of hands -- iPhone .
Uh huh .
Android .
Next question , a little bit harder .
Or should we leave him alone ?
Collect his data .
Leave him alone .
You &apos;re safe . It &apos;s fine .
Kant .
Mill .
Not as many votes .
Yeah , that &apos;s a terrifying result .
What &apos;s a moral operating system ?
We all know right and wrong , right ?
But how do we figure out what &apos;s right and wrong ?
Maybe we just follow our gut .
Maybe we take a vote -- we crowdsource .
So let &apos;s get a moral framework .
We &apos;re numbers people , living by numbers .
I know a guy who did exactly that .
A brilliant guy -- he &apos;s been dead 2,500 years .
Plato , that &apos;s right .
Remember him -- old philosopher ?
You were sleeping during that class .
He was worried about right and wrong .
He wanted to know what is just .
I don &apos;t want opinions ; I want knowledge .
In math , we know the objective facts .
Take a number , any number -- two .
Favorite number . I love that number .
There are truths about two .
That &apos;s true no matter what thing you &apos;re talking about .
They all participate in the truths that two has .
They all have two-ness in them .
And therefore , it &apos;s not a matter of opinion .
What if , Plato thought , ethics was like math ?
What if there were a pure form of justice ?
That &apos;s a stunning vision .
That &apos;s as ambitious as we are .
He wants to solve ethics .
He wants objective truths .
Aristotle , in particular , he was not amused .
He thought it was impractical .
Aristotle thought ethics wasn &apos;t a lot like math .
If you think that , Plato &apos;s not your guy .
But don &apos;t give up .
That sound familiar ?
That &apos;s a utilitarian moral framework .
But here &apos;s the way it works .
It does something intrinsic to the act .
It &apos;s not like its relation to some abstract form .
It &apos;s just a matter of the consequences .
That would be simple . Then we know what to do .
Let &apos;s take an example .
I thought , that guy looks suspicious .
That has a very high utility to prevent that damage .
If you feel that way , that &apos;s a utilitarian choice .
But maybe you don &apos;t feel that way either .
Maybe you think , it &apos;s his phone .
He has autonomy .
It doesn &apos;t matter what the calculations are .
It &apos;s not a matter of calculation .
So let &apos;s stop .
So let &apos;s cut to the chase .
How should we be making our decisions ?
What should we be doing ? What &apos;s the answer ?
What &apos;s the formula ?
There &apos;s not a formula .
There &apos;s not a simple answer .
Ethics is hard .
Ethics requires thinking .
And that &apos;s uncomfortable .
But they can &apos;t .
We &apos;re the ones who have to do it .
Not only can we think , we must .
It arises from not thinking . &quot;
That &apos;s what she called the &quot; banality of evil . &quot;
So let &apos;s do that . Let &apos;s think .
In fact , let &apos;s start right now .
What did I do ? Did I follow my gut ?
Or now we have a few more choices .
Are you ready ? Go .
Stop . Good work .
Now the next step -- try this .
Not right now . Wait till I finish talking .
Do it over lunch .
In fact , find somebody from the humanities .
It was technologists and humanists at that big BiblioTech Conference .
It &apos;s based on Norse legend .
It &apos;s Gods and mythical creatures fighting over magical jewelry . &quot;
That &apos;s interesting .
And we care about right and wrong .
We care what happens in that opera .
We care what happens in &quot; Apocalypse Now . &quot;
And we certainly care what happens with our technologies .
We &apos;re the ones writing this opera .
This is our movie .
We figure out what will happen with this technology .
We determine how this will all end .
Thank you .
Herbie Hancock : An all-star set
Herbie Hancock : Thank you .
Marcus Miller .
Harvey Mason .
Thank you . Thank you very much .
Mary Roach : 10 things you didn &apos;t know about orgasm
The title is &quot; Observations of In-Utero Masturbation . &quot;
Orgasm is a reflex of the autonomic nervous system .
Genital stimulation . Duh .
And she went to a neurologist who was fascinated .
No . It was the whole , you know , motion .
It &apos;s so sad .
She was part of a study at Rutgers University .
You gotta love that . Rutgers .
So I interviewed her in Oakland , in a sushi restaurant .
It was remarkable . It took about one minute .
There is a reflex called the Lazarus reflex .
It &apos;s like this . You trigger the spot .
The dead guy , or gal , goes ... like that .
Very unsettling for people working in pathology labs .
Obviously it wouldn &apos;t be as much fun for the person .
But it would be an orgasm -- nonetheless .
I said to her , &quot; You should do an experiment .
I said , &quot; You should actually do this . &quot;
Theodoor van de Velde was something of a semen connoisseur .
Very heavy hetero guy .
He tried everything his friends suggested .
Nothing seemed to help .
And lo and behold , the hiccups went away .
Married , single , unattached hiccupper .
It was called the &quot; upsuck &quot; theory .
They didn &apos;t buy it .
This is the 1950s .
Anyway these women sat in front of an X-ray device .
And they masturbated .
Did not find any evidence of upsuck .
I have an answer for you . I have two answers .
You can use flour and water , or cornstarch and water .
I actually found three separate recipes in the literature .
This one said , &quot; Yield : one ejaculate . &quot;
There &apos;s another way that orgasm might boost fertility .
This one involves men .
Which I thought was an interesting idea , theory .
So now you have an evolutionary excuse .
Okay .
And I got a copy of this DVD .
So uh , okay .
It all looks very innocent .
This is to mimic the weight of the boar .
And the happy result .
I love this video .
Why don &apos;t you have the farmers do that ?
That &apos;s not one of your five steps . &quot;
This is the ejaculation face of the stump-tailed macaque .
This did not stop Masters and Johnson .
They developed an artificial coition machine .
This is basically a penis camera on a motor .
And the woman would have sex with it .
That is what they would do . Pretty amazing .
Sadly , this device has been dismantled .
This was not idle curiosity .
Kinsey thought it was bunk , so he got to work .
It wasn &apos;t spurted or thrown or ejected under great force .
Yes . Exactly .
Sadly , he &apos;s anonymous . His name is not mentioned .
Thank you very much .
Thanks !
Rachel Sussman : The world &apos;s oldest living things
This strange-looking plant is called the Llareta .
It also happens to be a relative of parsley .
The project is part art and part science .
There &apos;s an environmental component .
The tree was in part a catalyst for the project .
So it was the slow churn , if you will .
And this is heightened by a couple of particular experiences .
It was like visiting a more innocent time on the planet .
And then , of course , there &apos;s the lichens .
These lichens grow only one centimeter every hundred years .
I think that really puts human lifespans into a different perspective .
And then from underground to underwater .
What looks like a forest is actually only one tree .
It also happens to be male and , in theory immortal .
This is a clonal tree as well .
And aside from coral , the answer is no .
And back to the yew here .
And now down to another part of the world .
And the Baobabs in particular are a great example of this .
And what &apos;s more , it &apos;s actually a tree .
It &apos;s a primitive conifer .
You &apos;ll notice that it &apos;s bearing cones down the center .
This is something called an underground forest .
The tree can easily recover .
And you see it has that similar circular form .
And there &apos;s some younger clones dotting the landscape behind it .
You &apos;ll see also , there &apos;s a flag on Antarctica .
Thank you .
Daniel Suarez : The kill decision shouldn &apos;t belong to a robot
But I &apos;m actually not here to talk about fiction .
There &apos;s actually a technical term for this : lethal autonomy .
And actually , they &apos;re very quickly becoming a reality .
And this has always been the case , throughout history .
For example , these were state-of-the-art weapons systems in 1400 A.D.
Power was focused at the very top .
And what changed ? Technological innovation .
Gunpowder , cannon .
Representative government began to form .
But time is a factor .
Now we live in a global economy .
High-tech manufacturing is occurring on most continents .
This raises the very real possibility of anonymous war .
But I think the truth is the exact opposite .
Data powers high-tech societies .
Lines indicate social connectedness between individuals .
Notice that certain individuals are highlighted .
These are the hubs of social networks .
And it could set the stage for global action .
Because we need an international legal framework for robotic weapons .
I think the secret will be transparency .
We have license plates on cars , tail numbers on aircraft .
This is no different .
We must ban the deployment and development of killer robots .
Let &apos;s not succumb to the temptation to automate war .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Rory Stewart : Why democracy matters
And this isn &apos;t just a problem in Britain .
Since then , what &apos;s happened ?
What is wrong with the people that we have chosen ?
Why should we get away from those arguments ?
The point about democracy is not instrumental .
It &apos;s not about the things that it brings .
The point about democracy is intrinsic .
Democracy is not simply a question of structures .
It is a state of mind . It is an activity .
And part of that activity is honesty .
That can mean different things in different countries .
It &apos;s a question of what the citizens do .
Thank you very much indeed .
Christien Meindertsma : How pig parts make the world turn
Please raise your hand -- oh , that &apos;s a lot .
In the last year ?
A lot goes to the U.K. , Germany .
And I spent about three years researching .
In total , they weigh 103.7 kilograms .
You probably start the day with a shower .
Fine bone china -- this is a real classic .
In interior decorating , the pig &apos;s actually quite there .
And what it is -- it &apos;s actually steak .
And this also actually happens with tuna and scallops .
So , with the steak , you might drink a beer .
This actually also goes for wine as well as fruit juice .
So , this is actually a healthier cigarette .
Well , this must be the strangest thing I found .
And can you send me a bullet ? &quot;
Are you in anyway related to the Dutch government ? &quot;
It &apos;s really a sort of magical moment .
And the makers of this thing were really enthusiastic .
In total , I found 185 products .
Thank you very much .
Malcolm Gladwell : The strange tale of the Norden bombsight
Thank you .
It &apos;s a real pleasure to be here .
I talked about spaghetti sauce .
And so many people , I guess , watch those videos .
The theme of this morning &apos;s session is Things We Make .
And the man &apos;s name is Carl Norden .
Carl Norden was born in 1880 .
And he was Swiss .
And Carl Norden is very firmly in the former camp .
He &apos;s an engineer .
He goes to the Federal Polytech in Zurich .
And he &apos;s a Swiss engineer , Carl .
And I mean that in its fullest sense of the word .
It &apos;s a complicated physics problem .
The bombsights that were available were incredibly crude .
But Carl Norden is really the one who cracks the code .
And he comes up with this incredibly complicated device .
It weighs about 50 lbs .
It &apos;s called the Norden Mark 15 bombsight .
And he makes this complicated thing .
And the bombsight will tell him when to drop the bomb .
It was like manna from heaven .
He was simple the instrument of God &apos;s will .
And what was God &apos;s will ?
And what did the Norden bombsight do ?
Well it allowed you to do that .
And the box is handcuffed to one of the guards .
It &apos;s never allowed to be photographed .
The Norden bombsight is the Holy Grail .
So what happens during the Second World War ?
Well , it turns out it &apos;s not the Holy Grail .
And of course , in wartime , conditions aren &apos;t perfect .
Secondly , it breaks down a lot .
But of course , what happens in real life ?
There are clouds , right .
It needs cloudless sky to be really accurate .
Not a lot .
And the chemical plant comprised 757 acres .
10 percent . 10 percent .
So why do we talk about the Norden bombsight ?
They &apos;ve invented websites that will allow people to be free .
You know what the answer was ?
Zero , not a single one .
Now why is that ?
Is it because their weapons weren &apos;t accurate ?
Oh no , they were brilliantly accurate .
Or take the battle in Afghanistan .
It &apos;s the drone . What is the drone ?
Well it is the grandson of the Norden Mark 15 bombsight .
It is this weapon of devastating accuracy and precision .
Now what is the accuracy of those drones ?
Well it &apos;s extraordinary .
But do you know what the crucial thing is ?
I have not described to you a success story .
I &apos;ve described to you the opposite of a success story .
But of course , it didn &apos;t matter .
He was a committed Christian .
It would have broken his heart .
Sarah-Jayne Blakemore : The mysterious workings of the adolescent brain
It can go on a long time .
Prefrontal cortex is an interesting brain area .
You can think of it a bit like pruning a rosebush .
So I &apos;ll just give you an example from my lab .
So this is a soccer game .
So you don &apos;t have to ask any of these guys .
In this task , you see a set of shelves .
Now your task is to move objects around .
So imagine he tells you to move the top truck left .
They move the white truck instead of the blue truck .
So we sometimes laugh about teenagers .
Is it something we &apos;ve invented recently in the West ? &quot;
It gives you the kick out of taking risks .
It &apos;s a fantastic opportunity for learning and creativity .
Paul Rothemund : Playing with DNA that self-assembles
And so this idea has a lot of traction with us .
So how many of you know what I &apos;m talking about ?
So that &apos;s great . So that was too easy .
You guys have very insecure computers , OK ?
This is a computer program made of zeros and ones .
A computer magician can write this thing .
And a lot of them are actually pretty good .
Monika Bulaj : The hidden light of Afghanistan
I was walking through the forests of my grandmother &apos;s tales .
Behind the destruction , I found a soul of places .
I met humble people .
I heard their prayer and ate their bread .
And I ever met more humble people .
And I shared their bread and their prayer .
This is why I went to Afghanistan .
One day , I crossed the bridge over the Oxus River .
I was alone on foot .
But he gave me a cup of tea .
And I understood that his surprise was my protection .
My only weapon was my notebook and my Leica .
Hidden river , interconnected with the mysticism from Gibraltar to India .
These are the nomad girls who became prostitutes for Afghan businessmen .
Thanks .
Sheryl Sandberg : Why we have too few women leaders
The numbers tell the story quite clearly .
190 heads of state -- nine are women .
A recent study in the U.S.
How do we change these numbers at the top ?
How do we make this different ?
What are the messages we need to tell ourselves ?
What are the messages we tell our daughters ?
I don &apos;t have the right answer .
I don &apos;t even have it for myself .
This is hard . I feel guilty sometimes .
One , sit at the table .
Two , make your partner a real partner .
And three , don &apos;t leave before you leave .
Number one : sit at the table .
And everyone kind of sat at the table .
Don &apos;t you love that kind of thing from college ?
I wish I could do that now .
The three of us take this class together .
My brother is kind of busy .
&quot; You got the top grade in the class ?
You don &apos;t know anything . &quot;
Women do not negotiate for themselves in the workforce .
Obviously . Why are you even asking ? &quot;
Why does this matter ?
I wish the answer were easy .
Own your own success . &quot;
I wish I could tell that to my daughter .
But it &apos;s not that simple .
There &apos;s a really good study that shows this really well .
But that one word made a really big difference .
The bad news was that everyone liked Howard .
You want to spend the day fishing with him .
But Heidi ? Not so sure .
You &apos;re not sure you &apos;d want to work for her .
This is the complication .
And she said , &quot; I learned something today .
I learned that I need to keep my hand up . &quot;
I said , &quot; What do you mean ? &quot;
We &apos;ve got to get women to sit at the table .
Message number two : make your partner a real partner .
The data shows this very clearly .
I think the cause is more complicated .
Message number three : don &apos;t leave before you leave .
She starts leaning back .
She didn &apos;t even have a boyfriend .
It needs to be rewarding .
You need to feel like you &apos;re making a difference .
Don &apos;t leave before you leave .
Stay in .
They &apos;re just not moving .
But I &apos;m hopeful that future generations can .
I think it would be a better world .
I have two children .
I have a five-year-old son and a two-year-old daughter .
Thank you .
Daniel H. Cohen : For argument &apos;s sake
And what that means is that I argue .
But I also like to think a lot about arguing .
Well , there &apos;s some other puzzles .
Is this proposition true ? Is this theory a good theory ?
Is this a viable interpretation of the data or the text ?
Yeah , we have those arguments too .
But those aren &apos;t the important arguments .
So what do we win when we win an argument ?
So why do we even try to argue ?
Think of a mathematician &apos;s argument .
Are the premises warranted ? Are the inferences valid ?
Does the conclusion follow from the premises ?
We want killer arguments .
That &apos;s the kind of argument we want .
It is the dominant way of thinking about arguments .
First it elevates tactics over substance .
You can take a class in logic , argumentation .
It magnifies the us-versus-them aspect of it .
It makes it adversarial . It &apos;s polarizing .
We don &apos;t get anywhere .
And let me explain what I mean .
Suppose you and I have an argument .
You believe a proposition , P , and I don &apos;t .
And you give me your reasons .
And you answer my objection .
Great cognitive gain . Okay . Who won that argument ?
What did you gain cognitively from convincing me ?
This guy &apos;s a good arguer .
And there &apos;s something wrong with that picture .
What we need is new exit strategies for arguments .
We need to think of new kinds of arguments .
That &apos;s the bad news .
The argument-as-war metaphor is just , it &apos;s a monster .
I don &apos;t have an answer .
But I have some suggestions , and here &apos;s my suggestion .
So try this .
Think of all the roles that people play in arguments .
There &apos;s the audience in rhetorical arguments .
There &apos;s the reasoner in arguments as proofs .
Can you do that ? I think you can .
Now , I lose a lot of arguments .
Thank you .
Raghava KK : Shake up your story
Hi everyone .
I &apos;m an artist and a dad -- second time around .
Thank you .
And I want to share with you my latest art project .
It &apos;s a children &apos;s book for the iPad .
It &apos;s a little quirky and silly .
You can tickle the rug .
You can make the baby poop .
You can do all those fun things .
You can burst bubbles .
You can draw , as everyone should .
It &apos;s not the way I was brought up .
You don &apos;t like it ?
Shake it , and you have a lesbian couple .
Shake it , and you have a heterosexual couple .
I have to tell you about my childhood .
Basically , I celebrated every religious function .
We all had to fast during Ramadan .
It was a very beautiful time .
This caused major riots in my city .
I &apos;m like , &quot; Dude , I &apos;m Hindu . &quot;
He &apos;s like , &quot; Huh ! &quot;
Imagine history being taught differently .
I have another idea .
But when you shake it , you get Pakistan &apos;s perspective .
Shake it again , and you get the British perspective .
You have to separate fact from bias , right .
Even my books on children have cute , fuzzy animals .
But they &apos;re playing geopolitics .
They &apos;re playing out Israel-Palestine , India-Pakistan .
You know , I &apos;m making a very important argument .
Thank you very much .
Margaret Heffernan : Dare to disagree
Now , Alice had trouble getting funding for her research .
Now , she had no idea what to look for .
Had the children eaten boiled sweets ?
Had they consumed colored drinks ?
Did they eat fish and chips ?
Did they have indoor or outdoor plumbing ?
What time of life had they started school ?
Now that finding flew in the face of conventional wisdom .
In fact , she need not have hurried .
A child a week was dying , but nothing changed .
Openness alone can &apos;t drive change .
So , how did she know that she was right ?
Well , she had a fantastic model for thinking .
Alice was very warm , very empathetic with her patients .
George frankly preferred numbers to people .
But he said this fantastic thing about their working relationship .
He actively sought disconfirmation .
He saw his job as creating conflict around her theories .
Alice and George were very good at conflict .
They saw it as thinking .
So what does that kind of constructive conflict require ?
That requires a lot of patience and a lot of energy .
So how do organizations think ?
Well , for the most part , they don &apos;t .
Eighty-five percent is a really big number .
They can &apos;t think together .
So how do we develop the skills that we need ?
Because it does take skill and practice , too .
So , he didn &apos;t really want to say anything .
After all , maybe they knew something he didn &apos;t .
Maybe he &apos;d look stupid .
It turned out everybody had exactly the same questions and doubts .
So now Joe had allies . They could think together .
And his colleagues don &apos;t think of him as a crank .
They think of him as a leader .
Open information is fantastic , open networks are essential .
Openness isn &apos;t the end .
It &apos;s the beginning .
Karen Bass : Unseen footage , untamed nature
I &apos;m a very lucky person .
What an amazing experience .
And it made me want to explore more .
Images of grizzly bears are pretty familiar .
You see them all the time , you think .
Lots of snow in which to dig a den .
But getting down can be a challenge for small cubs .
KB : I love that shot .
I always get goosebumps every time I see it .
That was filmed from a helicopter using a gyro-stabilized camera .
But technology alone isn &apos;t enough .
And that sequence was especially difficult .
The first year we got nothing .
And we hung around with a helicopter for two whole weeks .
And eventually we got lucky .
And we managed to get that magic moment .
It depends solely on the bat .
See what you think .
The tube-lipped nectar bat .
But how to reach it ?
Necessity is the mother of evolution .
If human , he &apos;d have a nine-foot tongue .
KB : What a tongue .
So imagine how quick that thing is in real life .
And the truth is I just don &apos;t have one .
There are so many wonderful places .
But some locations draw you back time and time again .
But at 15,000 feet , it &apos;s tough .
And that pounding head just feels like a constant hangover .
Have a look .
Where deserts freeze and waters boil .
Some of the world &apos;s astronomers have telescopes nearby .
Thank you for letting me share that with you .
Dan Buettner : How to live to be 100 +
The other 90 percent is dictated by our lifestyle .
You have the USDA food pyramid .
There is what Oprah tells us .
There is what Doctor Oz tells us .
Should you be running marathons or doing yoga ?
Should you eat organic meats or should you be eating tofu ?
When it comes to supplements , should you be taking them ?
How about these hormones or resveratrol ?
And does purpose play into it ?
Spirituality ? And how about how we socialize ?
False .
Your chances are very low .
The problem is that we &apos;re not programmed for longevity .
We are programmed for something called procreative success .
I love that word .
It reminds me of my college days .
After that the effect of evolution completely dissipates .
False .
There is just too many things to go wrong .
Those cells turn themselves over once every eight years .
And it builds up exponentially .
Well , the same things happen to our cells .
But life expectancy in this country is only 78 .
These are years that we could get .
Their history actually goes back to about the time of Christ .
It &apos;s actually a Bronze Age culture that &apos;s been isolated .
It &apos;s called Cannonau .
Just look at the advertisements .
That &apos;s called the grandmother effect .
Okinawa is actually 161 small islands .
They have what we want .
They live about seven good years longer than the average American .
Five times as many centenarians as we have in America .
And one sixth the rate of cardiovascular disease .
What do they do ?
More significant than what they eat is how they eat it .
It was invented by Confucius .
We know that isolation kills .
Fifteen years ago , the average American had three good friends .
We &apos;re down to one and half right now .
Their average age is 102 .
There is our work life , where we &apos;re productive .
And then one day , boom , we retire .
They instantly knew why they woke up in the morning .
Two girls separated in age by 101 and a half years .
I thought that was a wonderful thought .
But that &apos;s because all the young people left .
So , we turned to the data again .
Adventists are conservative Methodists .
A &quot; 24-hour sanctuary in time , &quot; they call it .
But for an Adventist woman , their life expectancy is 89 .
This is a heterogeneous community .
It &apos;s white , black , Hispanic , Asian .
They take their diet directly from the Bible .
They take this sanctuary in time very serious .
None of it &apos;s hard . None of it costs money .
Adventists also tend to hang out with other Adventists .
But they influence each other in profound and measurable ways .
This is a culture that has yielded Ellsworth Whareham .
Ellsworth Whareham is 97 years old .
At 97 he still does 20 open-heart surgeries every month .
And then Marge Deton .
Marge is 104 .
Her grandson actually lives in the Twin Cities here .
She starts her day with lifting weights .
She rides her bicycle .
I &apos;ve been on 19 hardcore expeditions .
So , what are the common denominators in these three cultures ?
What are the things that they all do ?
And we managed to boil it down to nine .
Sardinians live in vertical houses , up and down the stairs .
They don &apos;t have any conveniences .
That &apos;s physical activity .
Each of these cultures take time to downshift .
The Sardinians pray . The Seventh-Day Adventists pray .
The Okinawans have this ancestor veneration .
There &apos;s no longevity diet .
They tend to eat a plant-based diet .
And then the foundation of all this is how they connect .
Murray Gell- The ancestor of language
Well , I &apos;m involved in other things , besides physics .
In fact , mostly now in other things .
One thing is distant relationships among human languages .
And the professional , historical linguists in the U.S.
How many tens of thousands of years does it go back ?
Well , Philip Anderson may have been right .
You may just know more about everything than anyone .
But trust me , I work in advertising .
It &apos;s actually Bitcoin .
No one knows who or what he is .
He &apos;s almost like the Banksy of the Internet .
So it &apos;s not run by the authorities or the state .
It &apos;s actually managed by the network .
And I find that sort of scary .
So you think about loyalty .
Loyalty essentially is a micro-economy .
You think about rewards schemes , air miles .
It &apos;s 50 percent above the category average .
When they spot Tide , there &apos;s a shortcut .
So that brings me back to the connection with sweat .
This is literally a closed environment , a closed auction space .
And you think , is it much of a leap ?
There were 8,000 kinds of notes in America .
Is technology making paper money feel outmoded ?
Are we decoupling money from the government ?
Corporations are filling gaps that governments can &apos;t afford to fill .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Maya Beiser : A cello with many voices
Thank you .
It all became music to me .
I didn &apos;t hear the boundaries .
I still start every day practicing playing Bach .
His music never ceases to sound fresh and surprising to me .
I want to create endless possibilities with this cello .
Skylar Tibbits : The emergence of &quot; 4D printing &quot;
This is me building a prototype for six hours straight .
This is slave labor to my own project .
This is what the DIY and maker movements really look like .
But there is another world .
In infrastructure , let &apos;s just take one example .
Take piping .
We bury them in the ground .
And I don &apos;t mean automated machines .
I don &apos;t just mean smart machines that replace humans .
But I mean programmable materials that build themselves .
We need a few simple ingredients .
And then you need smartly designed interactions .
And then we embed elastic .
So we can study this as a physical , intuitive model .
And we built 500 of these glass beakers .
And we gave them away to all the TEDsters .
This is the polio virus .
You shake it hard and it breaks apart .
The idea was , could we self-assemble furniture-scale objects ?
So remember , I said 4D .
And this is like robotics without wires or motors .
These are parts being printed with multi-material properties .
Here &apos;s the first demonstration .
I &apos;m biased .
So no human interaction .
One of those is in extreme environments .
And space is a great example of that .
Let &apos;s go back to infrastructure .
And we &apos;re developing a new paradigm for piping .
So this isn &apos;t expensive pumps or valves .
This is a completely programmable and adaptive pipe on its own .
Thank you .
Arthur Ganson : Moving sculpture
And the ideas are very disparate .
When I was a child , I started to explore motion .
That &apos;s pretty ambiguous .
I gave myself the problem .
That little gear there switches back and forth to change direction .
And that &apos;s a little found object .
When I see objects , I imagine them in motion .
I imagine what can be said with them .
And that &apos;s the whole piece .
That &apos;s about that big .
Because it could run all the time .
Now , a completely different thought .
I &apos;m always imagining myself in different situations .
I &apos;m imagining myself as a machine .
What would I love ?
I would love to be bathed in oil .
And this one I call &quot; Machine with Grease . &quot;
It &apos;s definitely happy .
So this is a little wire-bending tool .
My life completely changed when I found a spot welder .
And that was that tool .
It completely changed what I could do .
I just like , throw it in .
I mean , real jewelers put little bits of solder in .
So , that &apos;s a finished gear .
But I had a lot of fun .
It means nothing at all .
The object itself just means nothing .
So I &apos;ll just let this chair come down .
Thank you .
Hetain Patel : Who am I ? Think again
I have asked her to translate for me .
Okay .
What makes us who we are anyway ?
He would say things like -- HP : Empty your mind .
Be formless , shapeless , like water .
Now you put water into a cup .
It becomes the cup .
You put water into a bottle , it becomes the bottle .
Put it in a teapot , it becomes the teapot .
Now , water can flow or it can crash .
Be water , my friend .
HP : Don &apos;t imitate my voice .
It offends me .
I have .
He had a side parting and a neat mustache .
At first , it was going very well .
I even started to get discounts in Indian shops .
It didn &apos;t look Indian anymore .
My dad doesn &apos;t even have an Indian accent anymore .
He talks like this now .
So it &apos;s not just my father that I &apos;ve imitated .
I said , &quot; What ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Yes . So ? &quot;
This is my art .
I learned this from Spider-Man .
Thank you .
Jill Bolte Taylor : My stroke of insight
A blood vessel exploded in the left half of my brain .
I essentially became an infant in a woman &apos;s body .
And I have brought for you a real human brain .
So this is a real human brain .
But other than that , the two hemispheres are completely separate .
Our right human hemisphere is all about this present moment .
It &apos;s all about &quot; right here , right now . &quot;
Our left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically .
And our left hemisphere thinks in language .
I need them in the morning . &quot;
You muscles , you relax . &quot;
And all I could detect was this energy -- energy .
We got a problem ! We gotta get some help . &quot;
And I felt this sense of peacefulness .
Oh ! I felt euphoria -- euphoria . It was beautiful .
I gotta focus . &quot;
Can I drive ? Can I drive ? &quot;
This is so cool . &quot; &quot; This is so cool !
&quot; I don &apos;t have time for a stroke ! &quot;
So I gotta call help . I gotta call work . &quot;
And I curl up into a little fetal ball .
I am the life-force power of the universe .
And I thought that was an idea worth spreading .
Tim Leberecht : 3 ways to lose control of your brand
Companies are losing control .
What happens on Wall Street no longer stays on Wall Street .
What happens in Vegas ends up on YouTube .
Reputations are volatile . Loyalties are fickle .
Management teams seem increasingly disconnected from their staff .
Companies are losing control of their customers and their employees .
But are they really ?
They can listen and join the conversation .
They can design for it . But how ?
The album sold more copies than previous releases of the band .
It turned transactions into interactions , and generosity into a currency .
Companies can even give control to hackers .
Take the travel service Nextpedition .
Force them to help others .
Thank you .
Jacqueline Novogratz : Inspiring a life of immersion
They want to be part of it .
They talk about wanting lives of purpose and greater meaning .
I don &apos;t want to disappoint my family or friends . &quot;
I work in global poverty .
Will I be marginalized ?
Will I not make enough money ?
Will I never get married or have children ? &quot;
Your job is only to be human .
And nothing important happens in life without a cost . &quot;
We don &apos;t talk about the sacrifice .
&quot; Better immersion than to live untouched . &quot;
What is the cost of not trying ?
And I met them in the early &apos; 90s .
She was convicted of category one crimes of genocide .
And they &apos;re incredible guys .
And then they created a business plan competition .
Then they decided that they would do TEDx &apos;s .
Alex , in some ways , said it best .
And they &apos;re doing it .
And my hat &apos;s off to you in Kibera .
I know it works .
He stood on moral ground and refused to pay bribes .
It took almost two years just to register the land .
And there &apos;s schools and clinics and shops .
But there &apos;s only one mosque .
Who gets to use the mosque on Fridays ? &quot;
He said , &quot; Long story .
And every day we have a choice .
And she &apos;d say , &quot; I &apos;m not talking . &quot;
What are you saying ? &quot;
We need leaders .
So may each of you live lives of immersion .
Thank you .
Aimee Mullins : Changing my legs - and my mindset
Sheryl Shade : Hi , Aimee . Aimee Mullins : Hi .
Why don &apos;t we start there ?
I won a full academic scholarship out of high school .
So , why don &apos;t you tell that story ?
I played softball for five years growing up .
That &apos;s all I &apos;d ever known .
You were all over the place .
We all saw how hard you were working . &quot;
And so I decided to call the track coach at Georgetown .
He &apos;s just a rather intimidating figure .
That &apos;s all I wanted -- just two practices .
So that &apos;s how I met Frank .
You can run on our women &apos;s track team here . &quot;
And I said , &quot; No , come on . &quot;
You can run with our women &apos;s track team . &quot;
Why don &apos;t you just tell them ?
It was really , really hot .
And he just sat there like this .
My pleas fell on deaf ears , thank god .
And I did . So , he kept me in line .
He kept me on the right track .
It &apos;s now two years that you &apos;ve been running ?
AM : No , a year .
AM : Okay , well , Atlanta .
And so , here I am -- never lost .
And I &apos;m sure of it , you know ?
It was , like , this is my time for shine .
It &apos;s my first international meet .
I wanted to find out times .
&quot; Don &apos;t worry , you &apos;re doing great . &quot;
And Georgetown -- that was great .
All this training -- I had transformed my life .
SS : Why don &apos;t you show them your legs ?
AM : Oh , sure .
AM : Well , these are my pretty legs .
You &apos;ve got to come up and see them .
And , seriously , like , I can wear heels .
SS : You got to pick your height ?
AM : I got to pick my height , exactly .
No , I &apos;ve got so many legs in here .
These are -- do you want to hold that actually ?
SS : Are you a different height ?
AM : In these ?
SS : In these .
AM : It &apos;s a company in San Diego called Flex-Foot .
AM : Yes , we &apos;ll do that .
SS : Yes , there you go .
SS : Can you tell about who designed your other legs ?
They &apos;re also silicon .
This is a really basic , basic prosthetic limb under here .
It &apos;s like a Barbie foot under this .
And this is just a silicon piece of skin .
I mean , they make ears for burn victims .
They do amazing stuff with silicon .
They got someone to come in and saw off the shoes .
I need a little bit off . &quot;
They didn &apos;t even want to go there .
No , these legs are great .
So ... Moderator : That &apos;s it .
SS : That &apos;s Aimee Mullins .
Joshua Walters : On being just crazy enough
My name is Joshua Walters .
I &apos;m a performer .
There &apos;s no audience like this to justify their rehearsal time .
They &apos;re just practicing .
One day they &apos;ll get here .
Okay ? Mmhmm ?
At least that &apos;s what it says on my pen . &quot;
Some of you are in the field , I can see .
I can feel your noise .
When I got out I had a choice .
And there &apos;s a book -- John Gartner .
Some of them committed suicide .
So it wasn &apos;t all the good side of the illness .
Now recently , there &apos;s been development in this field .
Your call . Your call .
And everyone &apos;s somewhere in the middle .
Everyone &apos;s somewhere in the middle .
Maybe no one &apos;s really crazy .
Everyone is just a little bit mad .
How much depends on where you fall in the spectrum .
How much depends on how lucky you are .
Thank you .
Rebecca MacKinnon : Let &apos;s take back the Internet !
We shall prevail .
On January 24th , Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh .
Technology created by innovative companies will set us all free .
His app wasn &apos;t reinstated until he won the Pulitzer Prize .
So here &apos;s the thing .
So here &apos;s the situation .
Today , things are a lot more subtle . &quot;
Welcome to democracy , our Tunisian and Egyptian friends .
So we assume that the Internet is a border-busting technology .
But borders do persist in some parts of cyberspace .
But that &apos;s only half of the story .
And government regulation often isn &apos;t helping all that much .
We need to make the same approach with the Internet .
We also are going to need political innovation .
And what does that look like ?
At the moment , we still don &apos;t know .
Thank you very much .
Sugata Mitra : Build a School in the Cloud
What is going to be the future of learning ?
But the Victorians actually did it .
What they did was amazing .
They created a global computer made up of people .
It &apos;s still with us today .
It &apos;s called the bureaucratic administrative machine .
They made another machine to produce those people : the school .
They must be identical to each other .
The Victorians were great engineers .
I &apos;m not saying they &apos;re broken .
It &apos;s not broken . It &apos;s wonderfully constructed .
What are the kind of jobs that we have today ?
Well , the clerks are the computers .
They &apos;re there in thousands in every office .
They do need to be able to read .
In fact , they need to be able to read discerningly .
How is present-day schooling going to prepare them for that world ?
Well , I bumped into this whole thing completely by accident .
Or should they not ?
And my daughter -- oh , surely she is extra-intelligent . &quot;
What did the poor do wrong ?
The children came running in .
They said , &quot; Why have you put it there ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Just like that . &quot;
And I went away .
So I said , &quot; Yeah , that &apos;s possible . &quot;
I repeated the experiment there .
And they said something very interesting to me .
Here &apos;s a short glimpse from those years .
That &apos;s the first day at the Hole in the Wall .
On your right is an eight-year-old .
To his left is his student . She &apos;s six .
And he &apos;s teaching her how to browse .
So I started publishing .
I &apos;d seen it happen over and over and over again .
They did that , and watch a little bit of this .
Computer : Nice to meet you . Nice to meet you .
Where does it stop ?
I made a hypothesis , a ridiculous hypothesis .
&quot; And anyway , I am going away . &quot;
So I left them for a couple of months .
They &apos;d got a zero . I gave them a test .
So they said , &quot; We haven &apos;t given up .
We look at it every single day . &quot;
So I tested them .
Absurd . But I had to follow the Victorian norm .
Thirty percent is a fail .
So she says , &quot; Absolutely not .
So she says , &quot; What &apos;s that ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Stand behind them .
So she did that for two more months .
The scores jumped to 50 percent .
Here &apos;s Kallikuppam .
Neurons ... communication .
At 12 .
So what are jobs going to be like ?
Well , we know what they &apos;re like today .
What will it be tomorrow ?
But that &apos;s terrible . We are homo sapiens .
Knowing , that &apos;s what distinguishes us from the apes .
But look at it this way .
It took us only 10,000 to make knowing obsolete .
What an achievement that is .
But we have to integrate that into our own future .
Encouragement seems to be the key .
There is evidence from neuroscience .
Punishment and examinations are seen as threats .
Why did they create a system like that ?
Because it was needed .
If you didn &apos;t , you failed .
But the Age of Empires is gone .
What happens to creativity in our age ?
We need to shift that balance back from threat to pleasure .
I came back to England looking for British grandmothers .
I got 200 in the first two weeks .
I know more British grandmothers than anyone in the universe .
They &apos;re called the Granny Cloud .
The Granny Cloud sits on the Internet .
She goes on over Skype and she sorts things out .
She does it with only one age-old gesture .
&quot; Shhh . &quot;
Okay ?
Watch this .
Grandmother : You can &apos;t catch me . You say it .
You can &apos;t catch me .
Children : You can &apos;t catch me .
Grandmother : Well done ! Very good .
SM : So what &apos;s happening here ?
It &apos;s not about making learning happen .
It &apos;s about letting it happen .
I think that &apos;s what all this is pointing at .
Well , I intend to build these Self-Organized Learning Environments .
They are basically broadband , collaboration and encouragement put together .
I &apos;ve tried this in many , many schools .
Here &apos;s a SOLE in action .
This one is in England .
SM : A decade ahead of her time .
You already heard about that . You know what that means .
We &apos;ve brought it down to the tangent of an angle .
But that &apos;s not sexy enough .
So here are a couple of images from SOLEs .
This one is about what happens to the air we breathe .
This is done by children without the help of any teacher .
So what &apos;s my wish ?
My wish is that we design the future of learning .
So we need to design a future for learning .
Help me build this school .
It will be called the School in the Cloud .
It &apos;s a facility which is practically unmanned .
There &apos;s only one granny who manages health and safety .
The rest of it &apos;s from the cloud .
But I want you for another purpose .
That &apos;s my wish .
And just one last thing .
I &apos;ll take you to the top of the Himalayas .
And there was this little girl who was following me around .
I don &apos;t know , what should I do ? &quot;
And I was trying to take a picture of her quietly .
I think it was good advice .
I &apos;ll follow her advice . I &apos;ll stop talking .
Thank you . Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you very much . Wow .
Nathan Wolfe : What &apos;s left to explore ?
Recently I visited Beloit , Wisconsin .
He was quite a figure .
Don &apos;t try that one .
But is that really the case ?
This is an explorer of the unseen world , Martinus Beijerinck .
He came up with a name for his mystery agent .
He called it the virus -- Latin for &quot; poison . &quot;
But we &apos;d also see something very , very surprising .
Basically we have no clue what this is .
And there &apos;s a lot of it .
At first we thought that perhaps this was artifact .
These deep sequencing tools are relatively new .
Thank you .
Daniel Tammet : Different ways of knowing
It &apos;s a rare condition .
I can see it in their eyes .
They want to ask me something .
I want to talk to you briefly about perception .
Here are three questions drawn from my work .
I &apos;m an extreme example of this .
One is a flash of white light .
Six is a tiny and very sad black hole .
Three is green .
Four is blue .
Five is yellow .
I paint as well .
And here is one of my paintings .
It &apos;s a multiplication of two prime numbers .
What about bigger numbers ?
It &apos;s an infinite number -- literally goes on forever .
But it &apos;s not only numbers that I see in colors .
And Nabokov was himself synesthetic .
Another example : a little bit more mathematical .
64 multiplied by 75 .
What about 75 ?
64 becomes 6,400 .
Four across , four up and down -- it &apos;s 16 .
Easy when you know how .
The second question was an Icelandic word .
So let me narrow the choices down to two .
is it a happy word , or a sad word ?
What do you say ?
Okay .
Some people say it &apos;s happy .
Most people , a majority of people , say sad .
And it actually means sad .
Let &apos;s have a look at the third question .
It &apos;s a line from a poem by John Keats .
It can also mean the fibers that grow from a head .
They yield to the slightest movement or motion or emotion .
So what you have is an atmosphere of vulnerability and tension .
Thank you .
Kees Moeliker : How a dead duck changed my life
The building was a true bird-killer .
This is the dead duck . It flew against the window .
It &apos;s laying dead on its belly .
Both are of the male sex .
And then this happened .
Well , I &apos;m a biologist . I &apos;m an ornithologist .
I said , &quot; Something &apos;s wrong here . &quot;
I look . Both are of the male sex .
Homosexual necrophilia .
I didn &apos;t have the framework .
And here &apos;s the situation again .
And here are the ducks again .
But then something good happened .
That &apos;s a good thing , so I accepted the prize .
He called me from Cambridge , Massachusetts .
Real Nobel laureates hand you the prize .
That &apos;s the first thing .
And there are nine other winners who get prizes .
Dan , where are you ? Dan Ariely ?
Applause for Dan .
This is its first time on the U.S. West Coast .
I &apos;m going to pass it around .
Yeah ?
You can pass it around .
After winning this prize , my life changed .
This is a moose .
This is in Montana , 2008 .
This is a frog that tries to copulate with a goldfish .
This is the Netherlands , 2011 .
These are cane toads in Australia .
This is roadkill .
Please note that this is necrophilia .
It &apos;s remarkable : the position .
The missionary position is very rare in the animal kingdom .
These are pigeons in Rotterdam .
Barn swallows in Hong Kong , 2004 .
So what does this mean ?
And here you see a dead duck .
So there goes my theory of necrophilia .
This is Mad Max , a blackbird who lives in Rotterdam .
Here he goes , and here &apos;s a short video .
So what this bird does is fight his own image .
That &apos;s on June 5 every year .
Thank you .
Oh , sorry .
May I have my duck back , please ?
Thank you .
Dennis Hong : Making a car for blind drivers
We have already an autonomous vehicle .
We couldn &apos;t have been more wrong .
It was an absolutely amazing experience .
So how does it work ?
So we have three steps .
We have perception , computation and non-visual interfaces .
For that , we use an initial measurement unit .
And we also use three laser range finders .
Now the first interface is called a DriveGrip .
Another device is called SpeedStrip .
But the problem is these are instructional cue devices .
So this is not really freedom , right ?
We call this the &quot; backseat-driver problem . &quot;
So think of it as a monitor for the blind .
So it &apos;s actually a multi-dimensional user interface .
So basically that &apos;s how it works .
We also had some surprises . Let &apos;s take a look .
This is an historic day in January .
He &apos;s coming up to the grandstand , fellow Federationists .
There &apos;s the grandstand now .
Well there comes the first box .
Now let &apos;s see if Mark avoids it .
He does . He passes it on the right .
Third box is out . The fourth box is out .
And he &apos;s perfectly making his way between the two .
Dennis Hong : I &apos;m so happy for you .
Mark Riccobono : Yes .
You must be out of your mind . &quot;
And I truly believe that this can happen .
How are we going to handle insurance ?
How are we going to issue driver &apos;s licenses ?
This is priceless .
Thank you very much .
Quyen Nguyen : Color-coded surgery
In fact , medicine today is a team sport .
And in many ways , it always has been .
We need to shine light to see what we &apos;re doing .
This is Mass General in Boston .
And do you know where the operating room is ?
And this is what I think is the magic of fluorescence .
So let me back up a little bit .
Nerves are yellow , arteries are red , veins are blue .
That &apos;s so easy anybody could become a surgeon , right ?
This is how we excise cancers .
And we wait .
And that may be 20 minutes later per piece .
Please go cut that piece out . &quot;
And this whole process : &quot; Okay you &apos;re done .
We think the entire tumor is out . &quot;
There &apos;s still cancer in your patient . &quot;
The molecule they had developed had three parts .
Nothing will be specific .
There &apos;s no specificity there .
So they added two additional components .
The molecule passes through and gets excreted .
Can you tell where the tumor is ?
I couldn &apos;t when I was working on this .
But here it is . It &apos;s fluorescent .
Now it &apos;s green .
The light that the fluorescence emits can go through tissue .
And I &apos;m peeling that muscle away .
that &apos;s labeled with fluorescent molecules .
And this works for metastatic lymph nodes also .
the gas station has gas .
So that takes more time .
Patients are still on the operating room table .
Anesthesiologists , surgeons are waiting around .
That takes time .
So with our technology , we can tell right away .
You see a lot of little , roundish bumps there .
That doesn &apos;t mean that there &apos;s cancer inside .
Well you can see this on an MRI .
So it &apos;s very important to avoid inadvertent injury .
And what I &apos;m talking about are nerves .
They are traced just by their known anatomical path along vasculature .
And at first this didn &apos;t get a lot of support .
What &apos;s the problem ?
We haven &apos;t had that many complications . &quot;
But I went ahead anyway .
And Roger helped me .
And he brought his whole team with him .
So there &apos;s that teamwork thing again .
And we eventually discovered molecules that were specifically labeling nerves .
You can see where they are .
You see what looks like little Medusa heads coming out .
We &apos;ve been able to see every single nerve .
When we put these two probes together ...
So here &apos;s a tumor .
Do you guys know where the margins of this tumor is ?
Now you do .
What about the nerve that &apos;s going into this tumor ?
That white portion there is easy to see .
But what about the part that goes into the tumor ?
Do you know where it &apos;s going ?
Now you do .
This was a bit of a breakthrough .
We received commentary in Discover magazine , in The Economist .
And we showed it to a lot of my surgical colleagues .
They said , &quot; Wow !
I have patients who would benefit from this .
The eventual goal is that we &apos;ll get this into patients .
We are focused on making this technology better .
I &apos;d like to leave you with this final thought .
Successful innovation is not a single breakthrough .
It is not a sprint .
It is not an event for the solo runner .
Thank you very much .
Johanna Blakley : Lessons from fashion &apos;s free culture
I heard this amazing story about Miuccia Prada .
She &apos;s an Italian fashion designer .
She &apos;s turning it inside out .
Her friend says , &quot; Buy it already . &quot;
Well , it turns out that it &apos;s actually not illegal .
But if you go to Santee Alley , yeah .
Well , yeah .
Canal Street , I know .
And sometimes these are fun , right ?
This is Vivienne Westwood . No !
We think of it as maybe too silly , too unnecessary .
They &apos;re also notorious for riffing off of the zeitgeist .
Maybe just a little .
Can &apos;t copyright a costume either .
Here &apos;s what he had to say .
Johanna Blakley : Imagine that .
This is a very different demographic .
There &apos;s lots of virtues of copying .
For fashionistas , they want to stay ahead of the curve .
I tell you , there is no rest for the fashionable .
And Stuart Weitzman is a very successful shoe designer .
It forced him to be a little more innovative .
And that actually reminded me of jazz great , Charlie Parker .
I love these Gallianos .
Okay , we &apos;ll move on .
This is not unlike the world of comedy .
But now , we have a different kind of comic .
They knock themselves off .
In other countries there is protection for our artful designs . &quot;
In the European Union , they went in the other direction .
Very low novelty standard , anybody can register anything .
So , that does not stop the knock-off artists .
are Nike T-shirts that are almost identical to one another .
But this has not stopped Diane von Furstenberg .
The retailers have kind of quashed this notion though .
Who owns a look ?
That is a very difficult question to answer .
Same with automobiles .
It &apos;s a utilitarian article , that &apos;s why .
Same with furniture , it &apos;s too utilitarian .
Hairdos , no copyright protection .
They thought it &apos;d be more innovative without it .
It &apos;s really hard to get copyright for databases .
They share their designs .
Jokes , no copyright protection .
It ain &apos;t pretty .
It &apos;s embarrassing . &quot;
It is more complex than this , but this will do .
First : Is something an artistic object ?
Then it deserves protection .
Is it a utilitarian object ?
Then no , it does not deserve protection .
This is a difficult , unstable binary .
The other one is : Is it an idea ?
No protection .
It &apos;s a digital file .
They &apos;re smart .
He &apos;s smart , he &apos;s smart .
Thank you so much .
Rory Sutherland : Life lessons from an ad man
It &apos;s held every two years in Burma .
Here is my naive advertising man &apos;s suggestion .
Now , here is another naive advertising man &apos;s question again .
So I &apos;ll ask you another question .
What on earth is wrong with placebos ?
They work extraordinarily well .
So , welcome to Oxford , ladies and gentlemen .
But , actually , the point of placebo education is interesting .
So , actually , he tried making it compulsory .
They are absolutely disgusting and they &apos;re good for nothing . &quot;
So he tried plan B.
What he &apos;d effectively done is he &apos;d re-branded the potato .
It was an absolute masterpiece .
Now , boring people would have just simply banned the veil .
Ataturk was a lateral thinker .
He made it compulsory for prostitutes to wear the veil .
What Ataturk realized actually is two very fundamental things .
all value is actually relative .
All value is perceived value .
As an advertising man , I have to admire that .
But the first thing is that all value is subjective .
Second point is that persuasion is often better than compulsion .
You start with 12 and they take them away .
Not so in Italy .
And it was replaced with replica jewelry made of cast iron .
It was made of cast iron .
So , the modern equivalent would of course be this .
If you think about it , Shakerism was a proto-environmental movement .
Now , we basically have to change our views slightly .
It involves limited raw materials .
It patently veers toward propaganda .
Nowadays , the user is actually involved .
Although it &apos;s called agriculture in the world of food .
In the world of food we call it cooking .
This is mobile food . British are very good at that .
We invented the whole lot of them .
Finally , we have contextual communication .
Unicum in Hungary , for example .
I &apos;ll give you one example .
Yet we &apos;ve never created the opportunity for impulse saving .
If you did this , more people would save more .
Now , I &apos;ve got an example here from Canada .
Shreddies is supposed to be square .
Have any of these diamond shapes gone out ?
Voiceover : New Diamond Shreddies cereal .
Same 100 percent whole-grain wheat in a delicious diamond shape .
I would say it &apos;s a work of genius .
So they are introducing new Diamond Shreddies .
Weren &apos;t they square ?
They -- Yeah , it &apos;s all in the appearance .
But a six is very different from a nine .
Just try both of them .
Take a square one there , first .
Which one did you prefer ? The first one .
The first one ?
Rory Sutherland : Now , naturally , a debate raged .
So drink your wine blind in the future .
Two quotations to more or less end with .
Because they help people share news .
They give badge value to everyday little trivial activities .
Thank you very much indeed .
Diane Benscoter : How cults rewire the brain
My journey to coming here today started in 1974 .
That &apos;s me with the funny gloves .
I was 17 and going on a peace walk .
They were called deprogrammers .
And after about five long years my family had me deprogrammed .
And I then became a deprogrammer .
I started going out on cases .
Most of the cases I went out on were called involuntary .
And so they took them to some safe place .
And about 20 years went by .
There was a burning question though that would not leave me .
And in fact , what did happen to my brain ?
Because something did .
It was on Jonestown .
And it had a chilling effect on me .
These are the dead in Jonestown .
Their mates were chosen for them .
The bottom picture is Hitler youth .
This is the leg of a suicide bomber .
I understand how this could happen .
And so what is this ? How does this work ?
I was really idealistic .
What happens is that circular logic takes over .
&quot; Moon is one with God .
God is going to fix all the problems in the world .
All I have to do is humbly follow .
It becomes impenetrable .
And it makes anything possible , makes anything rationalizable .
We &apos;re beginning to look inside the brain .
Thank you very much .
Ramona Pierson : An unexpected place of healing
So bear with me as I take you through this journey .
She ended up underneath the car .
I ended up with blunt chest trauma .
Your aorta comes up behind your heart .
It foamed , and horrible things were happening to me .
Somehow I ended up at the hospital .
18 months later I woke up .
I was 64 lbs .
And in fact , they started to call me a Gomer .
That &apos;s another story we won &apos;t even get into .
Some things worked , some things didn &apos;t .
But eventually I started to look human again .
I had more than 50 surgeries .
But who &apos;s counting ?
Everybody lost faith in me being able to recover .
And I needed that wisdom at that moment in my life .
I was bald .
I was wearing hospital scrubs .
And somebody donated tennis shoes for me .
This kid needs a lot of work . &quot;
So I had to go through trying to eat again .
And they went through that process .
She is sleeping in the corner of this apartment . &quot;
And then the next thing that I needed was a makeover .
But I did say no to the blue hair .
You learn things unconsciously .
So I acted like a two-year-old and refused to work .
But the men had a better idea .
They were going to make it fun for me .
So I moved on from there .
The redundancy was actually good for me .
So we &apos;ll just keep moving on .
So close your eyes .
Now imagine you have to cross a street .
So there were two obstacles I had to get through .
One was post-traumatic stress disorder .
If it &apos;s hit , don &apos;t cross the street . &quot;
Made perfect sense .
10 years later I gained my sight back .
Not magically .
It was actually robotic surgery .
They removed a hematoma from behind my eye .
So I was walking around it .
Thank you so much .
Asher Hasan : My message of peace from Pakistan
Namaste . Salaam .
Shalom . Sat Sri Akal .
Greetings to all of you from Pakistan .
And Pakistan , in this particular vein , is very similar .
But there are many other dimensions to Pakistan .
My name is Abdul Khan . I come from Peshawar .
My name is Meher and this is my friend Irim .
My name is Zamin .
Do you see me on the other side of this fence ?
Do I matter , or really exist for you ?
Do you see me simply smothered in cloth ?
I have come from a place of intense darkness .
And that is why I want to illuminate the world .
My name is Papusay .
My heart and drum beat as one .
A rising tide lifts all boats .
Why should we do this as Indians and Pakistanis ?
We are but two threads cut from the same cloth .
Fantastic . Just stay up here .
That was fantastic .
I found that really moving .
It felt like it was really important .
They went through a lot to get here .
Would the Pakistanis please just stand up please ?
I just really wanted to acknowledge you .
Thank you so much .
Ben Dunlap : The life-long learner
But there it is : &quot; Yo napot , pacak ! &quot;
So , how do I explain this mysterious affinity ?
So , &quot; Yo napot , pacak ! &quot;
His name was Sandor Teszler .
He built one plant after another .
He will not steal from us again . &quot;
And then resumed the beating .
Mr. Teszler hired 16 men : eight white , eight black .
They were to be his seed group , his future foremen .
&quot; No , I reckon I don &apos;t . &quot;
Do you have any other questions ? &quot;
Whenever you hear this , I will be there . &quot;
&quot; Yo napot , Sandor ! &quot;
But they did , they did like each other .
Mr. Milliken said it was not . Dr. Robicsek disagreed .
&quot; Learn as if you &apos;ll live forever . &quot;
As it does , I suspect , that of everybody here .
This is our task ; we know it will be hard .
Sunni Brown : Doodlers , unite !
So I just want to tell you my story .
So I discovered some very interesting things .
In the 19th century , it was a corrupt politician .
No wonder people are averse to doodling at work .
Now it turned out to be Bill Gates &apos; doodle .
And I &apos;m not comfortable with that .
So here &apos;s a new definition for doodling .
That is why millions of people doodle .
They are visual , auditory , reading and writing and kinesthetic .
And I think that is incredible .
And I will go you one further .
In reality , it is one of its greatest allies .
Thank you .
Hans Rosling : Let my dataset change your mindset
I &apos;m going to talk about your mindset .
Does your mindset correspond to my dataset ?
&quot; We learned it in college . &quot;
And what is the definition then ? &quot; The definition ?
Everyone knows , &quot; they say .
But then you know , I press them like this .
Western world is a long life in a small family .
Developing world is a short life in a large family . &quot;
And here you have the dataset .
Exactly what the students said was their concept about the world .
And really this is about the bedroom .
They had small families and long life .
Then the developing countries applied soap and water , vaccination .
And all the developing world started to apply family planning .
But some countries remain back in this area here .
And you can see we still have Afghanistan down here .
We have Liberia . We have Congo .
So we have countries living there .
Look here when I move them forward .
Here we go .
They catch up . There &apos;s Mexico .
Income per person . I can put that here .
And we will then see a completely different picture .
I can go back 200 years in history .
And I can find United States up there .
And I can let the other countries be shown .
And now I have income per person on this axis .
This is instead of studying history for one year at university .
Here we come . And that was the influenza .
It &apos;s still remembered . The fall of life expectancy .
And then we come up . Not until independence started .
Did you note there , that we have Mexico up there ?
And my youngest son , who studied Chinese in Beijing .
But this was 1963 .
It &apos;s not really , really flat .
So , how could we make better sense about this ?
These people go to bed hungry .
And this is the number of people .
And this is how the world changed .
It changed like this .
And it goes over here ?
Probably the world will do this .
and then it will continue forward like this .
And here we have the low income countries where entrepreneurs are .
We have all this at the same time .
Because it &apos;s so different , what has happened there .
And you have huge differences within countries also .
I heard that your departments here were by regions .
And on this axis , GDP .
Then you see Sierra Leone and Mauritius , completely different .
There is such a difference within Sub-Saharan Africa .
Now all your different departments .
East Europe , Latin America , and OECD countries .
We cannot put it into two parts .
It &apos;s Lincoln here , advancing them .
It &apos;s Eisenhower bringing modernity into the countries .
And then it &apos;s United States today , up here .
And we have countries all this way .
At this point I decided to make a pause .
This is very serious .
And they are highly skilled professionals .
And I &apos;m not paid to come here , no .
Look here . This is the world .
With income down there and child mortality .
And what has happened in the world ?
And we had an increase in income .
And how fast has this happened ?
Well , MDG 4 .
Let &apos;s see what Sweden has done .
We used to boast about fast social progress .
That &apos;s where we were , 1900 .
1900 , Sweden was there .
They started very well . They used the aid well .
They vaccinated the kids . They get better water .
I run Sweden the same 16 year period .
5.5 percent . They are faster than the millennium development goal .
And third chance for Sweden , against Brazil here .
This means that the world is converging .
Well the Swedish students protest at this point .
We have to do real-time competition . &quot;
Singapore had twice the child mortality of Sweden .
But then they started to grow their economy .
And they made the social investment . They got away malaria .
All these green countries are achieving millennium development goals .
These yellow are just about to be doing this .
Not simplistic extrapolation .
The blue is Africa .
The size of the bubbles is how many are HIV affected .
You see the tragedy in South Africa there .
About 20 percent of the adult population are infected .
But you also see that there are African countries down here .
There is no such thing as an HIV epidemic in Africa .
And there are others who are extremely high .
They have a very high level . It &apos;s coming down .
Because here , in Congo , there is war .
And here , in Zambia , there is peace .
And it &apos;s really different within each country .
Look at the provinces of Kenya . They are very different .
And this is the situation you see .
It &apos;s similar to other nutritional diseases .
It will never affect a rich person .
We have seen it here in Mozambique .
You never heard about the disease .
Cause crippling throughout the world .
There is still mystery in one billion .
They are still as poor as they &apos;ve ever been .
It &apos;s the World Department .
Jarreth Merz : Filming democracy in Ghana
Ghana felt safe to me as a child .
I was free , I was happy .
In 1979 , I witnessed my first military coup .
We the children had gathered at a friend &apos;s house .
It was a dimly lit shack .
The firing squad aimed , fired -- the general was dead .
Now this was being broadcast live .
I wanted to blend in like a chameleon .
I think it was a tactic of survival .
And it worked , or so I believed .
And I felt I was being typecast as an actor .
I was always playing the exotic African .
I was playing the violent African , the African terrorist .
I wanted to document on film the 2008 presidential elections .
So here I was , December 7th , 2008 .
He said that his vote was in his heart .
The candidates were back on the road ; they were campaigning .
The rhetoric of the candidates , of course , changed .
The heat was on .
And then the cliche came to haunt us .
We witnessed the eruption of violence in the streets .
People were being beaten brutally .
The army started firing their guns . People were scrambling .
It was complete chaos .
They were chanting , &quot; We want peace .
We want peace . &quot;
And I realized it had to come from the people .
After all , they decide , and they did .
The sounds of the voices were harmonious .
So it could happen .
A democracy could be upheld peacefully .
Now here &apos;s an interesting comparison .
I mean , it was so incredibly close .
And guess what , it worked .
And yes , we Africans can .
Thank you .
Johnny Lee : Free or cheap Wii Remote hacks
And they actually use the Nintendo Wii remote .
This is Adobe Photoshop .
Thank you .
So let &apos;s switch back to that .
Thank you .
So thank you very much .
Wes Moore : How to talk to veterans about the war
I didn &apos;t come from a military family .
I &apos;m not a military brat .
I &apos;m going to send you to military school . &quot;
And it never worked .
And I kept on getting lost .
And I thought about the people who I respected and admired .
There really wasn &apos;t a whole lot going on .
I didn &apos;t ever feel like I was in danger .
That was the new reality .
I signed up because college was expensive .
A lot of my soldiers signed up for completely different reasons .
They signed up because of a sense of obligation .
They signed up because their family said this was important .
They signed up because they wanted some form of revenge .
They signed for a whole collection of different reasons .
And now we all found ourselves overseas fighting in these conflicts .
This is even before I deployed .
But I really had no idea what that even meant .
I just said it because it sounded right .
&quot; Thank you for your service . &quot;
It keeps playing out in all of our minds .
It plays out in all of our memories .
It plays out in all of our emotions .
I wanted people to ask me about my experiences .
What was the experience like ? How are you doing ? &quot;
He loses his leg in Iraq .
She barely survives .
We signed up because we love this country we represent .
So thank you for your service .
After some success , we &apos;ve hit a big hurdle .
Can we simply print money for aid ?
&quot; Surely not . &quot;
It &apos;s a common reaction .
It &apos;s a quick talk .
Others channel John McEnroe .
&quot; You cannot be serious ! &quot;
On the left , we have Pia .
She lives in England .
Dorothy , on the right , lives in rural Kenya .
You &apos;ll all agree with me , I &apos;m sure .
The U.N. agrees too .
History suggests not .
There &apos;s also been some success .
But a lot remains to be done in two years .
One in eight remain hungry .
So what can be done ?
Well , I work in financial markets , not development .
It gives me a different angle on the aid issue .
They funded these purchases with money they created themselves .
The money wasn &apos;t actually physically printed .
But the amount created was unprecedented .
Three times !
They bought fixed income securities , bonds .
They bought equities too .
That confidence was based on two pillars .
Secondly , inflation simply never became a threat .
It was the same elsewhere .
So how does all this relate to aid ?
Brilliant .
Let &apos;s call this scheme &quot; Print Aid . &quot;
And here &apos;s how it might work .
So far so good .
How risky is this ?
It sounds more inflationary already , doesn &apos;t it .
But there are two important mitigating factors here .
Are you read for this ?
There was no inflation .
Would the risks really be that different ?
To me , it &apos;s not that clear .
What is clear is the impact on aid .
Now , we don &apos;t get to 0.7 percent .
Governments are still incentivized to give .
Imagine what we could do with 40 percent more funding .
We might be able to feed the front row .
That may not always be the case .
Today there are universally agreed aims for international aid .
That may not always be the case .
So , can we print money for international aid ?
I seriously believe the question should be , why not ?
Thank you very much .
Martin Hanczyc : The line between life and not-life
But it &apos;s very simple . It &apos;s very simplistic .
We consider first that life has a body .
Now this is necessary to distinguish the self from the environment .
Life also has a kind of inheritable information .
This is how we can start to make a protocell .
We use this idea called self-assembly .
Likewise , we can work with oil and water systems .
So that &apos;s just forming some body stuff , right ?
Some architectures .
What about the other aspects of living systems ?
We started with a natural occurring clay called montmorillonite .
This is natural from the environment , this clay .
It forms a surface that is , say , chemically active .
It could run a metabolism on it .
So we &apos;re on a road towards living systems .
So , something is missing .
Some things are missing .
You add the droplet to the system .
So I add some food source to the system .
The protocell moves . It encounters the food .
We &apos;re going to make two different kinds .
And we just put these two together in the same system .
That didn &apos;t happen before . There it goes .
There &apos;s a protocell AB now in this system .
But then something even more interesting happens .
Just with blobs of chemicals , again .
Think of it like a primordial ooze , okay ?
But they have lifelike properties , is the point .
This is a term by Steve Benner .
But these protocells satisfy these general requirements of living systems .
Cameron Sinclair : My wish : A call for open-source architecture
I &apos;m going to take you on a journey very quickly .
That led to 550 entries from 53 countries .
We also have designers from around the world that participate .
And we had an exhibit of work that followed that .
2004 was the tipping point for us .
And then also I will go into some more projects .
2005 Mother Nature kicked our arse .
So this is a brief overview .
It was all coming into my laptop and cell phone .
Because I believe there is no such thing as Utopia .
All problems are local . All solutions are local .
OK , because I &apos;m going to do it very quick .
I &apos;m adding that to my time .
We can talk about FEMA , but that &apos;s another talk .
So here &apos;s a select number of projects .
This is a shipping container . Built and works .
Using rubble from destroyed homes to create new homes .
Using straw bale construction , creating heat walls .
And then something remarkable happened in &apos; 99 .
And we started engaging the medical community .
We just don &apos;t know how to show this . &quot;
So you know , this is a serious solution .
Every one of these projects is sustainable .
That &apos;s not because I &apos;m a tree-hugging green person .
You have to know where your energy is coming from .
You have to know where your resource is coming from .
And you have to keep the maintenance down .
This is our home ground .
I can see Chris looking at me slyly .
This is a 370-dollar shelter that can be easily assembled .
This is a community-designed community center .
Here is another school .
A class , three classrooms and rainwater collection is 5,000 dollars .
This was raised by hot chocolate sales in Atlanta .
It &apos;s built by the parents of the kids .
The kids are out there on-site , building the buildings .
So , disaster hits home .
We &apos;ve had over 1,500 volunteers rebuilding , rehabbing homes .
This is a rehabbed home , done in four days .
600 bucks , happened two days ago .
We put together very quickly a washroom .
This is the new U.N. tent , just introduced this year .
I was 12 years old . There &apos;s a problem here .
Luckily , we &apos;re not alone .
More hemp houses -- it &apos;s a theme in Japan apparently .
I &apos;m not sure what they &apos;re smoking .
This guy designed for NASA , is now doing housing .
So this is all done in the last two years .
I showed you something that took 20 years to do .
Chris Luebkeman will tell you why .
What I see is many , many inventors .
One billion people live in abject poverty .
We hear about them all the time .
Four billion live in growing but fragile economies .
One in seven live in unplanned settlements .
How do we improve the living standards of five billion people ?
With 10 million solutions .
CS : That &apos;s my wish .
That &apos;s his wish !
So Chris somehow decided to give me 100,000 .
So why not this many people ?
Open-source architecture is the way to go .
Secondly , what will this thing be ?
So Creative Commons has developed the developing nations license .
That &apos;s too late . We need to do it now .
So doing that globally .
And I want this whole thing to work multi-lingually .
Just leave it up there for a sec .
I &apos;m fed up of talking about making change .
You only make it by doing it .
We &apos;ve changed FEMA guidelines . We &apos;ve changed public policy .
We &apos;ve changed international response -- based on building things .
Think of free culture -- this is free innovation .
Somebody said this a couple of years back .
I will give points for those who know it .
Thank you .
David Bolinsky : Visualizing the wonder of a living cell
They are ideals that are powerful . They are irreducible .
We don &apos;t want to do that to our students .
So we have an opportunity to really open up education .
And these micro-machines really are at the heart of life .
And these micro-machines power how a cell moves .
They power how a cell replicates . They power our hearts .
They power our minds .
Run the movie , please .
They pass information to each other .
They cause different things to happen inside the cell .
This is the FedEx delivery guy of the cell .
Enjoy the rest of the show . Thank you .
Nature . Beauty . Gratitude .
So I started shooting time-lapse photography .
Their beauty immerses us with color , taste , touch .
It also provides a third of the food we eat .
Nature &apos;s beauty is a gift that cultivates appreciation and gratitude .
You think this is just another day in your life ?
It &apos;s given to you . It &apos;s a gift .
Look at the sky .
We so rarely look at the sky .
We just think of good weather and bad weather .
Open your eyes . Look at that .
Look at the faces of people whom you meet .
You flip a switch and there is electric light .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Eddy Cartaya : My glacier cave discoveries
Okay , a few of you .
So what is a glacier ?
Now this is Brent McGregor , my cave exploration partner .
This is me looking into the entrance crevasse .
So how do you map a cave ?
This cave was amazing .
But there are some really cool things in there .
For example , this is a noble fir seed we found .
Thank you very much .
Dan Cobley : What physics taught me about marketing
Who studied some physics in university ?
Pretty good . And at school ?
Okay , lots of you .
So , physics and marketing .
Now , who remembers Heisenberg &apos;s uncertainty principle ?
Getting a little more technical now .
By measuring it , the act of measurement changes it .
The act of observation changes it .
It &apos;s the same in marketing .
So with the act of observing consumers , changes their behavior .
Think about Toyota .
Well , you know the story .
The same is true of marketing .
But where we are today , things have changed .
But then you lose control of it .
Your brand starts being dispersed , it gets more chaotic .
It &apos;s out of your control .
I actually saw him speak -- he did a good job .
The message for marketing is that your brand is more dispersed .
Thank you .
Birke Baehr : What &apos;s wrong with our food system
I must admit , I used to be one of them .
What I discovered was this is not true .
I discovered the dark side of the industrialized food system .
First , there &apos;s genetically engineered seeds and organisms .
The seeds are then planted , then grown .
And most folks don &apos;t even know they exist .
These include kidney inflammation and lesions and increased kidney weight .
And let me tell you , corn is in everything .
This is what I found out .
I discovered that there &apos;s a movement for a better way .
I decided that I &apos;d rather be an organic farmer instead .
Thank you .
Now I know definitely which one I would choose .
I try to share this everywhere I go .
Thank you .
Brenda Laurel : Games for girls
Why is that ?
It can &apos;t just be a giant sexist conspiracy .
These people aren &apos;t that smart .
There &apos;s six billion dollars on the table .
They would go for it if they could figure out how .
So , what is the deal here ?
Then we formed a spin-off company .
Girl 1 : Yeah , my character is usually a tomboy .
Hers is more into boys .
Girl 2 : Uh , yeah .
Girl 2 : Divorced -- parents divorced , maybe .
Girl 3 : This is my pretend &#91; unclear &#93; one .
Girl 4 : We make a school newspaper on the computer .
But she gives my sister everything .
Let &apos;s hope it &apos;s really stable .
This is the second day in Rockett &apos;s life .
Miko : Hey Rockett ! C &apos;mere !
Rockett : Hi Miko ! What &apos;s going on ?
She asked me to make sure you knew about it .
Miko : I don &apos;t think so .
Rockett : Really ? What other party ?
He &apos;s invited all the best people .
OK , so we &apos;re going to emotionally navigate .
Oops , I turned the wrong way .
But you get the general idea of the product .
We love them .
We see them .
But we &apos;re really , really happy about who they are .
It turns out they &apos;re really great .
&quot; Rockett 28 ! &quot;
Thanks .
Sue Austin : Deep sea diving ... in a wheelchair
I &apos;d seen my life slip away and become restricted .
It was like having an enormous new toy .
Just being out on the street was exhilarating .
A part of me had become alienated from myself .
The wheelchair became an object to paint and play with .
For me , the wheelchair becomes a vehicle for transformation .
You &apos;re all part of the artwork too .
Patrick Chappatte : The power of cartoons
So yeah , I &apos;m a newspaper cartoonist -- political cartoonist .
It &apos;s a sort of paper-based reader .
You know what they say ?
But this is no news , right ?
You &apos;ve read about it already .
Ladies and gentlemen , the world has gotten smaller .
And you know the reason why , of course .
This is because of technology -- yeah .
Any computer designers in the room ?
That makes a good cartoon .
There &apos;s nothing I can do as a cartoonist .
Well , I know the world is flat now .
That &apos;s true .
Every village in Africa now has a cyber cafe .
Don &apos;t go asking for a Frappuccino there .
So we are bridging the digital divide .
The Third World is connected , we are connected .
And what happens next ?
Well , you &apos;ve got mail .
Yeah .
Well , the Internet has empowered us .
And they were not used to that in communist 2.0 Vietnam .
And technology has set us free -- this is free WiFi .
But yeah , it has liberated us from the office desk .
This is your life , enjoy it .
They are shaping the way we consume .
They are shaping our very desires .
You will not like it .
And technology has even changed our relationship to God .
Now I shouldn &apos;t get into this .
This was so sickening ; people died because of cartoons .
This is not how it works . &quot;
They wanted to stir up controversy .
You know the story .
We know that cartoons can be used as weapons .
And here we are now .
This got me thinking .
This looks like a giant hamburger .
You don &apos;t want to be the ham in the middle .
I was there to report on that story in cartoons .
So you see the style is different .
This is more serious than maybe editorial cartooning .
I went to places like Gaza during the war in 2009 .
So this is really journalism in cartoons .
You &apos;ll hear more and more about it .
This is the future of journalism , I think .
Those were poor guys fighting for their rights .
And I went to see the Dozo .
The Dozo , they are the traditional hunters of West Africa .
People fear them -- they help the rebellion a lot .
They are believed to have magical powers .
They can disappear and escape bullets .
&quot; Another time . &quot;
And what can a cartoonist do ?
So the idea was pretty simple .
We brought together cartoonists from all sides in Ivory Coast .
We took them away from their newspaper for three days .
Show the positive power of cartoons .
And cartoons can cross boundaries , as you have seen .
And I &apos;m very proud of what they did .
And I didn &apos;t ask them to do nice cartoons .
The first day , they were even shouting at each other .
So the idea was there .
In Lebanon , it was not a book .
And it worked .
So this was a great project .
He has to keep his job .
And that &apos;s the message I try to convey to them .
Today , tech companies are the world &apos;s largest editors .
Thank you .
Heather Brooke : My battle to expose government corruption
The children looked and were amazed .
They behaved just like the children .
And they made mistakes , too , just like the children .
And so she set about to make it so .
Well , guess what ? I won . Hooray .
So , thank you .
It &apos;s the system which underpins all these other systems .
Well , it just can &apos;t . That &apos;s it .
This is Birgitta Jónsdóttir . She &apos;s an Icelandic MP .
You know , they &apos;re just not going to get it .
Another rather large investigation is around world diplomacy .
They &apos;re not magic . They are not our parents .
Because that is what Julian Assange did .
You &apos;ve got to have skepticism and humility .
Skepticism , because you must always be challenging .
I want to see the evidence behind why that &apos;s so .
At the moment our rights are incredibly weak .
So that -- yes . Yes ! My power pose .
I would like us to work towards that .
There was no evidence . He presented no evidence of that .
It was just , &quot; Because I say so .
You have to trust me . Take it on faith . &quot;
You &apos;ve got drones now being considered for domestic surveillance .
They &apos;ve kidded out the house with CCTV cameras .
Well , is that a fairy tale or a living nightmare ?
Some fairy tales have happy endings . Some don &apos;t .
Thank you .
Skylar Tibbits : Can we make things that make themselves ?
They &apos;re far more efficient in terms of energy .
They hardly ever make mistakes .
And they can repair themselves for longevity .
So there &apos;s something super interesting about natural systems .
And I think the key to that is self-assembly .
The first two are the MacroBot and DeciBot .
They &apos;re embedded with mechanical electrical devices , sensors .
So this is a NAND gate .
The other one is from the previous brick that was placed .
And then it gives you an output in 3D space .
So that means that we can have some form of self-replication .
If you have errors , you can replace a part .
It &apos;s directly embedded ; there &apos;s no external instructions .
So basically you have a chain of elements .
Each element is completely identical , and they &apos;re biased .
So what does this tell us about the future ?
There &apos;s new programmability in these parts .
And from that you have new possibilities for computing .
We &apos;ll have spatial computing .
So it &apos;s exciting potential for this .
Thank you .
Leyla Acaroglu : Paper beats plastic ? How to rethink environmental folklore
Most people do pick the paper .
Okay , let &apos;s think of why .
It &apos;s brown to start with .
Therefore , it must be good for the environment .
It &apos;s biodegradable . It &apos;s reusable .
In some cases , it &apos;s recyclable .
And I work in design .
So I like to call that intuitive framework our environmental folklore .
It doesn &apos;t tend to be based on any scientific framework .
And we &apos;ve busted a bunch of myths .
Allow me to explain .
Most natural things don &apos;t actually end up in nature .
Landfill is a different environment .
I &apos;m a product designer by trade .
I then did social science .
Now America has this amazing ability to keep growing refrigerators .
And so what happens is , we waste more food .
Half of the world &apos;s produced food is wasted .
I don &apos;t want to make it so simplistic .
You all got crisper drawers ?
The drawer that you put your lettuces in ?
Yeah ? Soggy lettuces ?
It was called the Soggy Lettuce Report .
Okay ? So this is a problem , people .
Okay . You need a tight environment .
Anyway , I &apos;m clearly obsessed .
But essentially , this is a big problem .
The life cycle impact of that lettuce is astronomical .
We &apos;ve had to clear land .
We could start with the crisper drawer and the size .
Forty percent food waste is a major problem .
Imagine if we designed fridges that halved that .
But that &apos;s really big in the U.K.
So they &apos;re very popular .
Because obviously energy &apos;s a problem with this product .
Or , &quot; How do I make it green materials ?
How do I make the materials green in the manufacturing ? &quot;
Would you ask me those questions ?
They seem logical , right ? Yeah .
Because the problem is with use .
It &apos;s with how people use the product .
But this is the thing .
This is what I call a product-person failure .
Simon works for the national electricity company in the U.K.
He &apos;s also watching television .
the moment that very popular TV shows end .
1.5 million kettles , seriously problematic .
There are six billion mobile phone subscriptions as of last year .
They have so much locked up inside them .
as being up to 50 million tons trafficked .
They burn the electronic waste in open spaces .
Design for disassembly , design for light-weighting .
But design is one of the best solutions .
These kinds of products are everywhere .
I &apos;m sure everyone in this room is very innovative .
We want something , therefore we buy it .
Thank you .
Benoit Mandelbrot : Fractals and the art of roughness
Thank you very much .
Please excuse me for sitting ; I &apos;m very old .
There are many different kinds of mess .
But it is not so .
So let me show you a few objects .
Some of them are artificial .
Others of them are very real , in a certain sense .
Now this is the real . It &apos;s a cauliflower .
Well , it &apos;s very interesting .
Now , what did humanity do with that ?
Very , very little .
I said , &quot; Well , just short of 1.5 . &quot;
It was 1.48 .
Now , it didn &apos;t take me any time .
I &apos;ve been looking at these things for so long .
I hasten to say that these surfaces are completely artificial .
To the right , I took a higher roughness .
Humanity had to learn about measuring roughness .
Very few things are very smooth .
Well , you measure and measure and measure .
What &apos;s the length of the coastline of these lakes ?
The closer you measure , the longer it is .
You must do it differently .
What good is that , to know these things ?
Well , surprisingly enough , it &apos;s good in many ways .
We see mountains in the distance .
Now it &apos;s very easy to do .
Now look at that . That &apos;s a real lung .
Now a lung is something very strange .
Anatomists were arguing very much about that .
Enormous disagreements .
Now , what good is it to have that ?
You have formulas that long .
And you crank it several times .
And at the end , you get things like that .
This cloud is completely , 100 percent artificial .
Well , 99.9 .
Now this simple rule is not an explanation of clouds .
The seer of clouds had to take account of it .
Now , here is another thing which is rather interesting .
Mathematicians began to create shapes that didn &apos;t exist .
Well , they do mix .
And well , it &apos;s a story unto itself .
Well actually , I was not silly .
The great painter Hokusai knew it very well .
The things on the ground are algae .
And he was Japanese who had no contact with the West .
But painting for a long time had a fractal side .
I could speak of that for a long time .
The Eiffel Tower has a fractal aspect .
This is a mess , mess , mess , Brownian loop .
I see ; it &apos;s an island . &quot;
And amazing .
I measured it , 1.33 .
Again , again , again .
Long measurements , big Brownian motions , 1.33 .
Mathematical problem : how to prove it ?
It took my friends 20 years .
Three of them were having incomplete proofs .
They got together , and together they had the proof .
What got you in that strange business ? &quot;
To the left you see data over a long period .
There are thousands of books on that .
Now compare that with real price increments .
Where are real price increments ?
And it went really well 50 years ago .
&quot; Well , acts of God .
That is the meat , the problem .
Well , here are the curves for it .
In a way , it &apos;s the story of my life .
My adolescence was spent during the German occupation of France .
And after the war , I saw an uncle again .
Very simple .
This shape is of an extraordinary complication .
It &apos;s so simple , so dry .
It &apos;s so uninteresting .
I mean this comes out .
I don &apos;t want to explain these things .
This comes out . This comes out .
This comes out repeatedly , again , again , again .
And then this one .
The color was added for two reasons .
And if you plot them , you must choose some system .
It &apos;s so complicated .
In 1990 , I was in Cambridge , U.K.
So where did this come from ?
Obviously , from extraterrestrials .
Well , let me finish .
Thank you very much .
Sebastian Junger : Why veterans miss war
How does that work ? What does it mean ?
That &apos;s a sane response to war .
That &apos;s what &apos;s so complicated about war .
That &apos;s the thing that has to be understood .
It was six miles long .
It was very intense .
I spent most of my time up there .
There was no running water .
There was no way to bathe .
The guys were up there for a month at a time .
They never even got out of their clothes .
They fought . The worked .
They slept in the same clothes .
They burned them and got a new set .
There was no Internet . There was no phone .
There was no communication with the outside world up there .
There was no cooked food .
Combat they did learn to like .
It was incredibly hot .
That &apos;s how bored they were .
It &apos;s not what I had expected .
Usually , you &apos;re not scared .
Time slows down .
You get this weird tunnel vision .
It &apos;s almost a slightly altered state of mind .
Young men will go to great lengths to have that experience .
It &apos;s wired into us .
It &apos;s hormonally supported .
They die at six times the rate that young women do .
You can imagine how that plays out in combat .
Half a second later , I heard dut-dut-dut-dut-duh .
It was machine gun fire .
At 400 meters , it missed me by three inches .
Just think about the math on that .
The boys are up there for a year .
They got back .
I was particularly close to a guy named Brendan O &apos;Byrne .
I &apos;m still very good friends with him .
I had a dinner party one night .
&quot; Ma &apos;am , I miss almost all of it . &quot;
What is he talking about ?
He &apos;s not a psychopath .
He doesn &apos;t miss killing people .
I think what he missed is brotherhood .
He missed , in some ways , the opposite of killing .
Now , brotherhood is different from friendship .
Friendship happens in society , obviously .
It didn &apos;t bother him .
They thought he was dead .
It was in the middle of a huge firefight .
The bullet had just knocked him out .
It glanced off the helmet .
And he was thinking , &quot; I &apos;m not dead . &quot;
And he sat up .
That &apos;s brotherhood .
This wasn &apos;t invented recently .
Many of you have probably read &quot; The Iliad . &quot;
That is terrifying .
Thank you very much .
Jake Wood : A new mission for veterans -- disaster relief
The first problem is there &apos;s inadequate disaster response .
And we can use veterans to improve disaster response .
This is Clay Hunt . Clay was a Marine with me .
We served together in Iraq and Afghanistan .
He lost purpose . He lost his community .
And perhaps most tragically , he lost his self-worth .
He joins the Army . The Army gives him a rifle .
They send him to Iraq .
Every day he leaves the wire with a mission .
It &apos;s to keep the men around him alive .
It &apos;s to pacify the village that he works in .
They &apos;ve eaten together . They &apos;ve bled together .
He goes home to Kansas City , Missouri .
He doesn &apos;t have that community anymore .
He joins the Army . The Army gives him a rifle .
They send him to Iraq .
He doesn &apos;t have that same self-worth .
Thank you very much .
Janine Shepherd : A broken body isn &apos;t a broken person
That &apos;s what defined me . That was my bliss .
Life was good .
And then everything went black .
Where was I ? What was happening ?
My body was consumed by pain .
I had extensive and life-threatening injuries .
I &apos;d broken my neck and my back in six places .
I broke five ribs on my left side .
I broke my right arm . I broke my collarbone .
I broke some bones in my feet .
My whole right side was ripped open , filled with gravel .
I had head injures . I had internal injuries .
I was having a really bad day .
For over 10 days , I drifted between two dimensions .
&quot; No . It &apos;s too hard . &quot;
&quot; Come on . This is our opportunity . &quot;
I was at a crossroads .
It was the fight of my life .
They &apos;d have to operate .
The central nervous system nerves , there is no cure .
You &apos;ll have internal injuries for the rest of your life .
I tried to grasp what she was saying .
They moved me from intensive care to acute spinal .
I was lying on a thin , hard spinal bed .
After six months , it was time to go home .
I felt so incredibly grateful for my life .
In the spinal ward , that &apos;s normal .
You &apos;re in a wheelchair . That &apos;s normal .
And I got home and something happened .
I realized Sister Sam was right .
I did get depressed .
And I wanted to give up .
Gone . &quot;
And I realized that this wasn &apos;t just my life .
And then I stopped asking , &quot; Why me ? &quot;
And I started to ask , &quot; Why not me ? &quot;
I had never before thought of myself as a creative person .
I was an athlete . My body was a machine .
I was no longer tied to a set path .
I was free to explore life &apos;s infinite possibilities .
And that realization was about to change my life .
She said , &quot; That &apos;s nice , dear . &quot;
I said , &quot; Pass me the yellow pages . &quot;
Is that a problem ? &quot;
It was beautiful . They lifted me into the cockpit .
They sat me down . There are buttons and dials everywhere .
He went , &quot; Oh . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
And I took the controls , and I was flying .
But at least she always knew where I was .
And sometimes I thought that too .
And then I got my commercial pilot &apos;s license .
And then I got my instructor rating .
And then I thought , &quot; Why stop there ?
Why not learn to fly upside down ? &quot;
And Mom and Dad ? Never been up .
So raise your straws if you &apos;ll join me .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Hans Rosling : The best stats you &apos;ve ever seen
This country over here is China . This is India .
Or have they got longer lives and live up there ?
All the green Latin American countries are moving towards smaller families .
This is India . Indonesia &apos;s moving on pretty fast .
One dollar , 10 dollars or 100 dollars per day .
We heard it in other forms . And who are these ?
Where are the different countries ? I can show you Africa .
And we have most who lived in absolute poverty were Asians .
The linearity is very strong between child survival and money .
In Sierra Leone , humanitarian aid .
But a huge difference between Afghanistan and Sri Lanka .
And here we have high-income countries in the OECD .
And Sheikh Sayed did that in a fairly good way .
The richest 20 percent of Ugandans are there .
Because the data is hidden down in the databases .
You can take a data set and put it there .
We are liberating U.N. data , some few U.N. organization .
The publicly-funded data is down here .
And we would like flowers to grow out on the Net .
He only says , &quot; We can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And that &apos;s a quite clever guy , huh ?
This is the income distribution of China , 1970 .
the income distribution of the United States , 1970 .
Almost like a ghost , isn &apos;t it , huh ?
But this is hypothesis-generating .
Paddy Ashdown : The global power shift
By the way , it happens about once every century .
For power is not just moving laterally from nation to nation .
It &apos;s also moving vertically .
Now that suits the powerful up to a moment .
Now notice , I &apos;m not talking about government .
I &apos;m not talking about setting up some global democratic institution .
The world needs an international forum .
It needs a means by which you can legitimize international action .
Kyoto : the beginnings of struggling to create a treaty-based organization .
And that &apos;s what the G20 is , a treaty-based institution .
And watch that beginning to happen .
But that &apos;s not a usual case in history .
You &apos;re beginning to see the emergence of a multi-polar world .
But that &apos;s a subject of a different discussion .
You see India , you see Brazil .
There was a balance , a five-sided balance .
Britain always played to the balance .
A fixed polarity of power means fixed alliances .
But a multiple polarity of power means shifting and changing alliances .
But that &apos;s no longer true .
Take the last financial crisis after the Second World War .
Now we have to call in others .
Now we have to create the G20 .
Oh yes ? Why not ?
3,700 .
How many Americans ? 11 .
The Chinese naval contingent .
Of course they are , they are a mercantilist nation .
They want to keep the sea lanes open .
And here &apos;s the third factor , which is totally different .
We are now interdependent .
The interrelationship of nations , well it &apos;s always existed .
Diplomacy is about managing the interrelationship of nations .
But now we are intimately locked together .
Lehman Brothers goes down , the whole lot collapses .
We are all now deeply , deeply , deeply interconnected .
That was when the enemy was outside the walls .
Now the enemy is inside the walls .
It &apos;s its capacity to lock together its institutions .
And this tells you something very important .
So here is Ashdown &apos;s third law .
You understand that in industry ; governments don &apos;t .
But now one final thing .
It is no longer the case .
Collective security is not enough .
They shared a destiny with their enemies .
I started with a poem , I &apos;ll end with one .
The great poem of John Donne &apos;s .
&quot; Send not for whom the bell tolls . &quot;
The poem is called &quot; No Man is an Island . &quot;
For John Donne , a recommendation of morality .
Thank you very much .
Stewart Brand : What squatter cities can teach us
Basically , there &apos;s a major demographic event going on .
The aggregate numbers are overwhelming .
The question is , why ?
And these are not really a people oppressed by poverty .
They have home-brewed infrastructure and vibrant urban life .
One-sixth of the GDP in India is coming out of Mumbai .
Education is the main event that can happen in cities .
What &apos;s going on in the street in Mumbai ?
Al Gore knows . It &apos;s basically everything .
There &apos;s no unemployment in squatter cities . Everyone works .
And here &apos;s the second punch line .
Now we &apos;re shining right back up .
Thank you .
Mark Ronson : How sampling transformed music
So what I &apos;m going to do is play this .
This is the song from the TED Talks online .
Ken Robinson : Good morning . How are you ?
Tod Machover : Something nobody &apos;s ever heard before .
I have a crossfader .
Julian Treasure : I call this the mixer .
Two D.J. decks .
You turn up the dials , the wheel starts to turn .
Dan Ellsey : I have always loved music .
Adam Ockelford : In your brain is this amazing musical computer .
And the 21st century .
KR : Turn on the radio . Pop into the discotheque .
Mark Ronson : This is my favorite part .
You gotta have doorstops . That &apos;s important .
TM : We all love music a great deal .
MTT : Anthems , dance crazes , ballads and marches .
Ryan Holladay : Blend seamlessly .
Kathryn Schulz : And that &apos;s how it goes .
MTT : What happens when the music stops ?
Yay !
Neither have I provided electricity to my village through sheer ingenuity .
They seem like a nice person .
You &apos;d certainly learn a lot .
That &apos;s the major thread .
I &apos;d like to play a song for you .
It &apos;s been sampled 547 times .
I do hope that comes back soon .
Anyway , this predated the sampling era .
Doug E. Fresh was the human beat box .
That was 1984 .
It &apos;s Throwback Thursday already .
I was in the middle .
I didn &apos;t care who liked it .
Copyright lawyers are having a field day at this point .
It &apos;s thoroughly modern Biggie .
And so , it &apos;s a groaner .
These records don &apos;t really age that well .
You can &apos;t just hijack nostalgia wholesale .
It leaves the listener feeling sickly .
It runs a risk of being completely bland .
We live in the post-sampling era .
That &apos;s just how it goes .
So I hope you enjoy this . Here we go .
Let &apos;s hear that TED sound again , right ?
Thank you very much . Thank you .
Markham Nolan : How to separate fact and fiction online
And that &apos;s changed irrevocably .
So I wrote a letter .
It was a 7.6 magnitude . It was fairly big .
And that goes for every single person in this room .
They weren &apos;t really sure . It was filtered in Instagram .
The lighting was questioned . Everything was questioned about it .
They were well respected . They were known .
And how do you build a list like that from scratch ?
This visualization was done by an Italian academic .
These are the ones that are obviously making sense .
Let &apos;s see who they are . &quot;
And you have to do that investigative work .
Getting real windy in just a second .
Oh , shit !
This is from Hama .
Three different sources said three different things about the bridge .
They said , one , the bridge doesn &apos;t exist .
So that was the only one that gave us a clue .
We looked through the video for other clues .
We saw the distinctive railings , which we could use .
It had black-and-white curbs .
We &apos;re looking for one that crosses east-west .
They &apos;re yes or no , they &apos;re black or white .
Truth is never binary . Truth is a value .
Thanks very much .
Thandie Newton : Embracing otherness , embracing myself
Embracing otherness .
It &apos;s no longer valid or real .
And that self becomes the vehicle for navigating our social world .
Is it who we really are ?
Or who we really want to be , or should be ?
The self was not constant .
That confirms its existence and its importance .
And it is important .
It has an extremely important function .
Without it , we literally can &apos;t interface with others .
But my skin color wasn &apos;t right .
My hair wasn &apos;t right .
My history wasn &apos;t right .
I was a noticeable nobody .
I &apos;d literally lose myself .
And I was a really good dancer .
I would put all my emotional expression into my dancing .
I applied to read anthropology at university .
&quot; So biology , genetics ? &quot; she said .
&quot; Because , Thandie , that &apos;s not accurate .
Because we all stem from Africa .
On the one hand , result .
Right ?
My desire to disappear was still very powerful .
And of course I did .
I still believed my self was all I was .
It happens when I dance , when I &apos;m acting .
And no matter how other they &apos;re all related in me .
I stopped giving it so much authority .
I give it its due .
I take it to therapy .
I &apos;ve become very familiar with its dysfunctional behavior .
But I &apos;m not ashamed of my self .
In fact , I respect my self and its function .
And if you can do that , incredible things happen .
We knew it from the day we were born .
Let &apos;s not be freaked out by our bountiful nothingness .
Simple awareness is where it begins .
Thank you for listening .
Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie : The danger of a single story
I &apos;m a storyteller .
I grew up on a university campus in eastern Nigeria .
Now , this despite the fact that I lived in Nigeria .
I had never been outside Nigeria .
Never mind that I had no idea what ginger beer was .
But that is another story .
Things changed when I discovered African books .
I started to write about things I recognized .
Now , I loved those American and British books I read .
I come from a conventional , middle-class Nigerian family .
My father was a professor .
My mother was an administrator .
His name was Fide .
So I felt enormous pity for Fide &apos;s family .
I was startled .
Their poverty was my single story of them .
I was 19 .
My American roommate was shocked by me .
Never mind that I knew nothing about places like Namibia .
Now , I &apos;ve laughed every time I &apos;ve read this .
And one must admire the imagination of John Locke .
In fact I did not know what African authenticity was .
My characters drove cars .
They were not starving .
Therefore they were not authentically African .
A few years ago , I visited Mexico from the U.S.
I remember first feeling slight surprise .
And then I was overwhelmed with shame .
I had read Tyler and Updike and Steinbeck and Gaitskill .
I did not have a single story of America .
But I also had grandfathers who died in refugee camps .
My cousin Polle died because he could not get adequate healthcare .
All of these stories make me who I am .
They make one story become the only story .
It makes our recognition of our equal humanity difficult .
I was not only charmed , I was very moved .
Stories matter .
Many stories matter .
Thank you .
Don Levy : A cinematic journey through visual effects
The filmmaker Georges Méliès was first a magician .
Now movies proved to be the ultimate medium for magic .

Oh , you &apos;re wiggling your toes .
Maharaja : Nothing to worry about , not a thing .

Imogen Heap : &quot; Wait It Out &quot;
Hadyn Parry : Re-engineering mosquitos to fight disease
But of course the most dangerous animal is the mosquito .
And the mosquito has killed more humans than wars and plague .
And that &apos;s not really the case .
And dengue fever has grown in speed quite phenomenally .
Now let &apos;s assume you go on holiday .
You might go to India , the Far East .
Well , you could develop flu-like symptoms .
They could be quite mild .
And that &apos;s the nickname given to this disease .
So why is it spreading so fast ?
And the answer is this thing .
This is Aedes aegypti .
That &apos;s two days ago .
So we must be good at killing mosquitos .
I mean , that can &apos;t be very difficult .
Well , there &apos;s two principle ways .
The first way is that you use larvicides .
Now in an urban environment , that &apos;s extraordinarily difficult .
It &apos;s just not practical .
This is a picture of fogging .
You could do the same with a space spray .
We are going to use it in and around humans .
It has to be safe .
Maybe a better product comes along in 20 , 30 years .
Fine . We don &apos;t want a lasting environmental impact .
And finally , you want something that &apos;s species-specific .
Some are quite beneficial . Some are important to your ecosystem .
This one &apos;s not . It &apos;s invaded you .
But you don &apos;t want to get all of the insects .
You just want to get this one .
It &apos;s only the female mosquito that will actually bite you .
It &apos;s just the female .
So basically , we &apos;ve used those two factors .
They only live a few days .
And that &apos;s exactly where we are .
And what &apos;s the result ?
Well , the result has been very good .
We can transport them around the world .
So freight costs aren &apos;t our biggest problem .
There you are . We &apos;ve sent mosquito eggs .
We &apos;ve separated the males from the females .
It &apos;s actually a little bit more precise than that .
We &apos;ve also done this in agriculture .
So for the mosquito , it &apos;s a dead end .
Thank you very much .
Gero Miesenboeck : Re-engineering the brain
I have a doppelganger .
That &apos;s exactly what I do -- optical mind control .
I control the brain in order to understand how it works .
Isn &apos;t that putting the cart before the horse ?
But think for a moment what that means .
Take a look at what brain activity might look like .
In this simulation , each black dot is one nerve cell .
The dot is visible whenever a cell fires an electrical impulse .
There &apos;s 10,000 neurons here .
Your brains are about 100 million times more complicated .
We don &apos;t understand the code used by the brain .
To make progress , we need to break the code .
But how ?
We need to rearrange the pattern .
The more targeted our interventions , the better .
But we &apos;ll certainly learn a lot .
Sticking wires into the brain is obviously rather crude .
I hope you &apos;ll appreciate the beautiful simplicity of this concept .
But these pores here are special .
She cut the heads off of her flies .
They just stand around and groom excessively .
They didn &apos;t get very far , obviously .
And there are now hundreds of labs using these approaches .
Each chamber in these two vertical stacks contains one fly .
Here &apos;s some such CCTV footage .
These decisions are clearly a reflection of the Actor &apos;s policy .
And the logic of our experiment was simple .
The fly should learn to avoid the optically reinforced odor .
Its behavior is completely unchanged .
This is one piece of good news .
Thank you .
Ramsey Musallam : 3 rules to spark learning
I teach chemistry .
All right , all right .
So more than just explosions , chemistry is everywhere .
Some people nodding yes .
The questions and conversations that followed were fascinating .
So when I asked him , he told me three things .
Rule number one : Curiosity comes first .
Rule number two : Embrace the mess .
We &apos;re all teachers . We know learning is ugly .
And rule number three : Practice reflection .
Can we be the surgeons of our classrooms ?
As if what we are doing one day will save lives .
Our students our worth it .
And each case is different .
All right . Sorry .
So these are my daughters .
On the right we have little Emmalou -- Southern family .
And , on the left , Riley .
Yeah . Why .
We all were at that age .
How will they grow this curiosity ?
Thank you very much .
Magnus Larsson : Turning dunes into architecture
Now , as architects we &apos;re trained to solve problems .
The threat is desertification .
Now , sand is a magical material of beautiful contradictions .
It is simple and complex .
It is peaceful and violent .
That &apos;s a cyclical process .
As rocks and mountains die , grains of sand are born .
Some of those grains may then cement naturally into sandstone .
And as the sandstone weathers , new grains break free .
Just south of the Sahara we find the Sahel .
The name means &quot; edge of the desert . &quot;
And this is the region most closely associated with desertification .
This is a catastrophe waiting to happen again .
And it &apos;s one that gets very little attention .
So , we get climate change .
But , how far away is it ?
So , they moved the entire village , hut by hut .
This is where the village used to be .
Trees or cacti are good for this .
This sandstone wall that I &apos;m proposing essentially does three things .
Inside of the dunes we find shade .
Sand dunes are almost like ready-made buildings in a way .
How do we glue those grains of sand together ?
The whole cementation process takes about 24 hours .
He managed to do it in a mere 1,400 minutes .
So , how much would this cost ?
How do we construct something like this ?
Well , I &apos;ll quickly show you two options .
The second alternative would be to use injection piles .
But , what should they look like ?
And I think this creates a kind of boundless beauty actually .
That &apos;s not true at all .
Sand-stopping devices , made from sand .
But , it &apos;s a beginning , it &apos;s a vision .
As Borges would have it , it &apos;s the sand .
Rob Harmon : How the market can keep streams flowing
This is a river .
This is a stream .
This is a river .
This is happening all over the country .
On this map , the colored areas represent water conflicts .
Similar problems are emerging in the east as well .
There are 4,000 miles of dewatered streams in Montana alone .
They would ordinarily support fish and other wildlife .
This is Prickly Pear Creek .
It supports wild fish including cutthroat , brown and rainbow trout .
How did we get here ?
These senior water rights are key .
So they have no incentive to conserve .
It &apos;s a broken system .
Okay . Now I &apos;m going to change gears here .
I mean , there &apos;s water in beer .
So how can they address this remaining water footprint ?
Remember Prickly Pear .
Remember Prickly Pear .
It &apos;s a broken system .
But they have no incentive to do so .
We pay them to leave their water in-stream .
That &apos;s what &apos;s happening here .
Okay ?
He gets paid to leave the water in the stream .
The brewers pay to restore water to the stream .
These transactions create allies , not enemies .
They connect people rather than dividing them .
And they provide needed economic support for rural communities .
And most importantly , it &apos;s working .
Thank you very much .
Robert Lang : The math and magic of origami
My talk is &quot; Flapping Birds and Space Telescopes . &quot;
It ties to origami . So let me start .
What is origami ?
And that is what origami used to be .
But it &apos;s become something else .
It &apos;s become an art form , a form of sculpture .
It shows these women playing with these toys .
Every Japanese kid learns how to fold that crane .
And that might have been the case .
Naturalism . Detail .
And it raises a question : what changed ?
And that leads to a very powerful tool .
Origami revolves around crease patterns .
And you can &apos;t just draw them arbitrarily .
They have to obey four simple laws .
And they &apos;re very simple , easy to understand .
Nothing else .
All of origami comes from that .
If we obey these laws , we can do amazing things .
And I can put it in this simple equation .
What matters is what we mean by those symbols .
And yeah , you really can .
So let me stretch out that equation .
I start with my idea . I abstract it .
Now the first step , pretty easy .
Take an idea , draw a stick figure .
But we &apos;re going to start small .
This base has a lot of flaps in it .
We &apos;re going to learn how to make one flap .
How would you make a single flap ?
What paper went into that flap ?
I can use it for something else .
Well , there are other ways of making a flap .
There are other dimensions for flaps .
There &apos;s other ways of making flaps .
So now we &apos;re ready to scale up .
What do I need ? I need a lot of circles .
And I can use those patterns now to create origami shapes .
Those folds fold into a base . You shape the base .
And it &apos;s so simple .
It &apos;s so simple that a computer could do it .
Or you could do a moose .
Or , really , any other kind of deer .
These techniques revolutionized this art .
She &apos;s eating him .
I call it &quot; Snack Time . &quot;
And you can do more than just insects .
This tree frog has toes .
You can make multiple subjects .
So these are a couple of instrumentalists .
Do a little more complicated instrument . &quot;
Well , then you could do an organ .
And what this has allowed is the creation of origami-on-demand .
But I want to show you some examples .
Just to show you , this really was folded paper .
And I want to show you some of these examples .
And he used it to design this solar array .
They certainly didn &apos;t need to talk to origami artists .
They called it the Eyeglass .
So , imagine a lens the size of a football field .
How do you make a large sheet of glass smaller ?
So you have to do something like this .
This was a small model .
Now , there is other origami in space .
And this example is the latter .
And they want to do their design by simulation .
And so they can do a simulation like this .
And that leads to a really interesting idea .
You know , where did these things come from ?
It &apos;s the same pattern , called the water bomb base .
Thanks .
Barry Schwartz : Using our practical wisdom
Ken and I have been working together for almost 40 years .
That &apos;s Ken Sharpe over there .
Our kids &apos; teachers seem to be failing them .
They almost brought the entire financial system down .
They don &apos;t understand us .
They don &apos;t have the time to get to know us .
Rules and incentives -- &quot; sticks &quot; and &quot; carrots . &quot;
We &apos;ll see .
Why ? Because bankers are smart people .
We need character .
We need people who want to do the right thing .
So what do they do ?
They fashion a novel solution to the problem .
Wise people know when and how to bend the rules .
Wise people know how to improvise .
A wise person knows when to bend the rules .
A wise person knows when to improvise .
It &apos;s the case of Michael .
Michael &apos;s a young guy .
He had a pretty low-wage job .
Then he lost his job .
He panicked about being able to support his family .
He robbed him at gunpoint .
It was a toy gun .
He got caught . He got tried .
He got convicted .
He had never committed a crime before .
He was a responsible husband and father .
He had been faced with desperate circumstances .
All this would do is wreck a family .
He did . He served out his sentence .
He made restitution and found himself a new job .
And the family was united .
And he asked for the mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery .
He did after all have a toy gun .
The mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery is five years .
He won the appeal .
Michael was sentenced to five years in prison .
Judge Forer had to follow the law .
And Michael disappeared .
Now consider Ms. Dewey .
Ms. Dewey &apos;s a teacher in a Texas elementary school .
You need to have incentives .
People have to make a living .
Judge Forer quits , and Ms. Dewey in completely disheartened .
And second , they demoralize the activity itself .
The very practice is demoralized , and the practitioners are demoralized .
And it doesn &apos;t have to be this way .
More hopeful are people we call system-changers .
One in particular is a judge named Robert Russell .
So he started selling marijuana .
He was busted in a drug sweep .
But Judge Russell did have an alternative .
And that &apos;s because he was in a special court .
He was in a court called the Veterans &apos; Court .
Judge Russell created the Veterans &apos; Court .
Why has the idea spread ?
None . None .
The bank was profitable .
The bankers stayed with their loan recipients .
They didn &apos;t make loans and then sell the loans .
They serviced the loans .
We &apos;ll see .
People want to be allowed to be virtuous .
They want to have permission to do the right thing .
Work : engaging in activities that are meaningful and satisfying .
Rules and incentives are no substitutes for wisdom .
Indeed , we argue , there is no substitute for wisdom .
Thanks .
Brian Greene : Making sense of string theory
So where do we go ?
All of that could be described using Newton &apos;s work .
And let me show you what it is that he found .
And that communicates the force of gravity .
Even the Earth warps space around it .
Now look at the Moon .
We go to a full-frame view of this .
That is this new idea about how gravity actually works .
Now , this idea was tested in 1919 through astronomical observations .
It really works . It describes the data .
And this gained Einstein prominence around the world .
And that is what got Kaluza thinking .
That raised a question : warps and curves in what ?
Amazing -- it just popped out .
This is a man who would risk his life on theory .
We don &apos;t seem to see them .
Let me show you that one visually .
And I hope you appreciate this .
It took so long to get these ants to do this .
Let me show you what that would look like .
Until something wonderful happened in our age .
So , let me just tell you how that goes .
Superstring theory -- what is it ?
The idea is like this .
That is where conventional ideas stop .
Here is the new idea of string theory .
Deep inside any of these particles , there is something else .
This something else is this dancing filament of energy .
They don &apos;t produce different musical notes .
The different frequencies produce the different particles .
And that &apos;s what we mean by a unified theory .
Now here is the catch .
Now , does string theory offer an answer ?
Not yet .
This is a deep question .
So can we explain those 20 numbers ?
Let me show you how .
This is what string theory says about the extra dimensions .
They have a very rich , intertwined geometry .
So let me bring some strings into the story .
How would we know it ?
Let me show you that idea visually .
But here &apos;s how the experiment will go .
You take these particles . You slam them together .
Amazing possibility .
Thank you very much .
AJ Jacobs : My year of living biblically
And I like to immerse myself in my topics .
And I see my life as a series of experiments .
So , they answered my emails .
They answered my phone .
It was a wonderful experience .
So , I decided I would try this for a month .
This was the worst month of my life .
I do not recommend this at all .
So , that was hard .
You can just Google it .
So , I wasted some time there .
And I undertook this for two reasons .
So , not very .
But I &apos;ve become increasingly interested in religion .
I had Christian bibles .
I had Jewish bibles .
And this was a very long list -- over 700 rules .
So I wanted to follow those .
My wife wouldn &apos;t kiss me for the last two months .
So , certainly the challenge was there .
You only know if you try it .
I got rid of all my poly-cotton T-shirts .
So , I wanted to follow that rule .
So -- oh , there &apos;s another shot of my beard .
And there were two types of laws that were particularly challenging .
You change your behavior , and you change your mind .
And perhaps the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers .
So , I was able to stone one adulterer .
I wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind .
But he &apos;s still an adulterer , and still quite angry .
How should we view the Bible ?
How was the Bible written ?
And it &apos;s sort of evolved .
The first is , thou shalt not take the Bible literally .
This became very , very clear , early on .
It &apos;s a very relaxing vocation . I recommend it .
So , you know , I met with creationists .
I went to the creationists &apos; museum .
And these are the ultimate literalists .
And they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this .
And I will say , though , the museum is gorgeous .
They really did a fantastic job .
Another lesson is that thou shalt give thanks .
It &apos;s a remarkable thing .
Third , that thou shall have reverence .
And I &apos;m trying to start it as a movement .
The Sabbath can be sacred .
Thou shall not stereotype .
I wanted it to be about religion in America .
Oh , thank you very much .
Thank you . Bless you , bless you .
That &apos;s how they printed them in the old Bibles .
And their argument is that Jesus never talked about homosexuality .
So , this was very inspiring to me .
I recommend Jim Wallis and Tony Campolo .
Also , thou shalt not disregard the irrational .
And I would say , &quot; But that &apos;s crazy . &quot;
And they would say , &quot; Well , what about you ?
You blow out candles on top of a birthday cake .
And finally I learned that thou shall pick and choose .
And I failed miserably .
Because you can &apos;t .
The key is to pick and choose the right parts .
You &apos;re just picking and choosing . &quot;
I &apos;ve had some great meals at cafeterias .
And I thought I &apos;d end with just a couple more .
There &apos;s me reading the Bible .
That &apos;s how I hailed taxicabs .
Kate Stone : DJ decks made of ... paper
And I was also really interested in wireless as well .
I was not at all interested in what he was saying .
I ended up on a farm in the middle of nowhere .
It was in far western New South Wales .
And this farm was 120,000 acres .
doing a Ph.D. in physics .
It really is .
It &apos;s just you do it by changing an environment .
You change its environment , and the object will flow .
Why didn &apos;t you come here in the first place ? &quot;
That &apos;s always the case .
And it &apos;s pretty simple , really .
There &apos;s lots of different things we &apos;ve created .
This is one of them , because I love cake .
But it doesn &apos;t tell you the cake there and then .
Okay .
So this is the bit I &apos;m really scared of .
I &apos;ll just describe how this works .
And it has really good response time .
It &apos;s using Bluetooth 4 , so it &apos;s pretty instantaneous .
Okay . Thanks .
And there &apos;s a couple of other things .
Okay , and this is a D.J. turntable .
Oh , yes . I just love doing that .
So this is my niece , Charlotte .
Yay !
So that &apos;s pretty much what I do .
But it &apos;s not about the technology .
So thank you very much .
Robert Hammond : Building a park in the sky
So they elevated it .
And by 1980 , the last train rode .
And then it was abandoned .
At the time , there was a lot of opposition .
Mayor Giuliani wanted to tear it down .
And it turns out , we got those numbers wrong .
We thought it would cost 100 million dollars to build .
So far it &apos;s cost about 150 million .
That was enough . It really got the city behind it .
It turns out we were wrong on that .
We did a design competition , selected a design team .
There &apos;s three sections .
We opened the fist section in 2009 .
It &apos;s been successful beyond our dreams .
This is one of my favorite features in section one .
It &apos;s this amphitheater right over 10th Ave .
And the first section ends at 20th St. right now .
And this has been designed by Renzo Piano .
And they &apos;re going to break ground in May .
And we &apos;ve already started construction on section two .
This was just installed last month .
Thanks .
Misha Glenny : How global crime networks work
I refer to organized crime .
So what triggered this extraordinary growth in cross-border crime ?
Now it &apos;s time for full disclosure .
This event meant a great deal to me personally .
Obviously there were characters like this .
Like this character . Remember these guys ?
Here are some of those same weightlifters after their 1989 makeover .
That means your police force wasn &apos;t working .
The court system wasn &apos;t functioning properly .
We prefer to know them as the mafia .
But that &apos;s what happened all over Eastern Europe .
But above all else , by talking to the gangsters themselves .
And the Balkans was a fabulous place to start .
And where were they heading ?
It has zones of production , like Afghanistan and Columbia .
It has zones of distribution , like Mexico and the Balkans .
Take Mexico , for example .
But what about the Democratic Republic of Congo ?
Since 1998 , five million people have died there .
Now , cigarettes out the factory gate are very cheap .
This boat is worth one million Euros when it &apos;s new .
And it &apos;s the fastest thing on European waters .
And the answer is six vessels .
It was the liberalization of international financial markets .
for the money launderers .
Bernie Madoff stole 65 billion dollars .
Now , the recession .
Not surprising , the most opportunistic industry in the whole world .
And it has no rules to its regulatory system .
What they &apos;ve done is they &apos;ve shifted their operations .
And it &apos;s been terribly successful .
I would like to introduce you to Mr. Pringle .
Or perhaps I should say , more accurately , Señor Pringle .
It &apos;s really not that difficult .
The key to cybercrime is what we call social engineering .
So , cybercrime , do watch out for it .
And these pills contain only low doses of the active ingredient .
Which is why the parasite is beginning to develop a resistance .
They affect our bank accounts .
They affect our communications , our pension funds .
They even affect the food that we eat and our governments .
There is no romance involved with gangsters in the 21st Century .
It &apos;s been a privilege talking to you .
Thank you very much .
Larry Burns : The future of cars
People love their automobiles .
Songs are written about cars .
Prince wrote a great song : &quot; Little Red Corvette . &quot;
He wrote about a car .
And 750 million people in the world today own a car .
And you say , boy , that &apos;s a lot .
But you know what ?
That &apos;s just 12 percent of the population .
We wanted something that was really affordable .
First was Autonomy .
Autonomy really set the vision for where we wanted to head .
And Sequel truly is a real car .
So let me talk about hydrogen first .
And it can come from biofuels .
And that &apos;s quite exciting .
A lot of hydrogen &apos;s produced today in the world .
Now that &apos;s a lot of money .
So we &apos;re pretty excited about the future of hydrogen .
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re driving to for 2010 .
We actually think the future &apos;s going to be event-driven .
that &apos;s a huge power-generating capability , a mobile power-generating capability .
And we talked about swarm networks earlier .
We find that premise quite exciting .
Thank you very much .
.
I just want to ask one .
Larry Burns : Yeah , we &apos;re absolutely serious .
And secondly , it &apos;s a fundamental business proposition .
We can &apos;t grow our business unless we solve these problems .
If we can see this possible future , others can too .
Drew Berry : Animations of unseeable biology
Now molecules are really , really tiny .
And by tiny , I mean really .
One way around this is to draw pictures .
And this idea is actually nothing new .
And he transformed our understanding of the Moon .
So this is a transection through blood .
And those red molecules are hemoglobin .
What would it look like ?
This is DNA in its classic double helix form .
This was work from a number of years ago .
Thank you .
So again , we begin with DNA .
It &apos;s packaged up and bundled up .
All this field of view is a single strand of DNA .
This huge package of DNA is called a chromosome .
And we &apos;ll come back to chromosomes in a minute .
No , I &apos;m being told , &quot; No . &quot;
The nuclear envelope breaks down .
And then the cell splits down the middle .
So again , here we are at that equator moment .
The chromosomes line up .
So this is a single chromosome .
And you have two strands of DNA in each chromosome .
One is bundled up into one sausage .
The other strand is bundled up into the other sausage .
They &apos;re called mircrotubules . That name &apos;s not important .
It is obviously central to the movement of the chromosomes .
It is a signal broadcasting system .
It is able to couple onto the growing and shrinking microtubules .
It &apos;s also an attention sensing system .
And it &apos;s walked away down the microtubules .
That is the signal broadcasting system sending out the stop signal .
It &apos;s molecular clockwork .
This is how you work at the molecular scale .
They &apos;re little molecular courier molecules walking one way .
So again , this is all derived accurately from the science .
Thank you .
Mechai Viravaidya : How Mr. Condom made Thailand a better place
Welcome to Thailand .
Not just child mortality alone , you need also family planning .
In my country , that was the case in 1974 .
Seven children per family -- tremendous growth at 3.3 percent .
There was just no future .
We needed to reduce the population growth rate .
So we said , &quot; Let &apos;s do it . &quot;
No , we decided to do a bit more .
So we went to the ordinary people that you saw .
We were so much bigger than Coca-Cola in those days .
And this picture was sent throughout the country .
It &apos;s been blessed . &quot;
That was their perception .
And then we went to teachers .
So we went to the teachers .
If you land on anything pro-family planning , you move ahead .
Like , &quot; Mother takes the pill every night .
Very good , mother . Move ahead .
Again , education , class entertainment .
And the kids were doing it in school too .
If you &apos;re pregnant , take care of your pregnancy .
And that was run by them .
And this is on the Fourth of July .
Of course , it must be American cola .
You get two brands , Coke and Pepsi .
And then the food is either hamburger or hotdog . &quot;
And I thought a hotdog will be more symbolic .
And what happened ?
And so that &apos;s the case of everyone joining in .
So our work wasn &apos;t affected .
And that &apos;s when we went onto the airwaves .
And then we got a new prime minister soon after that .
He asked me in because he liked my wife a lot .
So I said , &quot; Okay . &quot;
So they were happy with that .
And then AIDS education in all schools , starting from university .
And these are high school kids teaching high school kids .
And then we went down one more step .
And we said , &quot; Everyone needs to be involved . &quot;
So they all trained .
And they loved him . You need a symbol of something .
In taxis , you get condoms .
So , can you imagine New York policemen giving out condoms ?
And these were the condoms that we introduced .
One says , &quot; Weapon of mass protection . &quot;
But I have some to give out afterward .
Stop global warming ; use condoms .
And let the next Olympics save some lives .
Why just run around ?
And then what happened ?
After all this time , everybody joined in .
Otherwise there wouldn &apos;t be many Thais walking around today .
90 percent of the funding came from Thailand .
We all need to help .
Those are the things to be provided by the business community .
The only way out of poverty is through business enterprise .
So , that was done .
The money goes from the company into the village via tree-planting .
It &apos;s not a free gift .
Access to credit must be a human right .
Otherwise they &apos;ll never get out of poverty .
And then before getting a loan , you must be trained .
They said , &quot; They should stop making shoes and clothes .
Make these better , because we can afford them . &quot;
And then we have silk , Thai silk .
That &apos;s the difference .
You can order your condoms with your with your cappuccino .
We call this our School-Based Integrated Rural Development .
Re-do the school , make it serve the community needs .
This is a geodesic dome made of bamboo .
So we have now found the weapon of mass protection .
And then , finally , that is our network .
And these are our Thai tulips .
Thank you very much indeed .
Krista Tippett : Reconnecting with compassion
We &apos;re here to celebrate compassion .
But compassion , from my vantage point , has a problem .
Our cultural imagination about compassion has been deadened by idealistic images .
And the going is pretty rough right now .
Compassion is a worthy successor .
So what is it , three-dimensionally ?
What are its kindred and component parts ?
What &apos;s in its universe of attendant virtues ?
But kindness is an everyday byproduct of all the great virtues .
And it is a most edifying form of instant gratification .
Compassion is also curious .
Compassion cultivates and practices curiosity .
Well that &apos;s going to be a breeding ground for compassion .
Compassion can be synonymous with empathy .
And compassion does seek physicality .
I first started to learn this most vividly from Matthew Sanford .
Compassion also looks like this .
This is Jean Vanier .
And compassion can also have those qualities .
It lodged as shards inside every aspect of the Creation .
Now this might sound like a fanciful tale .
Some of my fellow journalists might interpret it that way .
Einstein believed deeply that science should transcend national and ethnic divisions .
He liked to talk about the spiritual geniuses of the ages .
Well , he was complicated .
Gandhi , too , was a real flawed human being .
So was Mother Teresa .
So are we all .
Our culture is obsessed with perfection and with hiding problems .
Thank you .
David Carson : Design and discovery
It &apos;s a thought . Just a thought .
And there &apos;s something nice about slides getting stuck .
With that , let &apos;s get the first slide up here .
I mean , how nice is that ?
You know , it &apos;s pretty clear .
O.K. , which one would you park in front of ?
Same color , same message , same words .
I would probably park in front of the other one .
This is for a book by &quot; Metropolis . &quot;
This is from my second book .
People are just going to take pictures now .
And of course , that wasn &apos;t the case .
It &apos;s something everybody has .
So it tends to get discounted .
I like this for a couple of reasons .
&quot; Don &apos;t mistake legibility for communication . &quot;
Just because something &apos;s legible doesn &apos;t means it communicates .
And I think that &apos;s sometimes an overlooked area .
This is working with Marshall McLuhan .
So , this was the contents page originally .
I hate this stuff . It &apos;s hard to read .
So , this is a project for Nine Inch Nails .
I was , O.K. ; that &apos;s fine .
And I thought , you know , what were they thinking ?
You &apos;d think maybe cement , possibly , or something .
So , this is a six-shot sequence .
They were wild-posted around New York City .
And it was purposely done to look fairly serious .
I felt this was one of the more successful solutions .
I did some work for Microsoft a few years back .
It was a worldwide branding campaign .
They thought some people didn &apos;t like them .
And this is how the ad ran around the world .
Now , there &apos;s kind of two issues here .
This is some work from Ray Gun .
And this continued through the entire magazine .
It did not let up .
This says : &quot; One clean fits all . &quot; .
This was what they found on their car .
This is my desktop .
We are wrapping up .
I &apos;m just not sure this is improvement .
You have to utilize who you are in your work .
This lady &apos;s advertising for her lost pit bull .
That &apos;s pretty high for most occupations .
Some of them did ; some of them didn &apos;t .
And for the most part , they &apos;re not real life-threatening .
Why not experiment ? Why not have some fun ?
Why not put some of yourself into the work ?
And if you would , you &apos;ve got a great job .
You &apos;re going to be dead a really long time .
Thank you very much .
Jaime Lerner : A song of the city
I hope you &apos;ll understand my English .
But we have a very pessimistic approach about the cities .
So , the other character is Otto , the automobile .
Freeways .
He &apos;s a very demanding person .
Speaking about the design : every city has its own design .
Curitiba , Rio : it &apos;s like two birds kissing themselves .
And every city has its own design .
And that &apos;s the structure of the city of Curitiba .
And it &apos;s an example of living and working together .
And it took 25 years until another city ...
which is Bogota , and they did a very good job .
And this is an articulated bus , double-articulated .
And we are very close to my house .
And that &apos;s the evolution of the system .
It &apos;s not enough , a new materials .
It &apos;s not enough , new sources of energy .
I &apos;ll speak on this later on .
The subway was against , of course .
And after , the children teach their parents .
Seven zero .
So teach the children .
You should have always a structure of living and working together .
Another issue is , a city &apos;s like our family portrait .
And these are the references that we have in any city .
And these are the references from our ethnic contribution .
All of a sudden , the Soviet Union , they split .
If you cut two zeros , it &apos;s much better .
Parks -- old quarries that they were transformed into parks .
So , in a city , you have to work fast .
Planning takes time . And I &apos;m proposing urban acupuncture .
And I think creativity , innovation is starting .
And we cannot have all the answers .
OK ?
Please , allow me just two minutes .
You &apos;re going to make the music and the rhythm .
Brené Brown : The power of vulnerability
And I was like , &quot; Why not magic pixie ? &quot;
I tried to call deep on my courage .
And I thought , you know , I am a storyteller .
I &apos;m a qualitative researcher .
I collect stories ; that &apos;s what I do .
And maybe stories are just data with a soul .
And maybe I &apos;m just a storyteller .
And so I said , &quot; You know what ?
Why don &apos;t you just say I &apos;m a researcher-storyteller . &quot;
And this is where my story starts .
And I thought he was just sweet-talking me .
That was my mantra .
So I was very excited about this .
But I want to be able to make them not messy .
I want to understand them .
So where I started was with connection .
It &apos;s what gives purpose and meaning to our lives .
This is what it &apos;s all about .
And it turned out to be shame .
So I was ready , and I was really excited .
You know this .
And I kind of got a handle on it .
That &apos;s it .
They believe they &apos;re worthy .
What do these people have in common ?
And the first words that came to my mind were whole-hearted .
What &apos;s the theme ? What &apos;s the pattern ?
And so here &apos;s what I found .
What they had in common was a sense of courage .
They believed that what made them vulnerable made them beautiful .
They just talked about it being necessary .
They thought this was fundamental .
I personally thought it was betrayal .
And it did .
Do you have any recommendations ? &quot;
I was like , &quot; What does that mean ? &quot;
Don &apos;t bring your measuring stick . &quot;
I was like , &quot; Okay . &quot;
So I found a therapist .
And she said , &quot; How are you ? &quot;
She said , &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
And she said , &quot; What &apos;s the struggle ? &quot;
&quot; I just need some strategies . &quot;
Thank you .
So she goes like this .
&quot; It just is what it is . &quot;
And it did , and it didn &apos;t .
And it took about a year .
For me , it was a yearlong street fight .
It was a slugfest .
Vulnerability pushed , I pushed back .
I lost the fight , but probably won my life back .
Why do we struggle with it so much ?
Am I alone in struggling with vulnerability ?
No .
So this is what I learned .
We numb vulnerability -- when we &apos;re waiting for the call .
What makes you feel vulnerable ? &quot;
Because I wanted to know what &apos;s out there .
We live in a vulnerable world .
You can &apos;t say , here &apos;s the bad stuff .
I don &apos;t want to feel these .
I don &apos;t want to feel these .
And I know that &apos;s knowing laughter .
I hack into your lives for a living .
God .
You cannot selectively numb .
And it becomes this dangerous cycle .
And it doesn &apos;t just have to be addiction .
I &apos;m right , you &apos;re wrong . Shut up .
That &apos;s it .
Just certain .
This is what politics looks like today .
There &apos;s no discourse anymore .
There &apos;s no conversation .
There &apos;s just blame .
You know how blame is described in the research ?
A way to discharge pain and discomfort .
We perfect .
And we perfect , most dangerously , our children .
Let me tell you what we think about children .
They &apos;re hardwired for struggle when they get here .
That &apos;s not our job .
That &apos;s our job .
We do that in our personal lives .
We &apos;ll fix it . &quot;
Can I believe in this this passionately ?
Can I be this fierce about this ? &quot;
That &apos;s all I have . Thank you .
Jinsop Lee : Design for all 5 senses
If you &apos;re laughing , you know what I mean .
Here &apos;s my clock .
However , here &apos;s Chris &apos; clock .
In each shot glass is a different scented oil .
You can see why I hate Chris .
This problem &apos;s been bugging me for well over a decade .
And when she said this , I had an epiphany .
Here &apos;s a quick video to show you how it works .
So here are some other results .
The first is for instant noodles .
You know .
Needless to say , I no longer dine with these people .
Okay , next , clubbing .
These people I still do hang out with .
All right , and smoking .
That is , of course , sex . Great sex .
Here &apos;s Chris &apos; clock .
And that &apos;s what this theory taught me about my field .
Here &apos;s three quick ideas I came up with .
We could call this &quot; the perfumator . &quot;
All right , next .
There &apos;s also the six emotions and that elusive x-factor .
Maybe that could be the topic of my next talk .
Oh , one last thing before I leave .
And the best way to do that is with free candy .
You guys ready ?
All right .
He was the most respected scientist in the field .
Not a trivial matter .
You don &apos;t see it in the newspaper every day .
But there are 35 to 40,000 different varieties of beans .
And I want to give you an example of that .
It &apos;s a bit of a personal example , in fact .
Imagine that . 7,100 apples with names .
They gave them their name .
The bad news is they &apos;re extinct .
This book was published in 1904 .
See , we used to have a lot of apples .
And then he has to go even further .
And there are a couple of answers to that question .
And for that reason , we ought to be saving it .
Think of diversity as giving us options .
Is agriculture adapted to that ?
I don &apos;t know . Can fish play the piano ?
Here &apos;s South Africa . The same story .
We will watch children starve to death on TV .
It &apos;s two breeding cycles for maize .
We have two rolls of the dice to get this right .
Now , the good news is that we have conserved .
In Rwanda , in the Solomon Islands .
To Svalbard , in fact .
This is above mainland Norway . You can see Greenland there .
That &apos;s at 78 degrees north .
It &apos;s otherworldly , beautiful .
And this next picture shows it in context , in Svalbard .
And here &apos;s the front door of this facility .
I think of it as sort of a cathedral .
Some of the happiest days of my life have been spent ...
in this place there .
We have now about 425,000 samples of unique crop varieties .
This is a backup system for world agriculture .
It operates like a safety deposit box .
Agriculture takes 70 percent of fresh water supplies on earth .
So , this is not something pretty and nice to do .
It is , I agree , a nice thing to do .
But it &apos;s a necessary thing to do .
We need to collect the remaining diversity that &apos;s out there .
And we need to support it financially .
Thank you .
Amos Winter : The cheap all-terrain wheelchair
If you &apos;re crossing the street , you have sidewalk cutouts .
But in the developing world , things are quite different .
Why not in countries like the U.S. too ?
The road was too rough .
Ashok : You also encouraged me to work .
I rested for a day at home .
The next day I went to my shop .
Now everything is back to normal .
Stephen Friend : The hunt for &quot; unexpected genetic heroes &quot;
That moment changed my life .
the answer is not really .
And there are two commonly given reasons for why that happens .
One of them is it &apos;s early days .
We don &apos;t know how to read the sentences .
We don &apos;t know how to follow the narrative .
Maybe we should be studying those that are well .
They &apos;re not going to help us .
That &apos;s not what we &apos;re looking for .
What &apos;s your evidence that this could be feasible ? &quot;
I want to give you two examples .
The first comes from San Francisco .
They went on to get AIDS .
They didn &apos;t get AIDS .
Where are we going to look ?
Well , we could look locally . That makes sense .
And let &apos;s look at a million individuals .
They started saying , &quot; This is interesting .
I would be glad to join your effort .
I would be willing to participate . &quot;
They didn &apos;t say , &quot; Where is my authorship ? &quot;
We asked Leif up in Finland .
We found dozens of these strong candidate unexpected heroes .
Basically all we need is information .
I &apos;m willing to be re-contacted . &quot;
What are our genes ? &quot;
Thank you very much .
Lesley Hazleton : The doubt essential to faith
Writing biography is a strange thing to do .
Yet the question wouldn &apos;t let go of me .
Still , some boundaries are larger than others .
He did not run down shouting , &quot; Hallelujah ! &quot;
and &quot; Bless the Lord ! &quot;
He did not radiate light and joy .
Quite the contrary .
He was overwhelmed not with conviction , but by doubt .
Fear was the only sane response , the only human response .
Demanding perfection , they refuse to tolerate human imperfection .
Yet what , exactly , is imperfect about doubt ?
In effect , they are the infidels .
This isn &apos;t faith .
We have to recognize that real faith has no easy answers .
It &apos;s difficult and stubborn .
I &apos;m not convinced of this .
I can hardly say I believe it .
Because despair is self-fulfilling .
And I , for one , refuse to live that way .
We insist on faith in the future and in each other .
Call this naive if you like .
Call it impossibly idealistic if you must .
But one thing is sure : Call it human .
I think not .
He &apos;d be torn apart by the bitter divisiveness of sectarianism .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Motor racing is a funny old business .
And then the next year , we start again .
So there &apos;s about 25,000 things there that can go wrong .
So motor racing is very much about attention to detail .
We &apos;re always trying to make it faster .
So how do we do that ?
Well , we start our life with the racing car .
It &apos;s measuring all sorts of things around the car .
It &apos;s a huge amount of data .
You need to be able to do something with it .
Let &apos;s pick a bit of data from another three-month-old patient .
It was deemed to be an unpredictable event .
This was a heart attack that no one could see coming .
So the question is , why couldn &apos;t we see it ?
Was this a predictable event ?
It &apos;s a patient with a heart problem .
And then we started looking at the data .
It &apos;s telling us that something is going wrong .
The green is us learning what is normal for that child .
We call it the cloud of normality .
There &apos;s no rocket science here .
So we have a very ambitious program .
We think that the race is on to do something differently .
It can go beyond the walls .
Thank you very much .
James Randi : Homeopathy , quackery and fraud
Good morning .
Now , how do we go about that sort of thing ?
It &apos;s a beard trimmer , you see ?
You believe I &apos;m looking at you .
These are not glasses , these are empty frames .
Quite empty frames .
Don &apos;t you ever forget that .
But I &apos;m going to take some medication .
This is a full bottle of Calms Forte .
I &apos;ll explain that in just a moment .
I will take enough of these . Mm .
Indeed , the whole container .
Thirty-two tablets of Calms Forte .
I &apos;m an actor who plays a specific part .
Oh , they gladly sell you that , yes .
You might agree with me on that .
I wonder if that &apos;s true .
Good bye . &quot;
And she didn &apos;t answer the damn question !
Where is the will ?
She doesn &apos;t bring any useful information to us .
Is this a hunting game ?
Hunting and fishing ? What is it ?
Now , this is a process that is called cold reading .
Folks , that &apos;s what dying is all about !
You stop breathing , and then you &apos;re dead .
It &apos;s that simple .
I don &apos;t think so .
It was a game of hunting questions like this .
This is what they go through .
Isn &apos;t it just a lot of fun ? &quot;
Now , Sylvia Browne is the big operator .
We call her &quot; The Talons . &quot;
That &apos;s her , you can tell right away .
Now , Montel Williams is an intelligent man .
We all know who he is on television .
He just doesn &apos;t care .
Now , without that , how could we possibly function ?
Duh .
And the men were all Grecian warriors fighting with Agamemnon .
He isn &apos;t worth bringing back , obviously .
Everyone comes back from heaven , but never from hell .
Very simply won .
It &apos;s very easy , win the million dollars .
And we haven &apos;t heard from her since . Strange .
Duh .
I &apos;m alive , you may have noticed .
Well , pretty well anyway .
Now these people need to be stopped , seriously now .
They need to be stopped because this is a cruel farce .
We get people coming to the foundation all the time .
Now , I popped some pills earlier .
I have to explain that to you .
Homeopathy , let &apos;s find out what that &apos;s all about .
Hmm . You &apos;ve heard of it .
It &apos;s an alternative form of healing , right ?
Homeopathy actually consists -- and that &apos;s what this is .
Keep your seats -- it &apos;s going to be okay .
Why don &apos;t they affect me ?
The answer may surprise you .
What is homeopathy ?
The poor man , he was on homeopathic medicine .
He died of an overdose .
He forgot to take his pill .
Work on it . Work on it .
It &apos;s a ridiculous thing . It is absolutely ridiculous .
They might , some place out there .
Maybe these people are just independently wealthy .
Well , with Sylvia Browne I would think so .
I mean that &apos;s a fabulous amount of money .
I think that something needs to be done about this .
If you find out -- now I understand .
Those are very important , critically important to us .
And we must do something about those problems .
It &apos;s the bottom line , the dollar line .
That &apos;s what they &apos;re looking at .
We really must do something about this .
It &apos;s www.randi.org.
You will see the records that we have .
She did accept and then backed away .
Thank you .
Marc Koska : 1.3m reasons to re-invent the syringe
And hence they ended up in an orphanage .
They started with two and they ended with two .
So you can imagine the scale of this problem .
These kids in Pakistan don &apos;t go to school .
They are lucky . They already have a job .
In China , recycling is a major issue .
So recycling and reuse are the major issues here .
But there was one interesting anecdote that I found in Indonesia .
And they are having great fun .
And they squirt the water into their mouths .
And these are used with traces of blood visible .
So , it &apos;s a normal-looking syringe .
You give the injection and then put it down .
It &apos;s very , very simple . Thank you .
And it costs the same as a normal syringe .
And in comparison , a Coca-Cola is 10 times the price .
And that will stop reusing a syringe 20 or 30 times .
Thank you very much .
Deb Roy : The birth of a word
This is my wife and collaborator , Rupal .
Okay .
DR : He sure nailed it , didn &apos;t he .
So he didn &apos;t just learn water .
He was an early talker .
And so we started to analyze why .
Why were certain words born before others ?
And the &#91; horizontal &#93; axis is time .
And we would plot the relative length of the utterances .
But that &apos;s looking at the speech context .
What about the visual context ?
So welcome to my home .
This is a moment , one moment captured across multiple cameras .
That &apos;s me and my son on the floor .
And there &apos;s video analytics that are tracking our movements .
The spiral thread we call a &quot; solo hot spot . &quot;
And we think that these affect the way language is learned .
So here &apos;s how we &apos;re approaching this .
He &apos;s leaving red ink behind .
And there &apos;s our nanny by the door .
Nanny : You want water ?
Nanny : All right .
And what this data leaves in its wake is a landscape .
We call these wordscapes .
That &apos;s where those big peaks are over to the left .
And so our effort took an unexpected turn .
And the same idea now can be built up .
And then the important third dimension .
And there are fascinating dynamics at play .
It &apos;s not one way .
They talk to other people .
We &apos;ve given this person a name .
And he was quiet for a moment .
And I thought , &quot; What am I thinking ?
It &apos;s a cluttered environment ; it &apos;s natural life .
Listen very carefully .
DR : Hey .
Come here .
Can you do it ?
Oh , boy .
Can you do it ?
Baby : Yeah .
DR : Ma , he &apos;s walking .
DR : Thank you .
Jill Sobule + Julia Sweeney : The Jill and Julia Show
Founding fathers all had slaves . Sweeney : I know .
The explorers slaughtered the braves . Sweeney : Horribly .
Do you guys know about that movie &quot; The Secret &quot; ?
That movie is so horrible . It promotes such awful pseudoscience .
So that &apos;s what I have to say .
John Wooden : The difference between winning and succeeding
So I wanted to come up with something of my own .
&apos;I failed ! &apos; He cried .
That made an impression on me in the 1930s .
I love poetry and always had an interest in that somehow .
I knew him once , but then he was a boy .
One was -- never be late . Never be late .
I believe in time -- very important .
And I tell them , &quot; Don &apos;t run practices late .
Because you &apos;ll go home in a bad mood .
And the third one was , never criticize a teammate .
Not like the coaches today , for gracious sakes , no .
It &apos;s a little different than it was in my day .
And those actually came from my dad .
And right at the top -- faith and patience .
And they are . They want to change everything .
They think all change is progress .
And we forget there is no progress without change .
So you must have patience .
And I believe that we must have faith .
But it all revolved around that original definition of success .
He spelled Moriarty with only one &apos; i &apos; .
I &apos;d never seen that before , but he did .
And no one can do more than that .
And you can win when you &apos;re outscored .
But there &apos;s getting there that &apos;s the fun .
But I &apos;d want one that could play , too .
But I &apos;d want one that would play offense too .
And I &apos;d want one that could pass and would pass .
I wanted them to be able to shoot from the outside .
I wanted them to be good inside too .
Neither one of those youngsters could shoot very well .
Somebody else is in there ahead of them .
And so they played pretty good defense for us .
Have I rambled enough ?
Wade Davis : Gorgeous photos of a backyard wilderness worth saving
This is actually a story of my own backyard .
In two four-month seasons I saw not a dozen people .
There was no one to relate publicly to .
For them , the Headwaters is a kitchen .
The Tahltan need your help . We need your help .
Thank you very much .
Andy Puddicombe : All it takes is 10 mindful minutes
We live in an incredibly busy world .
Just 10 minutes , undisturbed ?
And when I say nothing , I do mean nothing .
Simply doing nothing .
I see a lot of very blank faces .
And this is an extraordinary thing , right ?
We &apos;re talking about our mind .
The result , of course , is that we get stressed .
That &apos;s really not how it has to be .
You get stressed , you do some meditation .
It was a really very stressful time .
I guess we all deal with stress in different ways .
Some people hit the bottle , start taking medication .
People often ask me what I learned from that time .
Well , obviously it changed things .
But it was more than that .
I think the present moment is so underrated .
Forty-seven percent .
But we need to know how to do it .
That &apos;s essentially what meditation is .
It &apos;s familiarizing ourselves with the present moment .
Let &apos;s say this is an anxious thought .
But what do you do every 20 , 30 seconds ?
It does hurt . And we reinforce the storyline , right ?
That &apos;s the potential of meditation , of mindfulness .
Thank you very much .
Krista Donaldson : The $ 80 prosthetic knee that &apos;s changing lives
How do you ensure technology reaches users ?
And D-Rev is short for Design Revolution .
And how big a problem is this ?
And what are their options ?
It &apos;s got a microprocessor inside .
This is a low-end titanium knee .
And lastly , here you see a low-end knee .
And while you have affordability , you &apos;ve lost on functionality .
So you can think about how unstable that would be .
And he &apos;s doing a 10-meter walk test .
Now this is a video of Kamal .
You remember Kamal earlier , holding the bamboo staff .
And you can see his stability is much better .
So world class isn &apos;t just about technical performance .
It &apos;s also about human performance .
We see that they squat . They kneel in prayer .
What is the local market like ?
How do all these components get to the clinic ?
Do they all get there on time ? The supply chain .
Notice anything about it ?
It clicks .
We &apos;d seen that users had actually modified it .
So do you see that black strip right there ?
That &apos;s a homemade noise dampener .
He &apos;d made a cosmesis .
The other thing we did is that we smoothed the profile .
We made it thinner .
And this goes into my last point .
They &apos;re not donated . They &apos;re not heavily subsidized .
It also has to be designed to be very affordable .
The industry average is about 65 percent .
Right now , our knees are worn in 12 countries .
So I want to end with a story of Pournima .
So thank you .
Marisa Fick-Jordan : The wonder of Zulu wire art
This is our group , our main group of weavers .
They come on a weekly basis to Durban .
They all have bank accounts .
It &apos;s a weekly turnaround of production .
And the rest says it all .
Thank you very much .
Sherwin Nuland : The extraordinary power of ordinary people
What have I heard during these last four days ?
This is my third visit to TED .
And this gives me enormous hope .
Well , it reminds me a little bit of surgery .
And that &apos;s the way it is with definitions of words .
And you know what I found out ?
There are different paradigms .
He said , &quot; I think so . &quot;
&quot; The world will not be saved by the Internet . &quot;
We feel it at concerts .
It is an elevation of us beyond ourselves .
Well , you know precisely what it is .
So , here we are .
I would like to quote one of my own household gods .
And I &apos;ll read you what it is .
Thank you very much .
Margaret Gould Stewart : How YouTube thinks about copyright
And that &apos;s over 20 hours of video every minute .
Now , what do we do when we find a match ?
Remember Chris Brown &apos;s video &quot; Forever &quot; ?
This is their wedding video .
You may have seen it .
I mean , who are these people ?
I totally want to go to that wedding .
So Sony is generating revenue from both of these .
By empowering choice , we can create a culture of opportunity .
So why has no one ever solved this problem before ?
There &apos;s musical labels .
There &apos;s multiple music publishers .
And each of these can vary by country .
So we have to manage many claims to the same video .
YouTube &apos;s Content ID system addresses all of these cases .
But the system only works through the participation of rights owners .
But it &apos;s not just about dollars and impressions .
Thank you .
Roselinde Torres : What it takes to be a great leader
What makes a great leader today ?
The odds are , probably not .
Now , these recurring stories cause me to ask two questions .
I want to share some of those with you now .
The answer to this question is on your calendar .
Who are you spending time with ? On what topics ?
Where are you traveling ? What are you reading ?
Great leaders are not head-down .
There &apos;s an expression : Go along to get along .
Great leaders dare to be different .
And it &apos;s a leap , not a step .
So what makes a great leader in the 21st century ?
I &apos;ve met many , and they stand out .
Thank you .
Mike deGruy : Hooked by an octopus
I first became fascinated with octopus at an early age .
But the octopus did .
Then he lifts another arm and I lift an arm .
Then he lifts another arm and I lift another arm .
He said , &quot; Make a movie about this expedition . &quot;
Maybe I can do this all the time .
Yeah , I &apos;ll be a filmmaker . &quot;
It &apos;s been a good ride .
And what I learned in school though was really beneficial .
As a matter of fact , there &apos;s one right there .
And after the first week , they ignored us .
And I always wondered what happened under that web .
It was fantastic .
And octopus are , they live in all the oceans .
They also live deep .
It &apos;s like nothing you &apos;ve ever done .
And it gets quiet .
And it starts getting really nice .
And now you &apos;ve entered the realm of the mid-water community .
And this vent fluid is about 600 or 700 degrees F.
The surrounding water is just a couple of degrees above freezing .
And it completely threw science on its head .
There &apos;s no hot water .
But 10 miles down the ridge ...
pshhh ! There &apos;s another volcano going .
Ah ! I know where I can shoot that .
And you show up , and it &apos;s dead .
You think , &quot; Well , what happened ? &quot;
And over here there &apos;s a golf course going in .
And this is the tropics .
It &apos;s raining like crazy here .
But , encouragingly , I &apos;ve seen just the opposite .
Well , how it happened is the local community galvanized .
I think Margaret Mead said it best .
Indeed , it &apos;s the only thing that ever has .
And a small group of thoughtful people changed that bay .
I &apos;m a big fan of grassroots organizations .
I &apos;m an individual . I &apos;m one person .
Fair enough question .
Look in your own backyard .
Look in your heart , actually .
And fix it .
So that &apos;s how I answer that question .
And do that , and spread the word .
In theory , we &apos;re thinking , rational human beings .
And I applaud that . I loudly applaud that .
And that I do .
Thank you very much .
Andy Hobsbawm : Do the green thing
Great creativity can make politicians electable , or parties unelectable .
It can make war seem like tragedy or farce .
This is a time of need .
Our climate is changing quickly , too quickly .
To tempt us to act differently with delightful creative scraps .
Strange and wonderful things he would not otherwise have seen .
A deer with an itchy leg . A flying motorcycle .
Sure , she had aged a little .
In fact , she had aged a lot .
But he felt all his old passion for her return .
The earth moved for both of them .
And they lived together happily ever after .
And all because he decided to walk that day .
The moral imperative is on the table .
Let &apos;s get creative against climate change .
And let &apos;s do it soon . Thank you .
Sting : How I started writing songs again
I &apos;d watch those same men walking back home every night .
I was fairly determined that it wouldn &apos;t be .
So far , so good , right ?
So you start asking yourself questions .
Or perhaps there &apos;s a more -- a deeper psychological reason .
It was always a Faustian pact anyway .
Well they say , write what you know .
This is Jackie White .
He &apos;s the foreman of the shipyard .
I &apos;m not very happy with her .
Inside the Rolls-Royce is the Queen Mother .
This is a big deal .
I see her , and she seems to see me .
She acknowledges me . She waves , and she smiles .
And I wave my flag even more vigorously .
We &apos;re having a moment , me and the Queen Mother .
She &apos;s acknowledged me .
And then she &apos;s gone .
Well , I wasn &apos;t cured of anything .
It was the opposite , actually .
I was infected .
I was infected with an idea .
I don &apos;t belong in this street .
I don &apos;t want to live in that house .
I don &apos;t want to end up in that shipyard .
I want to be in that car .
I want a bigger life .
I want a life beyond this town .
I want a life that &apos;s out of the ordinary .
It &apos;s my right .
It &apos;s my right as much as hers .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Okay , you have to join in if you know it .
It &apos;s very easy . Sing in unison .
Here we go .
Sending out an S.O.S. Come on now .
Hawa Abdi + Deqo Mohamed : Mother and daughter doctor-heroes
So there was no job , no food .
So our patients are women and children .
And they are in our backyard .
It &apos;s our home . We welcome them .
There is no government to protect them .
It is very tough .
That &apos;s their house .
Would you explain the rules for admission ?
We are sharing with them whatever we have .
But there are only two rules .
&#91; Whomever &#93; makes those things we throw out .
The second : no man can beat his wife .
Until they identify this case , we &apos;ll never release him .
That &apos;s our two rules .
We can reconcile .
We can do everything .
So we came up with these two rules .
PM : You &apos;re running a medical clinic .
You &apos;re also running a civil society .
I admired them , and I decided to become a doctor .
That &apos;s why I became a doctor .
So Dr. Deqo has to explain .
Maybe I should become an historian , or maybe a reporter .
I loved it , but it didn &apos;t work .
My sister was different .
She &apos;s here . She &apos;s also a doctor .
She graduated in Russia also .
Most people fled abroad .
I succeeded in my place .
And I &apos;m thankful for my daughters .
They do everything for them .
They have done what I desire to do for them .
She &apos;s very tough ; it &apos;s most challenging .
She always expects us to do more .
That &apos;s the best part .
PM : But you do it for good reasons .
Wait . Wait .
H Thank you .
Thank you .
H Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
Eduardo Paes : The 4 commandments of cities
It &apos;s a great honor to be here .
It &apos;s great to be here as a mayor .
That &apos;s the place to be .
Actually it was a very hard challenge .
We had to beat the European monarchy .
This is Juan Carlos , king of Spain .
So it was not easy at all .
We really showed that , yes , we can .
And really , this is the reason I came here tonight .
It &apos;s a difficult task to deal with cities .
I want you all to imagine Rio .
Bird : This is incredible .
We &apos;re like every big city in the world .
It &apos;s like the heart of the suburb in Rio .
The temperature &apos;s going to drop two , three degrees centigrade .
You &apos;ve got to think green and green .
cities are packed with people .
So how do you move these people around ?
But there is a problem .
High-capacity transportation means spending lots and lots of money .
It &apos;s the BRT , the Bus Rapid Transit .
You transform it inside as a train car .
You use separate lanes , dedicated lanes .
The contractors , they don &apos;t like that .
You don &apos;t have to dig deep down underground .
You can build nice stations .
This is actually a station that we &apos;re doing in Rio .
A kilometer of this costs a tenth of a subway .
This is a map of Rio .
You can find original ways to get things done .
Moving to the third commandment .
And this is the most controversial one .
Let me just show a map of Rio again .
All these red parts are favelas .
So you see , they are spread all over the city .
This is a typical view of a favela in Rio .
You see the contrast between the rich and poor .
So I want to make two points here tonight about favelas .
I &apos;m going to give a fast example here .
We call it a family clinic .
We even built a theater there -- 3D movie .
Between November and May , Rio &apos;s completely packed .
We just had last week Carnivale .
It was great . It was lots of fun .
We have New Year &apos;s Eve .
There &apos;s like two million people on Copacabana Beach .
We have problems .
We have problems with the tropical rains .
Almost every year we have these landslides , which are terrible .
But the reason I could come here is because of that .
It &apos;s what we call the Operations Center of Rio .
We &apos;re going to speak now to the Operations Center .
This is Osorio , he &apos;s our secretary of urban affairs .
So Osorio , good to be there with you .
So how &apos;s the weather in Rio now ?
Let me get you our weather satellite radar .
You see just a little bit of moisture around the city .
EP : Okay , how &apos;s the traffic ?
Osario : Well traffic tonight is fine .
Let me get you one of our 8,000 buses .
A live transmission in downtown Rio for you , Mr. Mayor .
You see , the streets are clear .
Now it &apos;s 11 : 00 pm in Rio .
Nothing of concern in terms of traffic .
I &apos;ll get to you now the incidents of the day .
These are the cars .
Osorio : Absolutely , Mr. Mayor .
Let me get you the fleet of our waste collection trucks .
This is live transmission .
We have GPS &apos;s in all of our trucks .
Waste collection on time .
Public services working well .
EP : Okay , Osorio , thank you very much .
It was great to have you here .
And we cannot see that as a problem .
That is fantastic .
Thank you very much .
Kevin Slavin : How algorithms shape our world
I don &apos;t know where we are now .
This is the Hang Seng index for Hong Kong .
And similar topography .
I wonder why .
And this is art . This is metaphor .
And I said , &quot; So what were you doing ? &quot;
How does that work ? &quot;
It &apos;s not just going to disappear .
That &apos;s good .
So you &apos;ve effectively negated 60 years of aeronautic research .
What &apos;s your act two ?
What do you do when you grow up ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; Well , financial services . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Oh . &quot;
Because those had been in the news lately .
And I said , &quot; How does that work ? &quot;
You just tip your hand .
And all of that &apos;s great , and it &apos;s fine .
And what could go wrong ?
Nobody had any control over what was actually happening .
And we &apos;re starting to make our way .
It &apos;s out of print -- still ...
And as with Amazon , so it is with Netflix .
They &apos;re using Pragmatic Chaos now .
Wouldn &apos;t that be handy ?
And the thing is , is that this isn &apos;t Google .
This isn &apos;t information .
These aren &apos;t financial stats ; this is culture .
What would it look like ?
These are two algorithms competing for your living room .
It &apos;s super-real and it &apos;s happening around you .
And it uses what &apos;s called a bin-packing algorithm .
And the problem with that is that people freak out .
People panic .
And you see why . You see why .
Like the things that people use .
And this is what we &apos;re designing for .
We &apos;re designing for this machine dialect .
You can take it really , really far .
So let me take it back to Wall Street .
And they operate on milliseconds and microseconds .
And that &apos;s going to keep happening .
Unfortunately , we have our work cut out for us .
This is just theoretical .
This is some mathematicians at MIT .
And it &apos;s not the money that &apos;s so interesting actually .
Thank you .
JP Rangaswami : Information is food
I love my food .
And I love information .
That was the family business .
And I mean books everywhere around the house .
It wasn &apos;t the only passion I had .
I was a South Indian brought up in Bengal .
And then life was fine , dandy .
Oh , some of you have seen it .
What changed was the balance of the tissues available .
It &apos;s a lady named Leslie Aiello .
We moved from that to becoming farmers and cultivators of information .
So there was always going to be a tension within that .
And this is happening here .
The same is again true with information .
But consumption was where it started getting really enjoyable .
They &apos;d buy it from the shop as raw ingredients .
Do you go to a restaurant ?
And by this time I was hooked .
And this is about 23 years into this process .
We start labeling information for the fact percentage ?
Which brings me to the final element of this .
Fundamentally it &apos;s a consumption issue .
Would there be time to be able to work with it ?
Thank you very much for your time .
Gary Slutkin : Let &apos;s treat violence like a contagious disease
There were many epidemics there .
After 10 years of working overseas , I was exhausted .
I really had very little left .
I had been traveling to one country after another .
I was emotionally feeling very isolated .
I wanted to come home .
I was not aware of any epidemic problems in America .
In fact -- seriously .
How many of you have such a situation ?
And now I do that .
What are you in America doing about it ?
And there were two essential explanations or ideas that were prevalent .
And one was punishment .
And this I had heard about before .
And I &apos;d heard this before as well .
Diarrheal diseases had been stuck .
Malaria had been stuck .
Frequently , a strategy has to be rethought .
What do the graphs look like ?
What does the data look like ?
There was clustering .
And it also looked like infectious epidemics .
Make sense ?
And there &apos;s special workers for doing that .
Just like T.B. , but the object is behavior change .
And then a bunch of community activities for changing norms .
They were using parks they weren &apos;t using before .
The sun was out . Everybody was happy .
And since that time , this has been replicated 20 times .
And even a movie was made around our work .
In other words , what do you mean , health problem ?
What do you mean , epidemic ?
What do you mean , no bad guys ?
And there &apos;s whole industries designed for managing bad people .
What do you mean , hiring people who have backgrounds ?
You must be doing something right . &quot;
My musician friends added the word &quot; dude . &quot;
Trauma centers and hospitals are doing their part in stepping up .
Thank you .
Jakob Trollback : A new kind of music video
And the song began to move on I understand like this .
And when Noah had done built his Ark ...
Move on ... In fact ... Concern ...
And then he went and knocked an old lady house .
Jason Clay : How big brands can help save biodiversity
I grew up on a small farm in Missouri .
I was going to work with small farmers .
I was going to help alleviate poverty .
You could be in New York .
It &apos;s not the work I set out to do .
I met a guy -- the guy on the left .
His name was Ben .
&quot; I make ice cream . &quot;
He said , &quot; Okay . &quot;
Within a year , Rainforest Crunch was on the shelves .
It was a great success .
That gets your adrenaline going .
We paid two to three times more than anybody else .
A great success .
It failed .
Why did it fail ?
We were attacking the wrong driver .
We needed to be working on beef .
We needed to be working on lumber .
So let &apos;s go back to Sudan .
Okay . Fast forward .
We live on a planet .
There &apos;s just one of them .
We know the limits of the resources we have .
We may be able to use them differently .
We may have some innovative , new ideas .
But in general , this is what we &apos;ve got .
Our work shows that we &apos;re living at about 1.3 planets .
Now we &apos;re at 1.3 .
If we were farmers , we &apos;d be eating our seed .
This is where we stand today .
It &apos;s always population growth .
You think that &apos;s not an issue going forward ?
Let &apos;s go back and visit our equation .
In 2000 , we had six billion people on the planet .
We have six billion units of consumption .
So we &apos;re going to have 18 billion units of consumption .
But that &apos;s what the math says .
We &apos;re not going to be able to do that .
We can get productivity up .
We can get efficiency up .
But we &apos;ve also got to get consumption down .
We need to use less to make more .
And then we need to use less again .
And then we need to consume less .
All of those things are part of that equation .
The average consumer takes 1.8 seconds in the U.S.
Okay , so let &apos;s be generous .
Let &apos;s say it &apos;s 3.5 seconds in Europe .
How do you get informed ?
You don &apos;t .
Here &apos;s a little question .
From a greenhouse gas perspective , is lamb produced in the U.K.
And there are many others .
How is a consumer going to walk through this minefield ?
They &apos;re not .
Sustainability has got to be a pre-competitive issue .
It &apos;s got to be something we all care about .
And we need collusion .
We need groups to work together that never have .
We need Cargill to work with Bunge .
We need Coke to work with Pepsi .
We need Oxford to work with Cambridge .
We need Greenpeace to work with WWF .
Everybody &apos;s got to work together -- China and the U.S.
But we can &apos;t do everything .
We have to work in these places .
We looked at the threats to these places .
Are we going to work with 6.9 billion consumers ?
Are we going to work with 1.5 billion producers ?
Again , a daunting task .
There must be a better way .
So , we went through our 15 commodities .
This is nine of them .
So we did the analysis again a slightly different way .
And what we found is it &apos;s 25 percent .
We can get our arms around a hundred companies .
A hundred companies , we can work with .
Why is 25 percent important ?
Companies can push producers faster than consumers can .
We can &apos;t wait that long .
We don &apos;t have that kind of time .
We need change that &apos;s going to accelerate .
We need to begin to work with industries .
It &apos;s not all fun and games .
Eight entities came to the table .
Three of the original eight entities were suing each other .
It can happen .
So what brings the different entities to the table ?
It &apos;s risk and demand .
So it &apos;s the demand that brings them to the table .
So we &apos;re pulling out all the stops .
Why is Cargill important ?
Because Cargill has 20 to 25 percent of global palm oil .
That &apos;s not insignificant .
It &apos;s a pre-competitive issue .
All the palm oil going there is good .
Buy it .
Mars is also on a similar journey .
The rest of the land can be used for something else .
It &apos;s more with less and less again .
That is an externality by definition .
This is the subsidy from nature .
These companies have begun to think differently .
They &apos;re on a journey ; there &apos;s no turning back .
We &apos;re all on that same journey with them .
Thank you .
Elizabeth Lindsey : Curating humanity &apos;s heritage
The year is 1963 .
We &apos;re at the ocean .
It &apos;s twilight .
It &apos;s a stretch of beach we know so well .
The smooth stones on the sand are familiar to us .
That would be a mistake .
There &apos;s a new moon on the horizon .
Hawaiians say it &apos;s a good night for fishing .
They begin to chant .
They want to teach me about my destiny .
I thought every seven-year-old went through this .
&quot; Baby girl , someday the world will be in trouble .
People will forget their wisdom .
You will go far away .
It will sometimes be a lonely road .
We will not be there .
And it will take all of you .
It will take all of you . &quot;
These words , I hold onto all my life .
Because the idea of doing it alone terrifies me .
The year is 2007 .
I &apos;m on a remote island in Micronesia .
Satawal is one half-mile long by one mile wide .
It &apos;s the home of my mentor .
His name is Pius Mau Piailug .
Mau is a palu , a navigator priest .
He &apos;s also considered the greatest wave finder in the world .
We are in such a critical moment of our collective history .
Their canoes , our rockets ; their sea , our space .
This is part of our collective narrative .
It &apos;s humanity &apos;s DNA .
We cannot afford to lose it .
The year is 2010 .
We must course-correct .
The link between the past and the future is fragile .
This whole notion of every man for himself is completely unsustainable .
It always was .
True navigation begins in the human heart .
It &apos;s the most important map of all .
Together , may we journey well .
Barton Seaver : Sustainable seafood ? Let &apos;s get smart
The who and the why are what &apos;s important to me .
I want to know the people behind my dinner choices .
I want to know how I impact them .
I want to know how they impact me .
I want to know why they fish .
So what do we call this ?
I think we call it restorative seafood .
Green , yellow and red lists &#91; of &#93; seafood species .
But what if we eat only in the green list ?
Pole caught -- no bycatch .
Great for fishermen . Lots of money . Supporting local economies .
What &apos;s the context of this meal ?
Do I do this three times a week ?
That &apos;s great ! I love red wine !
Well folks , we have a protein problem .
The problem is we are hiding that cost beneath the waves .
And we are hiding that cost behind monster profits .
Vegetables : they might yet save the oceans .
Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green .
But we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables .
Whooo !
This is an easy sell .
There &apos;s a pattern here .
So I think we have this whole eating thing wrong .
So let &apos;s start there .
We have eco-friendly shrimp .
We can make them ; we have that technology .
But we can never have any eco-friendly all-you-can-eat shrimp buffet .
It doesn &apos;t work .
Heart-healthy dinner is a very important part of restorative seafood .
That &apos;s a reward I am not willing to pass up .
But it &apos;s not all about the seafood .
It &apos;s about the way that we look at our plates .
A couple things happened .
I made more money .
They got more calories over the course of a diversified meal .
They got healthier . I made more money .
This is great .
We were directing tastes towards more resilience , more restorative options .
This is what we need to favor .
This is what the green list says .
Start with a 16-ounce portion of big fish .
Get a knife . Cut it into four portions .
Put it on four plates .
Celebrate the opportunity you have to eat this .
I expect a lot from food .
I expect health and joy and family and community .
I was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook .
I remember well the meals of my childhood .
This is still how I largely eat today .
I get sick when I go to steakhouses .
I get the meat sweats .
It &apos;s like a hangover from protein .
It &apos;s disgusting .
Eat your vegetables .
It &apos;s pretty straightforward .
So what are we looking for in a meal ?
For community though , we start at the very beginning .
We need to savor vegetables .
We need to savor smaller portions of seafood .
And we need to save dinner .
Thank you .
Rives : A mockingbird remix of TED2006
Mockingbirds are badass .
They are .
They listen and mimic and remix what they like .
They rock the mic outside my window every morning .
So check it , I &apos;m gonna to catch mockingbirds .
I &apos;ll get your postman making dinner plans .
I &apos;ll get the last time you lied .
I &apos;ll get everyone &apos;s good mornings .
I don &apos;t care how you make &apos; em .
Aloha . Konichiwa . Shalom . Ah-Salam Alaikum .
Everybody means everybody , means everybody here .
And so maybe I &apos;ll build a gilded cage .
I &apos;ll line the bottom with old notebook pages .
What does a violin have to do with technology ?
Where in the world is this world heading ?
We are 12 billion light years from the edge .
That &apos;s a guess .
There &apos;s about 10 million phage per job .
It &apos;s a very strange world inside a nanotube .
Everybody gets heard .
Everybody gets this one , honest mockingbird as a witness .
And I &apos;m on this .
Wait for the man with the mockingbird . &quot;
Thank you , TED .
Wow .
Wow .
So I was filming .
But they are .
They &apos;re called self-settlers .
They did so illegally .
Otherwise , I &apos;m going home . &quot;
Now why would they return to such deadly soil ?
Another village might have six or seven residents .
She &apos;s the self-declared mayor of Kapavati village , population eight .
It turns out this holds true for other species as well .
And there &apos;s a patina of simple defiance among them .
I mean , what about their health ?
It &apos;s incredibly difficult to parse .
Health studies from the region are conflicting and fraught .
Home is a transient concept .
&quot; If you leave , you die . &quot;
&quot; Those who left are worse off now .
They are dying of sadness . &quot;
&quot; Motherland is motherland . I will never leave . &quot;
How could this be ?
Home and community are forces that rival even radiation .
Thank you .
Marcin Jakubowski : Open-sourced blueprints for civilization
Hi , my name is Marcin -- farmer , technologist .
I was born in Poland , now in the U.S.
I started a group called Open Source Ecology .
We call this the Global Village Construction Set .
So let me tell you a story .
I had no practical skills .
The world presented me with options , and I took them .
I guess you can call it the consumer lifestyle .
I bought a tractor -- then it broke .
I paid to get it repaired -- then it broke again .
Then pretty soon , I was broke too .
I found that I would have to build them myself .
So I did just that .
And I tested them .
So far , we have prototyped eight of the 50 machines .
And now the project is beginning to grow on its own .
And the same is starting to happen with hardware too .
That &apos;s not only in the developing world .
I &apos;ve planted a hundred trees in a day .
From what I &apos;ve seen , this is only the beginning .
Thank you .
Neil Harbisson : I listen to color
For example , this is the sound of grass .
This is red , like TED .
This is the sound of a dirty sock .
Which is like yellow , this one .
I didn &apos;t have to think about the notes .
And after some time , this perception became a feeling .
This is my passport from 2004 .
It &apos;s like going to a nightclub .
It &apos;s full of different melodies . Yeah .
Especially the aisle with cleaning products .
It &apos;s just fabulous .
Also , the way I dress has changed .
Now I dress in a way that it sounds good .
Here &apos;s some faces .
Yeah , Nicole Kidman sounds good .
Prince Charles has some similarities with Nicole Kidman .
They have similar sound of eyes .
And here &apos;s some music translated into color .
And this is a completely different song .
It &apos;s Justin Bieber &apos;s &quot; Baby . &quot;
It is very pink and very yellow .
I would encourage you to become a cyborg .
You won &apos;t be alone . Thank you .
Clay Shirky : How cognitive surplus will change the world
And she quickly said , &quot; It &apos;s too much .
If only there was a way to automate this . &quot;
It &apos;s since been deployed in Mexico to track electoral fraud .
It &apos;s been deployed in Washington D.C. to track snow cleanup .
What Okolloh did would not have been possible without human generosity .
That is the resource that I &apos;m talking about .
I call it cognitive surplus .
Cognitive surplus is made up of two things .
That &apos;s the second half of cognitive surplus .
We still like to consume , of course .
Designing .
The gap is between doing anything and doing nothing .
But media abundance never works that way .
Freedom to experiment means freedom to experiment with anything .
And that source is design for generosity .
Simple , straightforward , commonsensical -- also , largely untested .
So they divided the daycare centers into two groups .
Boom . No ifs , ands or buts . &quot;
And you can see immediately what happened , right ?
The fine broke the culture of the daycare center .
What could be bad ? &quot;
But that &apos;s not right .
They were operating with social constraints rather than contractual ones .
And then a really interesting thing happens : Nothing changes .
This brings me back to the LOLcats and to Ushahidi .
This is , I think , the range that matters .
Both of these rely on cognitive surplus .
It &apos;s value created by the participants for each other .
Ushahidi , by contrast , is civic value .
That will be true year-in and year-out .
Kamen said , &quot; Free cultures get what they celebrate . &quot;
We &apos;ve got a choice before us .
We &apos;ve got this trillion hours a year .
That , we get for free .
we &apos;ll be able to change society .
Thank you very much .
Majora Carter : 3 stories of local eco-entrepreneurship
The first one is happening right here in Chicago .
We know that two-thirds of them are going to go back .
Talk about a sweet beginning .
Now Judy Bonds is a coal miner &apos;s daughter .
That kind of technology is called &quot; mountaintop removal . &quot;
And Judy saw her landscape being destroyed and her water poisoned .
The water is turned into goo .
Not quite an obvious alliance .
Yeah .
And it has since moved to her bones and her brain .
But her dream of Coal River Mountain Wind is her legacy .
And she might not get to see that mountaintop .
That &apos;s what my homegirl is doing .
So I &apos;m so proud of that .
Now they &apos;re all very practical visionaries .
I think that number &apos;s probably going to go up .
And there are plenty of other examples like that .
One problem : waste handling and unemployment .
And where is this waste handled ? Usually in poor communities .
They &apos;ve since abandoned that project , thank goodness .
Another problem : unhealthy food systems and unemployment .
The numbers just aren &apos;t there .
It allies in a really positive and economically viable food system .
This is smart infrastructure .
So I &apos;m hoping you can see a little theme here .
These examples indicate a trend .
And we all need to be invested in it .
It is an essential pillar to this country &apos;s recovery .
And I call it &quot; hometown security . &quot;
The sum of the local is the global .
Many great and inspiring solutions have been generated across America .
But , like all of us , he had some problems .
And his was gambling , compulsively .
So you need to help him out .
So I &apos;m not that unhappy about that .
But I really did struggle for financial support .
But I did in fact get married in it .
Over here .
Hometown security is next on my to-do list .
Thank you very much .
Brian Cox : CERN &apos;s supercollider
This is the Large Hadron Collider .
It &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference .
It &apos;s the biggest scientific experiment ever attempted .
We collide them inside giant detectors .
They &apos;re essentially digital cameras .
And this is the one that I work on , ATLAS .
This is a picture about a year ago .
Those magnets are in there .
Yeah , it &apos;s a wonderful achievement .
So , you might be asking , &quot; Why ?
Well , particle physicists are nothing if not ambitious .
Absolutely everything .
It &apos;s almost like ...
The quarks are stuck together by other things called gluons .
But , without it , the sun wouldn &apos;t shine .
Just up the road .
Relative to the universe , it &apos;s just up the road .
It &apos;s called the standard model -- beautifully simple mathematical equation .
This is it .
But there &apos;s a problem .
Can anyone see what it is ?
A bottle of champagne for anyone that tells me .
But there &apos;s an extra symbol in this equation : H.
Right , H.
H stands for Higgs particle .
Higgs particles have not been discovered .
What does it do ?
I want to know what this Higgs particle does . &quot;
Higgs particles , if you will .
It &apos;s almost like they get heavy . They get massive .
And that &apos;s exactly the way the Higgs mechanism works .
They &apos;re interacting with the Higgs field .
I &apos;m glad you recognize Margaret Thatcher .
So that &apos;s one thing .
That &apos;s essentially a guarantee of what the LHC will find .
Well , they do change in strength .
But they just miss .
So a very compelling theory that &apos;s really mainstream physics .
Many other things that the LHC could discover .
Gravity separated away from the other forces .
The universe then underwent an exponential expansion called inflation .
The universe continued to expand and cool .
It continued to expand about 300 million years .
Then light began to travel through the universe .
They then re-collapsed into another generation of stars and planets .
Absolutely remarkable .
And , the laws of physics . Right ?
And I think that &apos;s a wonderful and significant story .
So that &apos;s the LHC .
Thanks .
Lisa Harouni : A primer on 3D printing
This is a 3D printer .
Many barriers are breaking down .
So how does it work ?
They were all 3D printed .
The design is quite extraordinary .
It sounds great .
It is great .
We can have 3D printers today that build structures like these .
This is almost three meters high .
This was created by an architectural firm called Shiro .
And you can actually walk into it .
It &apos;s created depositing layers of about four microns .
So really the resolution is quite incredible .
The detail that you can get today is quite amazing .
So who &apos;s using it ?
There &apos;s very little economies of scale .
So you can now create one-offs very easily .
Again , not buildable in any other way .
And very hard to even create this by hand .
Now this is an engine component .
And it &apos;s used by aerospace and automotive .
It &apos;s a lighter part and it uses less material waste .
There &apos;s a lower chance of rejection .
But it &apos;s very hard to create that in standard ways .
They &apos;re also now small enough to sit on a desktop .
You &apos;re having machines fabricate themselves .
You can just make it physically on the spot .
We &apos;re all familiar with the idea of customization or personalization .
Brands like Nike are doing it .
It &apos;s all over the Web .
This is a lamp .
And you can start iterating the design .
Because obviously the public are not professional product designers .
But I don &apos;t think that that &apos;s immediate .
I don &apos;t think that will happen soon .
This means lower carbon footprint .
Here &apos;s the product being built .
It &apos;s this lamp , as you can see here .
Or we can create very specific prosthetics for that individual .
It &apos;s very intricate .
So just to finalize , we &apos;re all individual .
We all have different preferences , different needs .
We like different things .
We &apos;re all different sizes and our companies the same .
Businesses want different things .
Thank you .
Homaro Cantu + Ben Roche : Cooking as alchemy
Ben Roche : So I &apos;m Ben , by the way .
Homaro Cantu : And I &apos;m Homaro .
So this dish in particular is basically champagne with seafood .
BR : But it &apos;s not all just edible pictures .
HC : Delicious .
BR : That &apos;s not it , though .
So this is a plate of nachos .
You see a cow with its tongue hanging out .
And why is it delicious ?
And basically the reaction tends to be kind of like this .
They &apos;re hard to just get automatically .
So the key now is to make it behave like tuna .
But where is this going ?
So here &apos;s the next challenge .
BR : Thanks , guys .
Tavi Gevinson : A teen just trying to figure it out
But they &apos;re not strong characters who happen to be female .
They &apos;re completely flat , and they &apos;re basically cardboard characters .
So the flaws are the key .
I &apos;m not the first person to say this .
Congrats , guys .
You can &apos;t be smart and pretty .
But , yeah .
I got about 3,000 emails .
If you use that , you can get away with anything .
Like , that &apos;s all you have to do .
Thank you .
Rob Reid : The $ 8 billion iPod
... if we use pennies .
But it &apos;s also a morally important one .
So that &apos;s a chunk of what we &apos;re looking for .
And TV , satellite and cable revenues are way up .
Other content markets like book publishing and radio are also up .
So this small missing chunk here is puzzling .
It &apos;s true .
I have Excel .
Other data has the music industry at about 45,000 people .
And some people think that string theory is tough .
And it was a big Christmas hit .
Or about 75,000 jobs .
So that &apos;s it for now .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Judy MacDonald Johnston : Prepare for a good end of life
What would be a good end of life ?
And I &apos;m talking about the very end .
I &apos;m talking about dying .
We all think a lot about how to live well .
I &apos;m not a geriatrician .
I design reading programs for preschoolers .
This was their dream .
I met Jim and Shirley in their 80s .
They were both only children who chose not to have kids .
It &apos;s true .
This gave them the peace of mind to move forward .
It might be a diagnosis . It might be your intuition .
Dying from cancer and dying from neurological illness are different .
In both cases , last days are about quiet reassurance .
From this experience I &apos;m going to share five practices .
It starts with a plan .
This is not a plan either ; this is illegal .
A plan involves answering straightforward questions about the end you want .
What do you want in terms of medical intervention ?
And who &apos;s going to make sure your plan is followed ?
You will need advocates .
Don &apos;t assume the natural choice is your spouse or child .
Hospital readiness is critical .
Have advocates keep a set in their car .
Tape a set to your refrigerator .
You &apos;re going to need caregivers .
In either case , do not settle .
Finally , last words .
Thank you .
Ellen Gustafson : Obesity + hunger = 1 global food issue
I &apos;m Ellen , and I &apos;m totally obsessed with food .
But I didn &apos;t start out obsessed with food .
&quot; What are you doing for America &apos;s kids ? &quot;
I mean that &apos;s pretty dramatic for our own country .
Unfortunately , obesity &apos;s not only an American problem .
The numbers are pretty crazy .
Well , they &apos;re both about food .
And agriculture is where food comes from .
Well , agriculture in America &apos;s very interesting .
Who is farming them ? That &apos;s what I was wondering .
And their farms are also large .
Most hungry people in the world are subsistence farmers .
Unfortunately , what is farmed ends up as what we eat .
It &apos;s crazy .
A fifth of kids under two drinks soda .
Hello . You don &apos;t put soda in bottles .
So the problematic food system is affecting both hunger and obesity .
I think that &apos;s the only way to look at it .
You know , there &apos;s 30-year cycles .
And it &apos;ll be growing over the next few months .
Two young scientists break down plastics with bacteria
Miranda Wang : We &apos;re here to talk about accidents .
How do you feel about accidents ?
But are they always that bad ?
This picture you see here is the Great Pacific Gyre .
And what about the waste that &apos;s already been produced ?
Plastics take hundreds to thousands of years to biodegrade .
So we thought , you know what ?
Sounds cool , right ?
Audience : Yeah . JY : Thank you .
But we had a problem .
As a result , they easily escape into our environment .
Everything went well from there , and we became amazing scientists .
MW : Okay . Well , it was partially my fault .
But this mistake turned out to be rather serendipitous .
This means that our bacteria were actually living off of phthalates .
So this fully shows that nature evolves through natural selection .
Thank you . JY : Thank you .
Natalie Merchant : Singing old poems to life
Ghosts , right ?
Taking them off the dead , flat pages .
Bringing them to life , bringing them to light .
Nathalia Crane was a little girl from Brooklyn .
Here she is .
And here &apos;s her poem .
It was written by Laurence Alma-Tadema .
One was his daughter , Laurence .
Thank you .
And the burning question about Alma-Tadema was : Did she marry ?
Gerard Manley Hopkins , a saintly man .
He became a Jesuit .
He converted from his Anglican faith .
And the poem is called , &quot; Spring and Fall . &quot;
everyone that blew my mind this week .
Thank you .
Just bring it down a little .
It &apos;s my turn .
I still have two minutes .
Okay , we &apos;re going to start that verse again .
I have so much admiration for him .
I &apos;ll show you how to clap to this song .
Decrescendo .
Gradually , bringing it down , bringing it down .
Thank you so much .
Esta Soler : How we turned the tide on domestic violence
We were making what was invisible visible .
I &apos;ve been doing this for 30 years .
Why do I believe this ?
Because it &apos;s true .
It is absolutely true .
Sixty-four percent . Now , how did we get there ?
Our eyes were wide open .
There was no justice .
And as an activist , that was not good enough .
And you know what else we did ?
Right ?
I was probably 30 and naive .
Do you know what he called this important piece of legislation ?
He called it the Take the Fun Out of Marriage Act .
The Take the Fun Out of Marriage Act .
Thank you .
And you know what else it did ? It collected data .
In fact , I am a data nerd .
I &apos;m sure there are a lot of data nerds here .
Take a look at one of our spots .
Where &apos;s dinner ?
Please don &apos;t — Let go of me !
Get in the kitchen ! No ! Help !
You want to see what hurts ?
That &apos;s what hurts ! That &apos;s what hurts !
Help me !
We learned that he had a long history of domestic violence .
The media became fixated .
Movements are about moments , and we seized this moment .
And let me just put this in context .
I &apos;ll tell you : 158 .
And in the 2000s , over 7,000 .
We were obviously making a difference .
But we were still missing a critical element .
So , step four : We needed to engage men .
And I already told you I &apos;m a data nerd .
So we wondered , how can we include men ?
I apologize to the men in the audience .
I know you do .
They do talk to their kids .
They talk to their kids as parents , as coaches . &quot;
And that &apos;s what we did .
She sat right down next to him .
And as a parent , I get it .
We &apos;ve done a lot for adult women .
We &apos;ve got to do a better job for our kids .
We just do . We have to .
Technology has been our friend .
Really . I clap for you .
You can &apos;t make that one up .
Thank you very much .
Edward Burtynsky : Photographing the landscape of oil
I started my journey 30 years ago .
It was 23 metric tons for one liter .
And together they only form about 15 years of supply .
Henry Markram : A brain in a supercomputer
Why are we doing this ?
There are three important reasons .
It runs out of space .
They are confused , and you cannot make a decision .
He &apos;s at home having tea .
It is what you infer about that room .
We can ask a very concrete question .
&quot; Can the brain build such a perception ? &quot;
Is it capable of doing it ?
Does it have the substance to do it ?
It had to improve it a little bit .
But the real big step was the neocortex .
It &apos;s a new brain . You needed it .
And it has not stopped its evolutionary path .
But there are about a million of them .
Each of these neocortical columns would produce a note .
You stimulate it ; it produces a symphony .
But it &apos;s not just a symphony of perception .
It &apos;s a symphony of your universe , your reality .
But it &apos;s not only education .
It &apos;s also genetics .
How many trees does it have ?
What shapes are the trees ?
They choose very carefully who they connect with .
And here we &apos;re coiling them up .
Every neuron is different .
And you may have more or less neurons .
Well , we don &apos;t have to speculate .
We can look at all 10 million synapses now .
We can use different neurons with different variations .
We can use less or more of them .
But the pattern of how the circuitry is designed does not .
So , we have the mathematics to make neurons come alive .
And we &apos;ve got the mathematics to describe this process .
So we can describe the communication between the neurons .
But what you do need is a very big computer .
So you need 10,000 laptops .
So now we have this Blue Gene supercomputer .
Take the magic carpet for a ride .
It &apos;s the first view .
But we can ask , &quot; Where is the rose ? &quot;
Where is it inside the neocortex ?
Because that is what it &apos;s creating .
It &apos;s creating electrical patterns .
Antonio Damasio : The quest to understand consciousness
We would have no pains , but also no joys .
So much for the wonder , now for the mystery .
And this is a person who is alive .
This is not a person that is being studied at autopsy .
But at any rate , they are there .
At any rate , what is consciousness ?
What is a conscious mind ?
That flow of mental images is mind .
We have selves .
We own our minds .
Everything is nice and fine and perpendicular .
Very odd -- I &apos;ve analyzed this for a while .
On the right side , my retina is perfectly symmetrical .
And it corresponds to a little cyst that is located below .
So from the retina you go onto visual cortex .
So think about how wonderfully convenient and lazy the brain is .
So it provides certain areas for perception and image-making .
But what about the self ?
The self is really the elusive problem .
And I thought about a solution to this problem .
It &apos;s the following .
Well it so happens that we have a singular body .
We have one body , not two , not three .
And so that is a beginning .
There is just one reference point , which is the body .
So that &apos;s one more element for this continuity .
It is that specific .
So now I &apos;m going to show you a picture .
So what is the picture that we get here ?
But look at the arrows .
They &apos;re not there for looks .
They &apos;re there because there &apos;s this very close interaction .
That &apos;s where the difference is .
But the novelty is here .
It is developed in the cultures .
It developed in collectives of human beings .
Three reasons . First , curiosity .
Primates are extremely curious -- and humans most of all .
Second , understanding society and culture .
And finally , medicine .
Thank you for your attention .
Paul Bennett : Design is in the details
And how do you bring those two things together ?
And that &apos;s what I want to talk about today .
The first thing we actually shared with them was this .
I &apos;ll play this until your eyeballs completely dissolve .
This is 59 seconds into the film .
This is a minute 59 .
3 : 19 .
5 : 10 .
5 : 58 .
6 : 20 .
And so , that was a really catalytic thing for them .
So they snapped into action .
They said , OK , it &apos;s not about systemic change .
Very small example of something that they could do .
The first thing they do is they decorated the ceiling .
So you went from public space to private space .
I thought that was a really , really nice example .
It &apos;s a history of invention based around this .
And he invented the shipping container .
Blinkered vision tends to produce , I think , blinkered solutions .
Again , another medical example here .
They &apos;ll ask the nurses to input data .
And I think that &apos;s really , really important .
So , again , this idea of workarounds .
Why do we all follow the line in the street ?
This is a picture in a Japanese subway .
We don &apos;t know why , but we do .
Why do we wrap the teabag string around the cup handle ?
This is people designing their own experiences .
You can draw from this .
It &apos;s there for our use , on some level .
I talk about unthinking situations all the time .
Children assume permission in a very different way .
Children live on things . They live under things .
So , what came out of this ?
This is the storage system that he designed .
And then use that information to fuel solutions ?
And I think that &apos;s what this is very much about .
Last section : green armband . We &apos;ve all got them .
It &apos;s about this really .
They &apos;re now called KickStart .
And that was completely irrelevant .
We had to completely transfer ourselves over to their world .
These guys are using this very successfully .
There it is , pumping water from 30 feet .
We feel that this is an important gesture .
I hope you &apos;ll all wear them .
So that &apos;s it . Thank you .
Eric X. Li : A tale of two political systems
Good morning .
My name is Eric Li , and I was born here .
But no , I wasn &apos;t born there .
It went like this .
Communism !
And the Chinese bought it .
We were taught that grand story day in and day out .
It became part of us , and we believed in it .
The story was a bestseller .
Then , the world changed overnight .
This one was just as grand .
Paradise on Earth , again .
George H.W. Bush : A new world order ...
George W. Bush : ... ending tyranny in our world ...
Those who buy the prospectus are destined for success .
Those who do not are doomed to fail .
But this time , the Chinese didn &apos;t buy it .
Fool me once ...
The rest is history .
Six hundred fifty million people were lifted out of poverty .
See , I grew up on this stuff : food stamps .
Needless to say , I ate all my grandmother &apos;s portions .
So I asked myself , what &apos;s wrong with this picture ?
Entrepreneurs are starting companies every day .
Well , the assumptions are wrong .
The opposites are true .
It won &apos;t last long because it cannot adapt .
Now here are the facts .
So the Party self-corrects in rather dramatic fashions .
Institutionally , new rules get enacted to correct previous dysfunctions .
For example , term limits .
The truth is , political reforms have never stopped .
Now , this may be counterintuitive to you .
They form separate yet integrated career paths for Chinese officials .
It &apos;s serious business .
Once a year , the department reviews their performance .
They conduct public opinion surveys .
Then they promote the winners .
There , they enter high officialdom .
The process takes two to three decades .
Does patronage play a role ? Yes , of course .
But merit remains the fundamental driver .
Even for him , the career took 30 years .
Now , please don &apos;t get me wrong , okay ?
George W. Bush , remember him ?
This is not a put-down .
Well , apparently he hadn &apos;t heard of the Organization Department .
Where is the source of legitimacy ? &quot;
I said , &quot; How about competency ? &quot;
We all know the facts .
Satisfaction with the direction of the country : 85 percent .
Democracy is becoming a perpetual cycle of elect and regret .
The country faces enormous challenges .
Pollution is one . Food safety . Population issues .
On the political front , the worst problem is corruption .
Corruption is widespread and undermines the system and its moral legitimacy .
But most analysts misdiagnose the disease .
But a more careful look would tell us otherwise .
Now , I &apos;m a venture capitalist . I make bets .
So here they are .
In the next 10 years , China will surpass the U.S.
and become the largest economy in the world .
We live in the dusk of an era .
Meta-narrative is the cancer that is killing democracy from the inside .
Now , I want to clarify something .
I &apos;m not here to make an indictment of democracy .
It cannot be exported . But that is the point precisely .
Let us draw to a close this era of meta-narratives .
It is wrong . It is irresponsible .
And worst of all , it is boring .
Let universality make way for plurality .
Perhaps a more interesting age is upon us .
Are we brave enough to welcome it ?
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thanks .
Do you know who their biggest client is ?
The Chinese government .
They conduct surveys all the time .
Are you happy with the garbage collection ?
Are you happy with the general direction of the country ?
Many seem to agree .
But it &apos;s different . You wouldn &apos;t recognize it .
Hod Lipson : Building &quot; self-aware &quot; robots
So , where are the robots ?
Very soon they &apos;ll be doing everything for us .
Let &apos;s see what evolution can do for us .
But this machine doesn &apos;t know what it looks like .
So , we &apos;ll move forward to a different idea .
So we have these cubes , like the diagram showed here .
Dee Boersma : Pay attention to penguins
I want to talk about penguins today .
Now there are over 30,000 .
There were two Jeeps on Santa Cruz .
We &apos;re not paying the true environmental costs of our actions .
But moreover , I &apos;d never lived on an uninhabited island .
But it &apos;s alive with life ; it &apos;s hardly uninhabited .
Humans , without fins : 90 meters , 3.5 minutes .
You have to train to be able to do that .
So penguins are amazing athletes .
And , more importantly , they &apos;re well-dressed .
So they have all the criteria that people normally like .
But scientifically , they &apos;re amazing because they &apos;re sentinels .
And that &apos;s what I came to study .
These are the rarest penguins in the world .
But the population has changed dramatically since I was first here .
And this is true of most of our living systems .
This is a cold-water event called La Nina .
things die when there &apos;s no food .
They &apos;re not breeding ; they &apos;re not even around .
I studied marine iguanas at that point .
But this is a global phenomenon , we know that .
There were plenty of them .
This is one of the plights of penguins : oil pollution .
So they were just minding their own business .
You can &apos;t find oiled penguins in Argentina .
Why are there even these penguins oiled ?
So now I want to show you that penguins are affected .
I &apos;m just going to talk about two things .
The same thing &apos;s true for penguins as well .
And some of you consider them almost part of your family .
This is Turbo the Penguin .
Turbo &apos;s never been fed .
So this is Turbo .
And you can see , he &apos;s not trying to bite .
What is this guy doing ?
This is really pretty weird . &quot;
And you &apos;ll see soon that my graduate student ...
And now look at this : not friendly .
This is a radio frequency ID system .
Okay , so here are a few penguins coming in .
See , this one &apos;s coming back to its nest .
And then there &apos;s another fellow that will leisurely come by .
Then I realize that they &apos;re playing king of the box .
He unplugs the wire ; we have no data .
So , they really are pretty amazing creatures .
OK .
So , thank you very much .
Roger Stein : A bold new way to fund drug research
I &apos;m the one with the blond hair .
My dad &apos;s the guy with the cigarette .
Cancer is one of those things that actually touches everybody .
of being diagnosed with cancer .
Everybody knows somebody who &apos;s been diagnosed with cancer .
There are over 200 kinds of cancer .
Now I &apos;m not a scientist .
So the FDA has a very specific protocol .
And it turns out , that &apos;s a pretty high hurdle .
About a third of all drugs drop out at that point .
And that &apos;s also a higher hurdle . People drop out .
If not , then why build it ?
Does that sound like a good deal for anybody ?
No . No , right ?
What if we start thinking about them as financial assets ? &quot;
Let &apos;s create a giant fund .
So again , financial engineering was helpful here .
It &apos;s almost self-funding .
We spent the next two years doing research .
We talked to people who have developed drugs .
We talked to pharmaceutical companies .
And all that actually took a lot of time .
So we published some articles in the academic press .
We published articles in medical journals .
We published articles in finance journals .
We wanted people to get involved .
That &apos;s a hundred thousand billion .
There &apos;s plenty of money .
Could you start a work stream on the regulatory aspects ?
The conference was held over the summer , this past summer .
It was an invitation-only conference .
So I &apos;d like to think it was a good sign .
Because , again , I &apos;m not a scientist .
I can &apos;t build a drug .
Thank you .
Jessica Jackley : Poverty , money -- and love
The stories we tell about each other matter very much .
The stories we tell ourselves about our own lives matter .
This is what Jesus asked of us .
Now I was pretty psyched .
And I felt overwhelmed .
And I even felt a sense of shame because of that .
And so naturally , I started to distance myself .
And I stopped expecting things to really change .
I mean who can argue with that ?
It was an amazing sort of insight for me .
Their business trajectory would change .
They might be able to buy mosquito nets .
That was another thing that really touched me .
So I saw that and it was very humbling .
Anyway , another interesting thing happened while I was there .
I just got this impression that the money would work .
The money came in basically overnight .
We sent it over to Uganda .
We said , &quot; Our little experiment has been a success .
The second year , it was a total of 15 million .
The third year , the total was up to around 40 .
The fourth year , we were just short of 100 .
I hope that Kiva can blur those lines .
Now for me , Kiva is just the beginning .
So they &apos;re not a donation .
Yeah , maybe it doesn &apos;t sound that much different .
has led to the things that I &apos;m working on now .
But there &apos;s always a need for resources close by .
it actually flows with the up and down .
And we allow entrepreneurs to share a percentage of their revenues .
So that &apos;s what I &apos;m working on now .
And I think I can remind us that we do care .
I think we all already know that .
Just a sec .
Thanks .
Thanks .
Thank you .
Rick Warren : A life of purpose
I &apos;m often asked , what surprises you about the book ?
And I said , that I got to write it .
This thing &apos;s selling still about a million copies a month .
Just existing .
I really think that &apos;s there &apos;s this inner desire .
I don &apos;t think there are accidental kids .
And I think you matter .
Why do I feel like a fake ?
These are not religious issues -- they &apos;re human issues .
As a pastor , I do see a lot of kooks .
I &apos;m going , OK , you know . Fine .
Um .
Good for you .
And that was : what is the purpose of this ?
Because it brought in enormous amounts of money .
When I started Saddleback Church , I was 25 years old .
I started it with one other family in 1980 .
Everybody &apos;s betting their life on something .
I just don &apos;t believe that .
That &apos;s kind of a no-brainer .
So , what is it for ?
So I believe , essentially , that leadership is stewardship .
It &apos;s not going to be mine after I die .
And he said , &quot; No . &quot;
And he said , &quot; No .
Not any more than any other species . &quot;
You &apos;re not a duck .
And you are responsible -- that &apos;s my worldview .
And so , you need to understand what your worldview is .
The problem is most people never really think it through .
This is why I believe what I believe . &quot;
I don &apos;t personally have enough faith to be an atheist .
But you may , you may .
It determines , really , everything in your life .
I didn &apos;t go out and buy a bigger house .
I don &apos;t own a guesthouse .
I still drive the same four-year-old Ford that I &apos;ve driven .
Pastors are like on 24-hours-a-day call . They &apos;re like doctors .
It makes a difference what you believe .
It &apos;s all about more , having more .
But that &apos;s not the good life .
It &apos;s just not true .
Giving your life away .
It doesn &apos;t come from sex .
It doesn &apos;t come from salary .
It comes from serving .
That , actually , was the easy part .
Because I start getting all kinds of invitations .
And being a pastor , I started reading the Bible .
That &apos;s what he prays .
He says , &quot; I want you to make me famous .
I want you to give me power .
I want you to make me famous .
I want you to give me influence . &quot;
Until you read the whole psalm , the whole chapter .
Basically , he &apos;s talking about all the marginalized in society .
They &apos;re not on my radar .
I have a church full of CEOs and scientists .
They &apos;re just not in my pathway .
What &apos;s in your hand ?
Moses says , &quot; It &apos;s a staff .
It &apos;s a shepherd &apos;s staff . &quot;
And God says , &quot; Throw it down . &quot;
And then God says , &quot; Pick it up . &quot;
Number one , God never does a miracle to show off .
But He doesn &apos;t do miracles just to show off .
Now , what was in Moses &apos; hand ?
This staff represented three things about Moses &apos; life .
First , it represented his identity .
Your assets are tied up in your flocks .
What do you do with a shepherd &apos;s staff ?
What &apos;s in your hand ? &quot;
I &apos;ll do some things you could never imagine possible . &quot;
You &apos;re an NBA player . It represents your income .
You &apos;re making a lot of money off that little ball .
And it represents your influence .
And that gives with you enormous influence .
What do you have that you &apos;ve been given ?
What are you doing with what you &apos;ve been given ?
That , to me , is the primary question about life .
These things shape you .
If you &apos;re wired to make deals , you make deals .
If you &apos;re wired to paint , you paint .
Did you know that God smiles when you be you ?
That &apos;s my girl .
It &apos;s about making the world a better place . &quot;
Thank you .
Stefan Wolff : The path to ending ethnic conflicts
Three things stand out : leadership , diplomacy and institutional design .
But let &apos;s start at the beginning .
So are these now the images of the past ?
But this trend is less unambiguous .
This is a decrease by two-thirds .
This certainly is an accomplishment that must never be surpassed .
And the big question , of course , is why ?
But let &apos;s look at the good news again .
Take the example of Northern Ireland .
Its initial version was skillfully mediated by Senator George Mitchell .
Central among them , a commitment to exclusively peaceful means .
By no means .
Rather , local leaders committed to revisiting them later on .
A final example : Kosovo .
Central among them are three .
Good news is also about learning the right lesson .
First , leadership .
Second , diplomacy .
Third , institutional design .
Thank you .
Rachel Armstrong : Architecture that repairs itself ?
All buildings today have something in common .
They &apos;re made using Victorian technologies .
All of this effort results in an inert object .
This is not sustainable .
That means we &apos;re generating them from scratch .
And it has no DNA .
It is able to move around its environment .
It can follow chemical gradients .
We don &apos;t know how they do that yet .
Now , this looks like a chemical kind of birth .
This is a violent process .
And that &apos;s the shell around that globular fat .
That can &apos;t be energetically sensible .
So , bottom-up materials actually exist today .
And then they are fossilized over millions of years .
It looks beautiful .
Maybe they could extract carbon dioxide .
Would it give this block of limestone new properties ?
They think big . Okay ?
So , here is the technology we have today .
Now , this is the very interesting part .
We &apos;ve observed this in the laboratory .
The protocells can actually move away from the light .
An accretion itself is a huge sink of carbon dioxide .
Thank you .
Dave Meslin : The antidote to apathy
How often do we hear that people just don &apos;t care ?
And I &apos;ll give you some examples of what I mean .
Let &apos;s start with city hall .
You ever see one of these before ?
This is a newspaper ad .
As you can see , it &apos;s impossible to read .
Now that would never happen .
But that &apos;s not apathy ; that &apos;s intentional exclusion .
Public space .
So you &apos;re never going to see them on a billboard .
This is the cover story .
Then you get to their political articles .
Heroes : How do we view leadership ?
Anyone ?
They all have heroes who were chosen .
A heroic effort is a collective effort , number one .
It &apos;s an ongoing process your whole life .
But most importantly , it &apos;s voluntary .
It &apos;s voluntary .
Political parties : oh boy .
And people can smell that , and it feeds cynicism .
We use out-of-date systems that are unfair and create random results .
It &apos;s like trying to run into a brick wall .
But we can change all those things I mentioned .
We can open up city hall .
We can reform our electoral systems .
We can democratize our public spaces .
Thank you .
Tali Sharot : The optimism bias
We overestimate our longevity , our career prospects .
Take marriage for example .
In the Western world , divorce rates are about 40 percent .
And we all think our kids will be especially talented .
And I &apos;m not alone .
That &apos;s 75 percent .
But private optimism about our own personal future remains persistent .
Now I &apos;m a scientist , I do experiments .
The first one is getting along well with others .
Who here believes they &apos;re at the bottom 25 percent ?
Okay , that &apos;s about 10 people out of 1,500 .
Who believes they &apos;re at the top 25 percent ?
That &apos;s most of us here .
Okay , now do the same for your driving ability .
How interesting are you ?
How attractive are you ?
How honest are you ?
And finally , how modest are you ?
Now this is statistically impossible .
We can &apos;t all be better than everyone else .
And it &apos;s a global phenomenon .
It &apos;s quite widespread .
But the question is , is it good for us ?
So some people say no .
Some people say the secret to happiness is low expectations .
Next time they will do better .
People with low expectations do the opposite .
Next time reality would catch up with them .
So they felt worse .
They were willing to pay extra in order to wait .
But three days seemed to be the optimum amount .
So why is that ?
Anticipation made them happy .
And that anticipation enhances their wellbeing .
They &apos;re actually more realistic than healthy individuals .
But individuals with severe depression , they have a pessimistic bias .
So optimism changes subjective reality .
But it also changes objective reality .
It acts as a self-fulfilling prophecy .
Optimism leads to success in academia and sports and politics .
And maybe the most surprising benefit of optimism is health .
So all in all , optimism has lots of benefits .
But this is not what we find .
So cancer , for example , is about 30 percent .
So they learned quickly and efficiently .
It looks like this .
One of these regions is called the left inferior frontal gyrus .
So we wanted to know , could we change this ?
And there &apos;s a way for us to do that .
This is my collaborator Ryota Kanai .
After that everything goes back to normal , I assure you .
So let &apos;s see what happens .
The key here really is knowledge .
We &apos;re not born with an innate understanding of our biases .
These have to be identified by scientific investigation .
I think this cartoon portrays it nicely .
Thank you .
You just need to look at them a little differently .
This is important because we live in an urban age .
Mayor Bloomberg recognized this when he launched PlaNYC in 2007 .
Not much has changed in those 50 years .
We set out a clear action plan with goals and benchmarks .
It &apos;s not great for parents with kids .
It &apos;s probably not good for the fire hydrants .
Certainly not good for the police department .
It was dangerous , hard to cross the street .
It was chaotic .
And so we did a six-month pilot .
So it was all about the data .
But the results were overwhelming .
Traffic moved better . It was much safer .
Five new flagship stores opened .
It &apos;s been a total home run .
It was like a Star Trek episode , you know ?
They weren &apos;t there before , and then zzzzzt !
All the people arrived .
And the lawn chairs became the talk of the town .
It wasn &apos;t about that we &apos;d closed Broadway to cars .
It was about those lawn chairs .
&quot; What did you think about the lawn chairs ? &quot;
&quot; Do you like the color of the lawn chairs ? &quot;
And the proof is not in a computer model .
It is in the real-world performance of the street .
You can have fun with paint .
I think one of the successes is in its emulation .
And we moved quickly to create an interconnected network of lanes .
You can see the map in 2007 .
I love this because it looks so easy .
You just click it , and they &apos;re there .
We also brought new designs to the street .
We created the first parking-protected bike lane in the United States .
Bike volumes have spiked .
And you can see here that this strategy has worked .
The blue line is the number of cyclists , soaring .
The green line is the number of bike lanes .
And this is what we had done .
Sixty-four percent of New Yorkers support these bike lanes .
People have ridden seven million miles .
That &apos;s 280 times around the globe .
And daily usage just continues to soar .
Yesterday , 40,000 people used Citi Bike in New York City .
The bikes are being used six times a day .
And today , cyclists look like New York City looks .
Quite radical .
You pay at a kiosk before you get on the bus .
It was just fantastic .
And this is how it looked six years ago .
You just need to reimagine your streets .
They &apos;re hidden in plain sight .
Thank you .
Elizabeth Loftus : The fiction of memory
Titus was a restaurant manager .
She said , &quot; That one &apos;s the closest . &quot;
And Titus was convicted .
So what would you do at this point ?
What would you do ?
And really , that &apos;s where this case should have ended .
It should have been over .
It didn &apos;t end that way .
Titus was so bitter .
He lost his fiancée .
She couldn &apos;t put up with his persistent anger .
Well , Titus was consumed with his civil case .
He was 35 years old .
I study memory . I &apos;ve studied memory for decades .
I study false memories .
Well , why ?
Our memories are constructive .
They &apos;re reconstructive .
I first started studying this constructive memory process in the 1970s .
Well out there in the real world , misinformation is everywhere .
You were frightened . You were crying .
Does it affect your later thoughts , your later behaviors ?
The false memories aren &apos;t necessarily bad or unpleasant .
And should we ever ban its use ?
Hello , Santa Claus .
I know what I would choose for a kid of mine .
But maybe my work has made me different from most people .
And I appreciate that . I feel that way too .
We can &apos;t reliably distinguish true memories from false memories .
We need independent corroboration .
Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you .
Thanks very much .
Bruno Bowden + Rufus Cappadocia : Blindfold origami and cello
Hello everyone .
Are you ready to go ? OK .
Just to make it a little bit more exciting .
All right . Take it away , Rufus .
All right . There you go .
Bahia Shehab : A thousand times no
So I decided to look for a thousand different noes .
And I started spraying that on the streets in Cairo .
So I &apos;ll be sharing some of these noes with you .
One month after Mubarak stepped down , this was his reward .
Now , I want to leave you with a final no .
Thank you .
Thank you . Shukran .
Fabian Hemmert : The shape-shifting future of the mobile phone
That &apos;s my question .
The question is : what &apos;s next ?
The first one is mass .
So , could we use that in mobile phones ?
Let me show you the weight-shifting mobile .
We shift the gravitational center of it .
For example , we can augment digital content with physical mass .
So let me show you the shape-changing mobile .
We can play with the shape itself .
It &apos;s like tapered to the downside .
If you change the grasp , it can adjust to that .
It &apos;s fairly simple .
You can &apos;t see it , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
The shape is the second thing .
The third thing operates on a different level .
Think of a hamster in the pocket .
Let me show you the living mobile phone .
And you can tell , it &apos;s relaxed right now .
How do we calm it down ?
Nicholas Christakis : The hidden influence of social networks
And the daughter was exhausted from caring for her mother .
And second , it was not restricted to pairs of people .
Why are we embedded in social networks ?
And how do they effect us ?
So this is a slide of some of our initial results .
It &apos;s 2,200 people in the year 2000 .
But the visual complexity is still very high .
It &apos;s not obvious exactly what &apos;s going on .
Is there more clustering than would be due to chance alone ?
How big are the clusters ? How far do they reach ?
And , most importantly , what causes the clusters ?
On the far left , you see the purple line .
Well , what might be causing this clustering ?
Now , headline writers had a field day with our studies .
Blame your fat friends . &quot;
Our next questions was : Could we actually visualize this spread ?
Lots of people are doing things at the same time .
So , again , every dot is a person .
Every tie between them is a relationship .
And we used a variety of techniques to do this .
And we started exploring all kinds of other phenomena .
And , eventually , we became interested in emotions .
Now , when we have emotions , we show them .
Why do we show our emotions ?
But we don &apos;t just experience them , we show them .
There &apos;s emotional contagion that takes place in human populations .
And , in fact , emotional contagion can be broader still .
Maybe there are emotional stampedes that ripple through social networks .
But they never look like this .
Why do they not look like this ?
But that &apos;s not the case with real networks .
And now I &apos;m highlighting a few dots .
And so , those two individuals have different numbers of friends .
That &apos;s very obvious , we all know that .
This is known as transitivity in networks .
they would say , &quot; I &apos;ve got six friends .
That &apos;s my social experience . &quot;
Would you rather be C or D ?
Now , you would rather be C.
So different structural locations have different implications for your life .
But we also found some non-obvious things .
How does this help us understand ?
They are a kind of social capital .
So think about these two common objects .
Now , look at this .
And what I think the world needs now is more connections .
Thank you .
Anas Aremeyaw Anas : How I named , shamed and jailed
My journey started 14 years ago .
Then I got a scoop .
The scoop was quite a very simple story .
So I decided to go there and act as a seller .
The impact was great .
It was fantastic .
This was what many call immersion journalism , or undercover journalism .
I am an undercover journalist .
Journalism is about results .
They got themselves ready .
I recall how they were seriously boiling the concoction .
As I speak now , they are before the courts .
It was time to go undercover again .
Again , a prosthetic arm was built .
My journalism is about hard core evidence .
My kind of journalism is a product of my society .
So with my hidden intention , I kept quiet .
I didn &apos;t utter a word .
But my colleagues didn &apos;t know .
I &apos;ve never stepped there before .
So I &apos;m surprised .
You see a hand counting money just in front of me .
I have not done any business with anybody .
Anas Aremeyaw Anas : This was another story on anticorruption .
And here was him , denying .
Sometimes these are some of the headlines that come .
AA That was my president .
I have been undercover in the prisons .
I have been there for a long time .
How can you obtain the hard core evidence ?
Toilet facilities : very bad .
Of course , drugs were abundant .
Evil in the society is an extreme disease .
Show me the evidence . &quot;
I say , &quot; This is the evidence . &quot;
This will not stop .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you .
I have some questions for you .
AA Yes , yes .
How do you do that ?
AA You see , undercover is always a last resort .
Before we go undercover , we follow the rules .
I mean , everybody has their hazard .
AA Thank you .
Thank you . Stay safe .
Gabriel Barcia-Colombo : Capturing memories in video art
I love to collect things .
Some people reacted in terror .
You may never experience the entire thing yourself .
By doing that , you are now part of my piece .
But , but this seems a bit unfair , right ?
But I &apos;d never done anything about myself .
I &apos;d never really memorialized myself .
From a teenager , I &apos;m transformed into my current self .
So , in doing so , you &apos;re erasing time .
Thank you .
Josette Sheeran : Ending hunger now
This red cup comes from Rwanda from a child named Fabian .
One out of every seven people .
First , I &apos;ll ask you : Why should you care ?
Why should we care ?
Others worry about peace and security , stability in the world .
The destabilizing effects of hunger are known throughout human history .
Others think about Malthusian nightmares .
This is not a negotiable thing , hunger .
People have to eat .
There &apos;s going to be a lot of people .
But I actually came to this issue in a different way .
This is a picture of me and my three children .
And this was yet another famine in Ethiopia .
One two years earlier had killed more than a million people .
We know how to fix hunger .
A hundred years ago , we didn &apos;t .
We actually have the technology and systems .
And I was just struck that this is out of place .
Well guess what ?
This is last week in northern Kenya .
Their brains and bodies will be stunted .
So this burden of knowledge drives me .
Because actually we know how to fix it very simply .
In Mauritania , less than three percent .
This is something that can be transformed with knowledge .
And this is climate-proof .
The next thing I want to talk about is school feeding .
But when that food is there , it &apos;s transformative .
But what is most amazing is the effect on girls .
We see a transformation in attendance by girls .
And there was no argument , because it &apos;s incentive .
Families need the help .
We know that there &apos;s boom and bust cycles of hunger .
We know this .
So is this a hopeless cause ?
Absolutely not .
You manage , the village manages these warehouses .
So add in five percent , 10 percent more food .
And the food banks are growing .
Food is gold there .
I &apos;d like to talk about what I call digital food .
We certainly saw that in 2008 .
Food can be there and people can &apos;t buy it .
It says &quot; bon appetit &quot; in Arabic .
The shopkeepers are hiring more people .
It is a win-win-win situation that starts the food economy moving .
And Purchasing for Progress today is in 21 countries .
And guess what ?
And we &apos;re seeing people transform their lives .
Now you &apos;d ask , can this be done at scale ?
These are great ideas , village-level ideas .
We have to stand together .
And we &apos;re seeing nations in Africa .
What I would like to offer here is a challenge .
No more are we going to accept this . &quot;
Thank you .
Jamie Oliver : Teach every child about food
My name &apos;s Jamie Oliver . I &apos;m 34 years old .
I use information , education .
We have an awful , awful reality right now .
America , you &apos;re at the top of your game .
This is one of the most unhealthy countries in the world .
Please put your hands up .
Most of you . OK .
Right ?
The statistics of bad health are clear , very clear .
Look at homicide at the bottom , for God &apos;s sake .
Right ?
Any doctor , any specialist will tell you that .
This is a global problem .
It &apos;s a catastrophe .
It &apos;s sweeping the world .
England is right behind you , as usual .
I know they were close , but not that close .
We need a revolution .
Think about smoking .
It costs way less than obesity now .
We need it . The time is now .
We &apos;re in a tipping-point moment .
I &apos;ve been doing this for seven years .
I &apos;ve been trying in America for seven years .
I went to the eye of the storm .
Or it was last year .
Huntington , West Virginia .
Beautiful town .
I want to show a picture of my friend Brittany .
She &apos;s 16 years old .
She has six years to live .
She &apos;s eating her liver to death .
Stacy , the Edwards family .
This is a normal family , guys .
The family &apos;s obese .
Justin here , 12 years old , he &apos;s 350 pounds .
He gets bullied , for God &apos;s sake .
The daughter there , Katie , she &apos;s four years old .
She &apos;s obese before she even gets to primary school .
He &apos;s at the sharp knife-edge of this problem .
He has to bury the people , OK ?
Come winter , three times as many people die .
He &apos;s sick of it .
This is preventable disease . Waste of life .
By the way , this is what they get buried in .
We &apos;re not geared up to do this .
OK , I see it as a triangle , OK ?
This is our landscape of food .
I need you to understand it .
Let &apos;s be frank and honest : Well , modern-day life .
Let &apos;s start with the Main Street .
Supermarkets as well .
Big companies . Big companies .
Portion size is obviously a massive , massive problem .
Labeling is a massive problem .
The labeling in this country is a disgrace .
They want to be self -- they want to self-police themselves .
The industry wants to self-police themselves .
Home .
That ain &apos;t happening anymore .
Jamie Oliver : Let &apos;s have a talk .
How are you feeling ?
Stacy : Just feeling really sad and depressed right now .
But I &apos;m killing them .
JO : Yes you are . You are .
But we can stop that .
OK , school .
OK ?
I &apos;m not slagging them off .
They &apos;re doing the best they can do .
They &apos;re doing their best .
Pizza for breakfast . They don &apos;t even get given crockery .
Knives and forks ? No , they &apos;re too dangerous .
We &apos;re not teaching our kids .
We don &apos;t teach kids about food . Right ?
Who knows what this is ?
Do you know what that is ?
Do you know what that is ? Broccoli ?
JO : What about this ? Our good old friend .
Do you know what this is , honey ? Celery .
JO : Who knows what that is ? Uh , pear ?
JO : Normal . England and America , England and America .
I want to talk about something so basic as milk .
Every kid has the right to milk at school .
They &apos;ll be having two bottles . OK ?
And most kids do .
But milk ain &apos;t good enough anymore .
And obviously now that &apos;s going to catch on .
Do you know what I mean ?
Okay ? There &apos;s sugar in everything .
I know the ins and outs of those ingredients .
There &apos;s our milk . There &apos;s our carton .
So , let me just show you .
You know , there &apos;s your week .
There &apos;s your month .
This , all this bad news , is preventable .
That &apos;s the good news .
It &apos;s very , very preventable .
So , supermarkets .
Where else do you shop so religiously ?
Week in , week out .
This is not expensive .
I know , easier said than done .
It &apos;s the future . It &apos;s the only way .
I know how they do it .
OK , school .
Life skills .
If you can cook , time doesn &apos;t matter .
The workplace , we haven &apos;t really talked about it .
The staff are the moms and dads of America &apos;s children .
Definitely they shouldn &apos;t be left out .
Let &apos;s go back to the home .
Absolutely .
For sure , pass it on as a philosophy .
We &apos;ve got to put back what &apos;s been lost .
I truly believe that change will happen .
Huntington &apos;s Kitchen . I work with a community .
That &apos;s all it takes , six-and-a-half grand per school .
The Kitchen is 25 grand a month . Okay ?
You know , it &apos;s local cooks teaching local people .
This is real , tangible change , real , tangible change .
It &apos;s incredibly important .
I &apos;m here .
So , my wish .
Dyslexic , so I &apos;m a bit slow .
Thank you .
Jennifer Healey : If cars could talk , accidents might be avoidable
Let &apos;s face it : Driving is dangerous .
So what happens ?
I step on the brake .
But no , this guy isn &apos;t slowing down .
It was just going 65 -- to zero ?
I slammed on the brakes .
You can &apos;t really directly sense the world around you .
You &apos;re in this extended body .
Take your eyes off the road . That &apos;s right .
What &apos;s more important ?
But occasionally we miss something .
Occasionally we sense something wrong or too late .
And I believe that . I believe that .
We can only watch so much .
But the technology exists now that can help us improve that .
You may think that &apos;s impossible .
How can you predict the future ? That &apos;s really hard .
Actually , no . With cars , it &apos;s not impossible .
Cars are three-dimensional objects that have a fixed position and velocity .
They travel down roads .
Often they travel on pre-published routes .
Right ? I mean , somebody &apos;s seen him .
You can make reasonable predictions about how cars behave .
I mean , they &apos;re Newtonian objects .
That &apos;s very nice about them .
So how do we get there ?
And same with the other cars .
I can tell you exactly what happens .
Both models improve .
Everybody wins .
That guy could be a problem .
And you can predict the new trajectory .
Fundamentally , these technologies exist today .
I believe our cars can talk about us behind our backs .
And I think it &apos;s going to be a great thing .
So let your car gossip about you .
It &apos;s going to make the roads a lot safer .
Thank you .
Tim Harford : Trial , error and the God complex
It &apos;s the Second World War .
A German prison camp .
He doesn &apos;t know how to cure it .
And he &apos;s operating in a hostile environment .
And people do terrible things in wars .
The German camp guards , they &apos;ve got bored .
He said he heard suspicious laughter .
So the situation seemed pretty desperate .
But Archie Cochrane was a resourceful person .
Now some of you will be wondering what marmite is .
Marmite is a breakfast spread beloved of the British .
It looks like crude oil .
It tastes ...
zesty .
And importantly , it &apos;s a rich source of vitamin B12 .
He gives half of them vitamin C.
He gives half of them vitamin B12 .
And he had a name for it .
He called it the God complex .
And doctors suffer from the God complex a lot .
I see it in our business leaders .
Well let me give you an example .
You know Hans : the Mick Jagger of TED .
And they are brilliant ; it &apos;s wonderful work .
Three pieces of data is nothing .
I mean , have a look at this graph .
This is produced by the physicist Cesar Hidalgo .
He &apos;s at MIT .
And it &apos;s wonderful , wonderful work .
You show all these interconnections , all these interrelations .
Brilliant work .
Five thousand products -- that &apos;s still nothing .
Imagine you had one second per product category .
There are 100,000 there . It would take you all day .
This is how complex the economy we &apos;ve created is .
And I &apos;m just counting toasters here .
I &apos;m not trying to solve the Middle East problem .
The complexity here is unbelievable .
You could count them in five minutes .
So this is the complexity of the world that surrounds us .
This perhaps is why we find the God complex so tempting .
And we don &apos;t .
We never do .
Now I &apos;m not trying to deliver a nihilistic message here .
We clearly can .
And we have a problem-solving technique that works .
Here &apos;s an example .
This baby was produced through trial and error .
I realize that &apos;s an ambiguous statement .
Maybe I should clarify it .
This baby is a human body : it evolved .
What is evolution ?
You could use it in an industrial context .
So let &apos;s say you wanted to make detergent .
How do you do it ?
Well you have this great big tank full of liquid detergent .
You pump it at a high pressure through a nozzle .
You create a spray of detergent .
Then the spray dries . It turns into powder .
It falls to the floor .
You scoop it up . You put it in cardboard boxes .
You sell it at a supermarket .
You make lots of money .
How do you design that nozzle ?
It turns out to be very important .
Even this problem , too complicated .
You create 10 variations on that one .
You try out 10 variations on that one .
You see how this works , right ?
And after 45 generations , you have this incredible nozzle .
And we &apos;ve heard a lot about how economies function .
The U.S. economy is still the world &apos;s greatest economy .
How did it become the world &apos;s greatest economy ?
That is a huge failure rate .
Ten percent of Americans don &apos;t disappear every year .
I sometimes wonder .
It &apos;s come through trial and error .
Obviously trial and error is very important .
Obviously experimentation is very important .
So I say , okay , fine .
You think it &apos;s obvious ?
I want to fix our education system .
I have no idea how to do it .
I have half a dozen ideas .
Then we &apos;ll test some other ideas out .
Because it &apos;s so hard to admit our own fallibility .
It &apos;s so uncomfortable .
And Archie Cochrane understood this as well as anybody .
All the cardiac doctors tried to shut him down .
They had the God complex in spades .
Nevertheless , Archie managed to get permission to do this .
He ran his trial .
They &apos;re not statistically significant .
But we have something .
They should be in hospital . &quot;
Shut it down at once . &quot;
And there &apos;s this huge hubbub .
Archie lets it die down .
Tumbleweed rolls through the meeting room .
But Cochrane would do that kind of thing .
I do not want to have my opinions challenged .
I do not want to have my conclusions tested . &quot;
And you sometimes need to be shocked out of that .
Now I &apos;m not going to pretend that this is easy .
It isn &apos;t easy .
It &apos;s incredibly painful .
You prove one , you prove the other .
But it was always a conjecture .
He made a lot of mistakes .
But he made mistakes in a good direction .
Thank you .
Jarrett J. Krosoczka : How a boy became an artist
So I use my imagination as my full-time job .
He ran and worked in a factory .
My grandmother was a homemaker .
An author visited our school , Jack Gantos .
And he wandered away .
Two words that made a colossal difference in my life .
Yeah .
My book had a title page .
My favorite page is the &quot; About the author &quot; page .
And so these characters would become my friends .
I had art .
And I was so thrilled .
Don &apos;t tempt me , because I will do it .
And I just flourished here .
So how did I make friends ?
Mr. Greenwood was not pleased .
My grandfather &apos;s just going to kill me . &quot;
Just stop drawing in my class . &quot;
So my parents never found out about it .
Now I never really asked my grandparents for anything .
And a video camera .
I just wanted a video camera .
And I kept making comics .
The kid had no patience for him .
I set up a studio and I tried to get published .
But I know it &apos;s going to happen . &quot;
And I sent out one last batch of postcards .
&quot; Dear Jarrett , I received your postcard .
And my local paper celebrated the news .
The local bookstore made a big deal of it .
They sold out of all of their books .
My grandparents , they were in the middle of it .
And then something happened that changed my life .
For a two-year-old , that is like a tattoo .
You know ? You only get one birthday per year .
And for him , it &apos;s only his second .
I have 10 picture books out .
And I meet Bagheads .
Lunch ladies treat me really well .
I said , &quot; Mrs. Alisch , how are you ? &quot;
And she responded with , &quot; I &apos;m here . &quot;
Thank you .
David Kelley : How to build your creative confidence
I wanted to talk to you today about creative confidence .
And Brian &apos;s shoulders sank .
I never saw Brian do a project like that ever again .
And I wonder how often that happens .
So we see a lot of this .
And they &apos;re just so uncomfortable .
But we know that &apos;s not true .
I don &apos;t know if you know Albert Bandura .
Bandura &apos;s 86 and he still works at Stanford .
And he &apos;s just a lovely guy .
We talked about snakes and fear of snakes as a phobia .
And it was really enjoyable , really interesting .
But Bandura has a step-by-step process that was super successful .
And he &apos;d get them comfortable with that .
In fact , everything was better than fine .
And they were holding it in their laps .
Bandura calls this process &quot; guided mastery . &quot;
I love that term : guided mastery .
They just gained a new confidence .
That transformation is amazing .
We see it at the d.school all the time .
To me , that journey looks like Doug Dietz .
Doug Dietz is a technical person .
He designs medical imaging equipment , large medical imaging equipment .
But at one point he had a moment of crisis .
He was saving lives with this machine .
He would redesign the entire experience of being scanned .
And this is what he came up with .
He turned it into an adventure for the kids .
And now when the kid comes , it &apos;s an experience .
And the results were super dramatic .
And the hospital and GE were happy too .
So the quantitative results were great .
Doug &apos;s story takes place in a hospital .
I know a thing or two about hospitals .
It was cancer . It was the bad kind .
I was told I had a 40 percent chance of survival .
Mostly you think about , Am I going to survive ?
But you think about other things .
What was my calling ? What should I do ?
And I was lucky because I had lots of options .
I survived , just so you know .
And they just make better decisions .
Everybody has a change-the-world thing .
And those natural people should let their ideas fly .
Thank you .
Julia Sweeney : It &apos;s time for &quot; The Talk &quot;
I have a daughter , Mulan .
And then they become tadpoles and frogs . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
And she goes , &quot; And what &apos;s this fertilizing ? &quot;
And I thought , &quot; Okay , here we go . &quot;
Don &apos;t give any more information . &quot;
So I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Well , funny you should ask .
We have evolved to have our own pond .
We have our very own pond inside our bodies .
And you go through the woman &apos;s vagina . &quot;
Like , where you go to the bathroom ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; I know .
I know . &quot;
That &apos;s how we evolved . It does seem odd .
Bad zoning , but ... &quot;
So how could that ever happen ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
And I said , &quot; ... &quot;
Like , how do they know that &apos;s the time ?
&quot; That is exactly right .
That &apos;s exactly how it happens . &quot;
Oh ... &quot;
Would that ever happen ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Oh , no , no .
That &apos;s not how we do it . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand the legs . &quot;
She goes , &quot; What about dogs ? &quot;
That would never happen . &quot;
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you . I &apos;m so happy to be here .
Andrew McAfee : Are droids taking our jobs ?
And there &apos;s some evidence that they are .
So the businesses are getting out their checkbooks .
What they &apos;re not really doing is hiring .
But the story is not just a recession story .
It was written by an algorithm .
And it &apos;s not decent , it &apos;s perfect .
And digital technologies are not just impacting knowledge work .
They haven &apos;t done a darn thing to the curves .
Let me give you a couple examples .
And I want to say to that very clearly : nonsense .
The bottom of the pyramid is benefiting hugely from technology .
Prices stabilized , so people could plan their economic lives .
Waste was not reduced ; it was eliminated .
Thanks very much .
Kelli Swazey : Life that doesn &apos;t end with death
And that &apos;s exactly what I &apos;m saying .
These are called tau tau .
So the funeral ceremony itself embodies this relational perspective on death .
It ritualizes the impact of death on families and communities .
And it &apos;s also a moment of self-awareness .
It &apos;s called the sunga &apos; .
And his death will be greatly mourned .
His story is their story .
His funeral songs will sing them a song about themselves .
Lisa Gansky : The future of business is the &quot; mesh &quot;
And we come from a long tradition of sharing .
We &apos;ve shared transportation .
Secondly , population growth and density into cities .
More people , smaller spaces , less stuff .
It allows us to engage in really new and interesting ways .
For example , I want to use Zipcar .
How many people here have experienced car-sharing or bike-sharing ?
Wow , that &apos;s great . Okay , thank you .
Basically Zipcar is the largest car-sharing company in the world .
They did not invent car-sharing .
Car-sharing was actually invented in Europe .
Zipcar got some really important things right .
They made it sexy . They made it fresh .
They made it aspirational .
They picked these sexy cars .
They targeted to universities .
But they understood fundamentally that they are not a car company .
They understand that they are an information company .
What percentage of the time ?
Any guesses ?
Those are really very good .
The number across the U.S. and Western Europe is eight percent .
What set up with Zipcar -- Zipcar started in 2000 .
So people have created this business .
Zipcar started a decade earlier , in 2000 .
It took them six years to get 1,000 cars in service .
So , really interesting .
So it &apos;s like vacation rentals for cars .
Because it just creates more flexibility .
It allows us as owners to have other options .
And I think we &apos;re going there anyway .
It &apos;s contagious because we &apos;re all connected to each other .
Platforms are invitations .
And honestly , it &apos;s full of surprises .
Now we &apos;re saying that there &apos;s other options as well .
Google has made available transit data API .
That space is not vital .
The areas around it lack vitality and vibrancy and engagement .
And this is a very mesh-y thing .
Super fun , and it happens in a very transitional neighborhood .
So this is an example .
But these sorts of things are happening in many different environments .
It &apos;s very cost-effective , and it &apos;s very mesh-y .
The infrastructure enables that .
They made a lot of mistakes .
They had some number of big successes .
And it grows on a very regular daily basis .
But it &apos;s very much at the beginning .
And thank you very much .
Shaffi Mather : A new way to fight corruption
Since then I &apos;ve also co-founded two other social enterprises .
Corruption , bribes , and lack of transparency .
Now , let me ask you another question .
Most definitely you don &apos;t want to pay the bribe .
Such a service simply do not exist .
The target market is as tempting as it can get .
And it is an absolutely virgin market .
It never has been and it never will be .
What gives us the courage ?
Shaffi , that is a really exciting business idea .
What &apos;s on your mind ?
Somebody who had applied for the passport .
And he did not want to pay .
And he will push us back .
So , it actually works .
That &apos;s a high gross margin business . I like it .
OK , so these are provisional numbers , no pricing guarantee .
I mean , this could be huge .
Thank you so much for sharing this idea at TED .
Iwan Baan : Ingenious homes in unexpected places
In the lobby , they painted the walls and planted trees .
They also made a basketball court .
With no elevators , the tower is like a 45-story walkup .
And you even find a church .
In Makoko , very few systems and infrastructures exist .
Visiting the homes of the Zabbaleen is also full of surprises .
These dwellings are called the yaodongs .
Thank you .
Ray Zahab : My trek to the South Pole
We shaved five days off the previous best time .
It &apos;s going to be 40 below , every single day .
You &apos;ll be in a massive headwind .
The punchline to your journey ? Look at the horizon .
It began a little less than two years ago .
Young people would ask the most amazing questions .
They were our teammates ! They were inspiring us .
The stories we were hearing got us to the South Pole .
The website worked brilliantly as a two-way street of communication .
That I &apos;m this uber-endurance guy ?
I &apos;m learning this at 40 .
Can you imagine ? Seriously , can you imagine ?
I &apos;m learning this at 40 years of age .
Thank you very much . Thank you .
Caroline Lavelle : Casting a spell on the cello
Thank you very much .
Now , I &apos;ve got a story for you .
And I said , &quot; Do you really ? &quot;
This song is called &quot; Farther than the Sun . &quot;
Mitch Resnick : Let &apos;s teach kids to code
So I started taking a look at them .
And the creator very considerately offered a replay for her mom .
What do I mean by fluent ?
And it &apos;s similar with new technologies .
But actually I &apos;m sort of skeptical about this term .
But that doesn &apos;t really make you fluent .
It seems that everybody is getting into the act .
And that triggered a debate in the U.K.
about whether all the children there should learn to code .
But coding doesn &apos;t have to be like this .
And it doesn &apos;t just stay on the screen .
Here &apos;s an example .
It uses the webcam .
Here &apos;s an example of a project using the microphone .
And it &apos;s the same thing with coding .
If you learn to code , you can code to learn .
You learn more about how computers work .
But that &apos;s just where it starts .
Let me show you an example .
He wanted to keep score .
So I showed him .
In Scratch , you can create something called a variable .
I &apos;ll call it score .
And it &apos;s in fact working .
Now he had a reason for learning variables .
They &apos;re relevant for all sorts of different activities .
Very few people become professional writers .
Again , the same thing with coding .
And it &apos;s not just about your work life .
Let me end with just one more example .
It &apos;s scratch.mit.edu , and give a try at coding .
Thanks very much .
Adora Svitak : What adults can learn from kids
Which really bothers me .
Ask yourself , who &apos;s responsible ? Adults .
Now , what have kids done ?
Thank you .
Kids can be full of inspiring aspirations and hopeful thinking .
On the other hand , we kids still dream about perfection .
I think that adults should start learning from kids .
The students should teach their teachers .
Learning between grown ups and kids should be reciprocal .
True story , by the way .
Thank you Bill Gates and thank you Ma .
Kids grow up and become adults just like you .
Or just like you ? Really ?
Kids need opportunities to lead and succeed .
Are you ready to make the match ?
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
Jonathan Haidt : Religion , evolution , and the ecstasy of self-transcendence
I have a question for you : Are you religious ?
Okay , that &apos;s the majority .
My Talk today is about self-transcendence .
We talk about being uplifted or elevated .
So here &apos;s the metaphor I &apos;m offering today .
We climb the staircase and experience a state of altered consciousness .
He collected all kinds of case studies .
And here &apos;s what Bradley said about it .
The next day I rejoiced with trembling .
This world had no place in my affections .
Previous to this time , I was very selfish and self-righteous .
And on this higher level he becomes loving and forgiving .
Some shut down the self using meditation .
Others use psychedelic drugs .
Others use dancing , spinning and circling to promote self-transcendence .
Lots of people find self-transcendence in nature .
Others overcome their self at raves .
But here &apos;s the weirdest place of all : war .
Here &apos;s a key passage where he basically describes the staircase .
It feels somehow uplifting .
Durkheim even called us Homo duplex , or two-level man .
The lower level he called the level of the profane .
Now profane is the opposite of sacred .
It just means ordinary or common .
And in our ordinary lives we exist as individuals .
We want to satisfy our individual desires .
We pursue our individual goals .
But sometimes something happens that triggers a phase change .
So let me summarize where we are .
I &apos;m offering the metaphor of a staircase in the mind .
Is it a product of natural selection , like our hands ?
Well many scientists who study religion take this view .
Well let me show you .
In other words , Charles Darwin believed in group selection .
Within this team there &apos;s competition .
There are guys competing with each other .
Maybe one of them will make it to the Olympics .
Maybe he &apos;ll badmouth his chief rival to the coach .
Let me illustrate this for you .
But suppose then that one of them mutates .
It takes advantage of the others .
So here &apos;s how things play out .
And in short order , the cooperators are done for .
The free-riders have taken over .
But there are solutions to the free-rider problem .
It &apos;s not that hard a problem .
In fact , nature has solved it many , many times .
A superorganism can basically take what it wants .
And the most cohesive hives won , just as Darwin said .
Do you think they &apos;re there pursuing their self-interest ?
We are Homo duplex , as Durkheim explained .
Those things came along too recently .
This is why politics is so tribal .
It &apos;s about joining with others to pursue moral ideas .
We unleashed Earth-changing creativity and generated vast wealth and comfort .
Nowadays we fly around like individual bees exulting in our freedom .
But sometimes we wonder : Is this all there is ?
What should I do with my life ?
What &apos;s missing ?
It &apos;s really comfortable down here on the lower level .
Come , have a seat in my home entertainment center .
They &apos;re all searching for their staircase .
And that gives me hope because people are not purely selfish .
&quot; No man is an island entire of itself .
JH : Thank you .
Cynthia Kenyon : Experiments that hint of longer lives
This is a dream of the ages .
because they have different genes .
And we didn &apos;t study any of these animals .
It &apos;s quite a cute little fellow .
So this animal is going to live twice as long .
Is it miserable ? It doesn &apos;t seem to be .
It &apos;s active . You can &apos;t tell the difference really .
Now get out your handkerchiefs here .
But everything else is just lying there .
The animal &apos;s clearly in the nursing home .
So there &apos;s something about aging that &apos;s kind of universal .
And now here is the daf-2 mutant .
She says , &quot; I &apos;m 60 . &quot;
You would never know , until she told you .
Okay .
So what is the daf-2 gene ?
And the daf-2 gene encodes a hormone receptor .
So part of it is like a baseball glove .
That &apos;s what that arrow means .
It speeds up aging . It makes it go faster .
So this is altogether really , really interesting .
So what kind of hormones are these ?
There &apos;s lots of hormones . There &apos;s testosterone , adrenalin .
You know about a lot of them .
Now you &apos;ve all heard of at least insulin .
And the hormone IGF-1 promotes growth .
And it &apos;s looking like that &apos;s the case .
And that is the case in flies .
And also in mice -- and mice are mammals like us .
And also , the common precursor also gave rise to people .
So maybe it &apos;s working in people the same way .
And there are hints of this .
It damaged the gene .
So how can a hormone ultimately affect the rate of aging ?
How could that work ?
The receptor isn &apos;t working as well .
And it &apos;s just sitting on one of them .
So FOXO turns on a lot of genes .
DNA repair genes are more active in these animals .
And the immune system is more active .
So it &apos;s really interesting .
So what about the normal worm ?
So it can &apos;t turn the genes on .
But what good is this for the worm ?
Then they promote the uptake of nutrients .
And that &apos;s why we think the animals live longer .
But it &apos;s deteriorating .
So he doesn &apos;t actually do anything himself .
And they all come and they fortify the house .
So this is really exciting to me .
And I &apos;m really optimistic that this is going to work .
So people take it to prevent organ transplants from being rejected .
Thank you .
Matt Ridley : Thank you , Cynthia .
Let me get this straight .
You could change the genes in principle .
There isn &apos;t the technology to do that .
But I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
Just move to one side for us , if you would .
For example , there are some tortoises called Blanding &apos;s turtles .
And they grow to be about this size .
It &apos;s not clear .
And our long-lived mutants are too .
They &apos;re more resistant to these kinds of stresses .
Yes , that &apos;s right .
They &apos;re not getting old in the dog &apos;s lifespan .
It &apos;s more like that .
MR : Thank you very much indeed , Cynthia Kenyon .
Dan Phillips : Creative houses from reclaimed stuff
Thank you very much .
It was all just gone .
This is the first house I built .
Have a little turret there .
And then these buttons on the corbels here .
Right there -- those are hickory nuts .
And these buttons there -- those are chicken eggs .
Then , this is a look at the inside .
Even the lockset is probably worth 200 dollars .
Everything in the kitchen was salvaged .
This is going up into the turret .
And those are those cast-iron things you see at antique shops .
If not , it goes into the toilet .
It &apos;s a two-person tub .
Then , this is a house based on a Budweiser can .
That &apos;ll keep bull elephants out , I promise .
The shower is intended to simulate a glass of beer .
And then the faucet , there , is a beer tap .
It &apos;s a pretty panel of glass .
So don &apos;t put it there .
Then , another bathroom upstairs .
Don &apos;t put it in the foyer .
What does that mean ?
Oh , that &apos;s a cell phone .
But you &apos;ve never seen this one before .
Oh , that &apos;s a cell phone .
That &apos;s not a cell phone .
That &apos;s one of those new chocolate cell phones . &quot;
That &apos;s how we process information .
Because that &apos;s what you do with a cracked pane .
Never mind that it doesn &apos;t affect our lives at all .
It only rattles that expected pattern and unity of structural features .
We &apos;ll go , &quot; Ooh , that &apos;s nice . &quot;
So , that serves me every day .
Repetition creates pattern .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference .
That causes a lot of waste in the building industry .
Predicated on plumb level , square and centered .
The Dionysian personality takes the picture and goes ...
That &apos;s the difference .
I feature blemish .
I feature organic process .
Dead-center John Dewey .
Apollonian mindset creates mountains of waste .
&quot; Oops , scratch , dumpster . &quot;
So now we have standardized materials .
We create mountains of waste .
The fourth thing is labor is disproportionately more expensive than materials .
Well , that &apos;s just a myth .
So we hired on .
Do the math . &quot;
And that &apos;s what happened there .
The problem is we can &apos;t afford it .
Now there &apos;s a blight on the planet .
You write the check , and instantly it depreciates 30 percent .
Wired with 14-gauge wire typically .
Are we just being numbingly stupid ?
The walls are this thick .
The whole thing has the structural value of corn .
&quot; So I thought Palm Harbor Village was over there . &quot;
&quot; No , no . We had a wind last night .
It &apos;s gone now . &quot;
Then when they degrade , what do you do with them ?
Then here come the marketeers and the advertisers .
&quot; Woo . Woohooo . &quot;
We buy stuff we didn &apos;t know we needed .
How disgusting .
My oh my , that makes it worse .
And we get sucked into that faster than anything .
It &apos;s a pretty quick read .
In there he talked about the divided self .
That happens in the building industry as well .
That &apos;s why all of our subdivisions look the same .
Sometimes we even have these formalized cultural expectations .
I &apos;ll bet all your shoes match .
Sometimes those guys are Nazis , my oh my .
That exacerbates and continues this model .
The last thing is gregariousness .
Human beings are a social species .
Wildebeests don &apos;t hang with lions because lions eat wildebeests .
Human beings are like that .
And so you see this in junior high a lot .
See , look , don &apos;t touch my designer jeans .
I see you don &apos;t have designer jeans .
You &apos;re not one of the beautiful people .
Right there is reason enough to have uniforms .
And so that happens in the building industry as well .
Second , security . Third , relationships .
Fourth , status , self-esteem -- that is , vanity .
And we &apos;re taking vanity and shoving it down here .
We can &apos;t even afford to eat anything except beans .
That is , our housing has become a commodity .
But that &apos;s okay .
If failure destroys you , then you can &apos;t do this .
What a moron . &quot;
We &apos;re in trouble .
What do you think , honey ? &quot;
If it doesn &apos;t work , take it down .
Thank you very much .
Jay Walker : My library of human imagination
This is not a copy .
They would bring them back and mount them .
So this has actually been carried to the moon and back .
So that &apos;s for fun .
The dawn of books is , of course , important .
You see , the book was not driven by reading .
In 1455 , nobody could read .
So why did the printing press succeed ?
This is an original page of a Guttenberg Bible .
They got you out of purgatory faster .
We &apos;re going to have some tomorrow .
This is the Library of Human Imagination .
The room itself is three stories tall .
The room is a theatre . It changes colors .
And all throughout the library are different objects , different spaces .
It &apos;s designed like an Escher print .
You can walk through . You can touch .
There &apos;s my very own Saturn V.
Everybody should have one , OK ?
So it &apos;s a leap of imagination .
How do we create ?
TED is all about patterns in the clouds .
It &apos;s all about connections .
And that &apos;s really what discovery and imagination is all about .
These two molecules code and decode .
And they &apos;re connected primarily because of this here .
You see , this is a human brain model , OK ?
We get to see a skull . But there it is .
And I &apos;ll give you a quick example .
And we never think about the hidden connection .
Thanks , Chris .
Ali Carr-Chellman : Gaming to re-engage boys in learning
How do we know that ?
The Hundred Girls Project tells us some really nice statistics .
Now there is another side to this .
That &apos;s all true .
And so we should .
Guess what ?
Video games are not the cause .
Video games are a symptom .
They were turned off a long time before they got here .
The first is zero tolerance .
I mean , really .
Now I &apos;m not advocating for bullies .
&quot; Okay , what is she telling you to write ? &quot;
&quot; Poems . I have to write poems .
And little moments in my life .
I don &apos;t want to write that stuff . &quot;
I want to write about this really interesting world .
&quot; All right . Okay . &quot;
And the answer is no , he &apos;s just a boy .
He &apos;s just a little boy .
We went from 14 percent to seven percent .
Now what &apos;s the problem with this ?
Women are great . Yep , absolutely .
This is a place for girls .
Men don &apos;t belong here , that &apos;s pretty obvious .
&quot; What are we going to do with these boys ? &quot;
Are there men around that table ?
Are there moms who &apos;ve raised boys around that table ?
We have a serious compression of the curriculum happening out there .
This compressed curriculum is bad for all active kids .
That &apos;s what she tells them .
Indirectly , that &apos;s what she tells them .
It &apos;s coming from us .
Have you seen the ads ?
So what do we do ?
We need to meet them where they are .
We need to put ourselves into boy culture .
More specifically , we can do some very specific things .
We can design better games .
They &apos;re glorified drill and practice .
So we need to design better games .
We need to look carefully at our zero tolerance policies .
Do they make sense ?
All of those conversations need to be happening .
We need to find more money for game design .
Most of the educational games do not .
And they &apos;re always talking about this stuff . &quot;
And they say these things as if it &apos;s okay .
They are sure that parents and administrators will never accept anything .
It wasn &apos;t for me .
Thank you .
Heather Knight : Silicon-based comedy
So we &apos;re based in New York City .
He &apos;s named after the Star Trek character .
I think he &apos;s going to be super popular .
Now each of these jokes is labeled with certain attributes .
It knows how much it &apos;s moving .
And so it &apos;s going to try to watch your response .
If you like what &apos;s going on , show the green .
Now don &apos;t be shy .
It &apos;s just a robot .
It doesn &apos;t have feelings ... yet .
Right , so , let the robot stand-up comedy begin .
Data : Hello TEDWomen .
It &apos;s an honor to be here .
You guys are looking good out there .
Ready for some jokes ?
Data : Here &apos;s the first one .
&quot; That &apos;s terrible , &quot; said the patient .
&quot; How can the news possibly be worse ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve been trying to contact you since yesterday . &quot;
Heather Knight : He &apos;s talking about the Swiss .
Data : Pretty lucky for them .
HK : He &apos;s a French robot .
One of them falls to the ground .
He does not seem to be breathing .
The other guy whips out his cell phone and calls 911 .
He gasps to the operator , &quot; My friend is dead .
What can I do ? &quot;
The operator says , &quot; Just take it easy .
I can help .
First , let &apos;s make sure he &apos;s dead . &quot;
There is a silence , and the operator hears a shot .
Question : Why is television called a medium ?
Anyone ?
Because it &apos;s neither rare nor well done .
Any of you like television ? Audience : Yes .
Data : I find it incredibly educational .
That &apos;s all for now .
Was that okay for my first time ?
You &apos;ve been a great audience .
Thank you .
HK : Yay .
So thank you all for being a part of it .
There &apos;s a lot more to come .
And we hope to learn a lot about robot expression .
Thank you very much .
TED &apos;s nonprofit transition
So , I &apos;m just going to grab a chair here .
And all this had come from nothing .
The date was February 2000 .
And it was gut wrenching .
The theme next year is re-birth .
It &apos;s connected ; it all hooks into each other .
And she answered , &quot; A penis . &quot;
Turns out that the research done on that is absolutely mind-blowing .
Are we the victims of a mass delusion ?
And so on , and so on .
It &apos;s the total brain experience , we &apos;re going to ...
it &apos;s the mental equivalent of the full body massage .
Every mental organ addressed . It really is .
So , I will . Here &apos;s the vision for TED .
That &apos;s not going to be changed at all .
It &apos;s true .
I think it will be great .
I &apos;m incredibly excited about that .
Carolyn Porco : Could a Saturn moon harbor life ?
So we are very encouraged by these results .
Thank you .
Stefan Sagmeister : 7 rules for making more happiness
The serif is not really in place .
That climate plays no role .
Black people are just as happy as white people are .
You will adapt to it and get used to it .
If you have manageable health problems it doesn &apos;t really matter .
Now this does matter .
We become what we really are interested in .
They get influenced by things that they &apos;re not aware of .
This is just completely ridiculous . &quot;
So I am looking still for a Stephanie .
I &apos;ll figure something out .
One of them is to think without pressure .
But also because the content was very close .
Thank you so much .
Sean Gourley : The mathematics of war
Can you get me some information ?
No . So I had to think a little harder .
And I was watching the news one night in Oxford .
And I saw that there was information there .
There was data within the streams of news that we consume .
All this noise around us actually has information .
We did it in three steps .
We brought this raw data in and we filtered it .
We extracted the key bits on information to build the database .
What would that tell us ?
So we plot data for sample on this .
We did this exact same thing for Iraq .
It turns out what we found was pretty surprising .
This blew our mind .
Why should there be order in war ?
We didn &apos;t really understand that .
We thought maybe there is something special about Iraq .
So we looked at a few more conflicts .
And the same pattern emerged in each conflict .
This wasn &apos;t supposed to happen .
And yet the fundamental patterns underlying them are the same .
So we went a little wider .
From Peru to Indonesia , we studied this same pattern again .
So what ?
That was a challenge we had to face as physicists .
How do we explain this ?
Turns out we kind of do a reasonable job .
We can run these simulations .
So what &apos;s going on ?
And that is what we think is happening .
Taking it forward , how do we change it ?
How do we end a war like Iraq ?
What does it look like ?
This is what wars look like when they continue .
We &apos;ve got to change that .
And we see the evolution of Alpha through time .
This is when the surge happens .
The opposite happened .
The groups became stronger .
They became more robust .
It &apos;s moved up again . The groups are more fragmented .
And this tells me one of two things .
I don &apos;t know what the answer is to that .
Thank you .
Ryan Merkley : Online video -- annotated , remixed and popped
To understand the world that live in , we tell stories .
Popcorn changes all of that .
Hi , and welcome to my newscast .
Let &apos;s set it to something else .
Now here are live images being pulled straight from the feed .
Thank you .
Kiran Sethi : Kids , take charge
Contagious is a good word .
Even in the times of H1N1 , I like the word .
Laughter is contagious . Passion is contagious .
Inspiration is contagious .
We &apos;ve heard some remarkable stories from some remarkable speakers .
So , the question is , why only them ?
Is it luck ? Is it chance ?
Can we all not systematically and consciously get infected ?
And that directly increased student wellbeing .
Children became more competent , and less helpless .
But this was all common sense .
That &apos;s them rolling .
And that can &apos;t happen in a classroom .
And it is a process that can be energized and nurtured .
Show us the grades . &quot;
And we did . The data was conclusive .
Now it was not about Riverside school .
It was about all children . So , we were shameless .
When will you include the child in the city ?
So , how did the city respond ?
A glimpse of infection in Ahmedabad .
&#91; Unclear &#93; So , the busiest streets closed down .
We have the traffic police and municipal corporation helping us .
It gets taken over by children .
They are skating . They are doing street plays .
They are playing , all free , for all children .
Kiran Bir Sethi : And the city will give free time .
And Ahmedabad got the first child-friendly zebra crossing in the world .
Then 30,000 children in Ahmedabad , and growing .
It was time now to infect India .
We basically gave children a very simple challenge .
Children were designing solutions for a diverse range of problems .
I mean , it was incredible .
Infection in India .
This is in Rajasthan , a rural village .
Look at what their parents says .
This program is wonderful .
I am so happy that my students did this campaign .
See ? They have done it .
K An inner city school in Hyderabad .
Girl : 581 . This house is 581 ...
We have to start collecting from 555 .
Girl : Thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
Are you ready , ladies and gentlemen ? Audience : Yes !
Girl : Are you ready ? Audience : Yes !
Girl : Are you ready ? Audience : Yes !
K So , the charter of compassion starts right here .
Street plays , auctions , petitions .
I mean , they were changing lives .
It was incredible .
So , how can we still stay immune ?
So , if not us , then who ?
If not now , then when ?
Like I said , contagious is a good word .
Thank you .
Juliana Rotich : Meet BRCK , Internet access built for Africa
And now we &apos;ve got the digital revolution .
These revolutions have not been evenly distributed across continents and nations .
Never have been .
The connectivity situation has improved greatly , but some barriers remain .
It is with this context that Ushahidi came to be .
So we came together and we created software called Ushahidi .
I &apos;m very lucky to work with two amazing collaborators .
This is David and Erik .
I call them brothers from another mother .
Clearly I have a German mother somewhere .
And we worked together first with building and growing Ushahidi .
Ushahidi is not only the software that we made .
I moved back to Kenya in 2011 .
Erik moved in 2010 .
I had never had to deal with a blackout .
Blackouts are not fun .
This is the reality that we deal with .
Could we leverage the cloud ?
We &apos;ve built a crowd map , we &apos;ve built Ushahidi .
What if we could have connectivity with less friction ?
This is the BRCK .
Mobile connectivity in Africa is pervasive .
It &apos;s actually everywhere .
Most towns at least have a 3G connection .
With load balancing , this can be possible .
Imagine a weather station that can be attached to this .
It is not without challenge .
&quot; What are you carrying ? &quot;
Thank you .
Salman Khan : Let &apos;s use video to reinvent education
Start differentiating into effector and memory cells .
A galaxy . Hey , there &apos;s another galaxy .
Oh look , there &apos;s another galaxy .
The first was the feedback from my cousins .
And these are just a few .
This is actually from one of the original calculus videos .
And let &apos;s pause here .
This person did a derivative and then they smiled .
This clearly was helping people .
This is just an excerpt from one of those letters .
We have tried everything , viewed everything , bought everything .
We stumbled on your video on decimals and it got through .
We could not believe it .
He is so excited . &quot;
But I was excited , so I kept going .
And then a few other things started to dawn on me .
Assuming he was good . We don &apos;t know .
It &apos;s good for motivated students .
It &apos;s good for maybe home schoolers . &quot;
But then I started getting letters from teachers .
Now they &apos;re actually interacting with each other .
The ones I started were much more primitive .
This is a more competent version of it .
And the Khan Academy videos are there .
And then you go build on that in the next concept .
You can &apos;t quite stop .
You &apos;re an 80 percent bicyclist . &quot;
Stay on that bicycle . Fall off that bicycle .
Do it as long as necessary until you have mastery .
We encourage you to experiment . We encourage you to failure .
But we do expect mastery .
This is just another one of the modules .
This is trigonometry .
This is shifting and reflecting functions .
And they all fit together .
We have about 90 of these right now .
It &apos;s like one plus one is equal to two .
Further down , you start getting into pre-algebra and early algebra .
It &apos;ll change what happens at the dinner table .
Every row is a student .
Every column is one of those concepts .
Green means the student &apos;s already proficient .
Red means they &apos;re stuck .
and all of the rest .
The outer circle shows what exercises they were focused on .
The inner circle shows the videos they &apos;re focused on .
Red is wrong , blue is right .
The leftmost question is the first question that the student attempted .
They watched the video right over there .
They also got faster .
The height is how long it took them .
Maybe they should be tracked differently .
Maybe we should put them in different classes . &quot;
And we &apos;re seeing it over and over and over again .
And actually , that kind of brings an interesting point .
In our mind , the relevant metric is student-to-valuable-human-time- with-the-teacher ratio .
Now 100 percent of their time is .
But this is all one system .
And that &apos;s essentially what we &apos;re trying to build .
Thank you .
Tell me what you &apos;re thinking there .
It &apos;s actually been pretty interesting .
SK : Los Altos , it was kind of crazy .
And they &apos;re doing it at the district level .
It &apos;s not an only-in-school thing .
And we can track everything .
So we made that focus diagram .
So it &apos;s all been teacher-driven .
It &apos;s been pretty crazy .
Is this ready for prime time ?
SK : Yeah , it &apos;s ready .
And the vision of the tutoring thing .
But yeah , it &apos;s all there .
Well , it &apos;s amazing .
Thank you .
Chip Conley : Measuring what makes life worthwhile
Because what we actually count truly counts .
Let me start by telling you a little story .
This is Van Quach .
She came to this country in 1986 from Vietnam .
So Vivian and I have been working together for 23 years .
Well , not exactly , of course not .
Our customer loyalty skyrocketed .
I went to Bhutan .
Why don &apos;t we care more about gross national happiness ? &quot;
But the king was serious .
And I got to spend some time with the prime minister .
Over dinner , I asked him an impertinent question .
We create the conditions for happiness to occur .
In other words , we create a habitat of happiness . &quot;
Wow , that &apos;s interesting .
Time is one of the scarcest resources in the modern world .
How many know him ? Anybody ?
We are a bottom-heavy culture in more ways than one .
Do we pursue happiness with hostility ?
Good question . But back to Bhutan .
I like it .
Co-branding opportunities .
So it suggests that the momentum is shifting .
Wow .
So how do we do that ?
We &apos;re spending 10 billion dollars on the census .
We &apos;re asking 10 simple questions -- it is simplicity .
But all of those questions are tangible .
They &apos;re about demographics .
That &apos;s about it .
We &apos;re not asking meaningful metrics .
We &apos;re not asking important questions .
We &apos;re not asking anything that &apos;s intangible .
We &apos;ve been fooled by our tool .
Excuse that expression .
We &apos;ve been fooled by our tool .
GDP has been our hammer .
I guess I &apos;m sort of a curious CEO .
I was also a curious economics major as an undergrad .
They aren &apos;t the same .
They &apos;ve created a habitat of happiness for Dave .
We count numbers .
We count on people .
What can you start counting today ?
Thank you very much .
Joseph Pine : What consumers want
Think about meaningful places .
Those are all experiences . Think about TED itself .
The experience capital in the world of conferences .
All of these are experiences .
You know the words I mean ?
You Americans .
They say , you Americans .
Why ? Because the experience happens inside of us .
And the Dutch , they always go ...
and they realize , I &apos;m right !
Becoming the basis of the economy .
We &apos;re the agrarian economy , and we &apos;re supplying commodities .
It &apos;s about supply and availability .
Getting the commodities to market .
With the service economy , it is about improving quality .
Rendering authenticity -- and the keyword is &quot; rendering . &quot;
So , how do you render authenticity , is the question .
Are you rendering authenticity ?
And those three verses are the core of authenticity .
All right ? Anybody else like that , no ?
The opposite , of course , is -- fake fake .
All right , now , there is value for fake .
But is it really true to itself ?
Right ? Is it really in the city ?
So she calls it a real fake .
We won &apos;t talk about Santa Claus then .
But Disney World is wonderfully true to itself .
Right ? Just wonderfully true to itself .
So , it &apos;s a fake real .
So , you have to understand that past .
Think about Disney again .
Because it is no longer true to itself .
Think about any hotel , any airline , any hospital .
Then you have that perception that you are phony .
For people to experience who you are .
Right , it &apos;s not advertising does it .
Right ? Coffee , at its core , is what ?
So , authenticity is becoming the new consumer sensibility .
Thank you .
Sarah Kaminsky : My father the forger
You understand &quot; forged currency , &quot; &quot; forged pictures . &quot;
My father is no such man .
Let me introduce him .
Here is my father at age 19 .
He quickly became the false papers expert of the Resistance .
This is me in the middle making faces .
well , he was basically old enough to be my grandfather .
She yelled at me like she never had before .
I heard him come in .
Indeed , it &apos;s rather small .
I was born in Algeria .
And indeed , I was very far from the mark .
These are real !
These are mine , I was born an Argentinean .
And then , suddenly , I went &quot; wow ! &quot;
My father , a secret agent ?
It was very James Bond .
So , his story . My father was born in Argentina .
His parents were of Russian descent .
So at the age of 14 my father had to work .
He was mostly interested in ink bleaching .
His family was Jewish , so they were hounded .
It was my grandfather who decided they needed false documents .
Suddenly the man looked very , very interested .
Of course he knew .
But it was only the beginning .
That &apos;s my father .
All the movements stopped at falsifying .
He told himself it was necessary to make them from scratch .
He started a press . He started photoengraving .
He started making rubber stamps .
If he slept one hour , 30 people would die .
To him , being paid would have meant being a mercenary .
He was broke all of the time .
One day my father introduced me to my sister .
They are both in their sixties now .
And then he would not come .
Then one day he totally disappeared .
And then my father connected with Nelson Mandela &apos;s anti-apartheid party .
He made false papers for persecuted black South Africans .
There was also Latin America .
Then there was the Vietnam War .
Europe was not spared either .
There , just once , it happened in May of 1968 .
And those heroes did not need an army behind them .
He said no .
He &apos;s still dreaming about it .
My father is here in the room today .
Thank you .
Dimitar Sasselov : How we found hundreds of potential Earth-like planets
Well , indeed , I &apos;m very , very lucky .
That match was unambiguous .
But there was no evidence .
&quot; What is life ? What is the origin of life ?
Are we alone ? &quot;
Now , the good news .
It &apos;s a new telescope .
All the stars for Kepler are just points of light .
So , what have we learned ?
We do that in our solar system .
Now the total planet number in our solar system was nine .
And that &apos;s what the frustration was .
The Copernican dream was unfulfilled .
But you see , we haven &apos;t gone very far .
We were still back where Copernicus was .
And we didn &apos;t have the evidence for that .
You can see here , the small planets dominate the picture .
And now for the first time , we can say that .
Most of these are candidates .
In the next few years we will confirm them .
But the statistical result is loud and clear .
So the question is : what do we do next ?
It &apos;s about 100 million such planets .
That &apos;s great news . Why ?
We know and expect that we &apos;ll see that .
That &apos;s great , but that is not the whole news .
That &apos;s not why I &apos;m here .
And so , that &apos;s what we are trying to do .
And that &apos;s what many people now are trying to do .
So why should you care about that ?
Why am I trying to sell you a half-built bridge ?
Am I that charming ?
But there is something more profound here , something deeper .
And the more we learn , the more that was reinforced .
And the bigger the telescope , the bigger that universe becomes .
And look at this image of the tiny , blue dot .
This pixel is the Earth .
It is the Earth as we know it .
But it &apos;s really tiny .
We know that .
The biosphere is the size of the Earth .
Life on Earth is the size of the Earth .
What if that Copernican insignificance was actually all wrong ?
Would that make us more responsible for what is happening today ?
Let &apos;s actually try that .
So in space , the Earth is very small .
Can you imagine how small it is ?
Let me try it .
It will be the size of a single , small atom .
It is unimaginably small .
We can &apos;t imagine it .
But that &apos;s not the whole story , you see .
The universe and life are both in space and time .
This is not insignificant .
This is very significant .
So what does this tell us ?
And let &apos;s do it .
Thank you very much .
Peter Hirshberg : The web is more than &quot; better TV &quot;
Well , good morning .
Peter Hirshberg : Which is more fun , Internet or TV ?
Girls : Internet .
Girl 2 : And then you can download onto your iPod .
Girl 4 : I wouldn &apos;t like it .
Girl 2 : That would be so stressful .
Girl 5 : No .
PH : How come ?
I &apos;m going to do a summer internship at Time Warner .
But they were onto something and they got better at it .
Journalist : It &apos;s a Whirlwind electronic computer .
With considerable trepidation , we undertake to interview this new machine .
Jay Forrester : Hello New York , this is Cambridge .
And this is the oscilloscope of the Whirlwind electronic computer .
Would you like if I used the machine ?
This rocket goes up 135 miles into the sky .
How &apos;s that ?
Journalist : What about that , Admiral ?
CB : Looks very good to me .
Enter the atomic bomb .
Talk about a shot in the arm for the computer industry .
Here &apos;s their marketing video .
And then it would be too late to act .
We cannot afford to take that chance .
PH : You know , that one computer was huge .
This is a really good example of that .
All of this stuff starts moving into industry .
DEC kind of reduces all this and makes the first mini-computer .
DEC knew a good thing about wasting time .
It shipped every one of its computers with that game .
In fact , despair is in the air .
And they fake it .
First of all , get your Winky Dink kits out .
Come on into the secret lab .
I assure you , that &apos;s not the case .
Here he is talking from the 1960s .
PH : You know , McLuhan talked about the global village .
It &apos;s a sort of Ann Landers &apos; column writ large .
We &apos;re now right into the 1960s .
But all that was about to change .
The Grateful Dead was playing in the pizza parlors .
People were leaving to go back to the land .
There was the Vietnam War . There was black liberation .
There was women &apos;s liberation .
This was a remarkable place , at a remarkable time .
And into that ferment came the microprocessor .
I think it was that interaction that led to personal computing .
And most importantly , they had this ethos of sharing information .
There was no metaphor . Was it a database ?
A prototyping tool ? A scripted language ?
Here &apos;s the Apple marketing video .
PH : I hope you realize how subversive that is .
That &apos;s like a Dick Cheney speech .
A few years later , Tim Berners-Lee worked that out .
Let us recall the pioneers who made this technical marvel possible .
Though some were incredulous ... Man 1 : The phone company !
Never had scientists been put under such pressure and demand .
The medium introduced America to new products .
In 1939 , the Radio Corporation of America introduced television .
Never had scientists been put under such pressure and demand .
And the forces of convergence exploded .
Finally , four great industrial sectors combined .
Telecommunications , entertainment , computing and everything else .
Thomas Edison had the same problem .
Well , you know where we &apos;re going on from here .
It &apos;s the formidable thing that is changing entertainment now .
Voices 2 , 3 and 4 : With her ?
Voice 2 : Well , there goes the neighborhood .
Which means television advertising is down 57 percent for Nike .
We &apos;re in the business of connecting with consumers . &quot;
And media companies realize the audience is important also .
PH : I think it &apos;s a great time of enthrallment .
Thanks very much .
Nadia Al-Sakkaf : See Yemen through my eyes
Nadia Al-Sakkaf : Well , I &apos;m glad to be here .
So many people are there .
The intensity of the upspring .
I love this picture .
And expression also , it has brought talents .
Obviously , there &apos;s always the dark side of it .
Is it going to be so many different countries ?
Is it going to be another Somalia ?
PM : Thank you for those images , Nadia .
And yet , you yourself defy all those characterizations .
So let &apos;s talk about the personal story for a moment .
Your father is murdered .
I &apos;ve guessed you &apos;ve already noticed this by now .
But there &apos;s so much potential .
I wish I could show you my Yemen .
I wish you could see Yemen through my eyes .
Then you would know that there &apos;s so much to it .
He would say we are equal .
And he was such an extraordinary man .
And even my mother -- I owe it to my family .
A story : I studied in India .
And he said , &quot; You are the bridge . &quot;
And that is something I will keep in my heart forever .
PM : I don &apos;t think so .
It was very hard at first .
I didn &apos;t want to clash with people .
Brought in more women .
Brought in younger men .
And we have a more gender-balanced newsroom today .
The other thing is that it &apos;s about professionalism .
One of them is the IPI Free Media Pioneer Award .
So that was the answer to all the Yemeni people .
If you could please stand up , &#91; unclear &#93; .
He has been very supportive of me .
And this is true .
And I have done this throughout my work .
I &apos;ve tried to encourage young girls .
And I am a role model in Yemen .
A lot of people look up to me .
A lot of young girls look up to me .
You can be yourself and have your face .
And very , very difficult times .
Some of my reporters were arrested .
We had some court cases .
My father was assassinated .
Today , we are in a much better situation .
We &apos;ve created the credibility .
And that &apos;s not fair .
He wanted to do a documentary on what his editors wanted .
That thing .
Yeah , break dancing .
I &apos;m not so old .
I &apos;m just not in touch .
PM : Yes , you are .
N ShaketheDust.org.
PM : &quot; Shake the Dust . &quot;
PM : ShaketheDust.org.
And it definitely does give a different image of Yemen .
You spoke about the responsibility of the press .
So it &apos;s about the lack of research , basically .
I am an example , and there are others like me .
It &apos;s natural .
And the very best of luck to you .
YemenTimes.com.
N On Twitter also .
PM : So you are plugged in .
Anthony Atala : Growing new organs
And it shows the first time an organ was ever transplanted .
That was back in 1954 , 55 years ago .
Certainly many advances , many lives saved .
But we have a major shortage of organs .
That really has to do with our aging population .
We &apos;re just getting older .
Medicine is doing a better job of keeping us alive .
But as we age , our organs tend to fail more .
These are major issues .
This is actually a very stunning statistic .
So , what can we do about it ?
We &apos;ve talked about stem cells tonight .
That &apos;s a way to do it .
Wouldn &apos;t it be great if our bodies could regenerate ?
This is actually a picture of a salamander .
Salamanders have this amazing capacity to regenerate .
You see here a little video .
This is actually a limb injury in this salamander .
You see the scar form .
And that scar actually grows out a new limb .
So , salamanders can do it .
Why can &apos;t we ? Why can &apos;t humans regenerate ?
Actually , we can regenerate .
As you age , as you get older .
Your bones regenerate every 10 years .
Your skin regenerates every two weeks .
So , your body is constantly regenerating .
The challenge occurs when there is an injury .
So , how can we harness that power ?
And you see that it is injured .
That &apos;s exactly what you see here .
This was an injured urethra on the left side .
We used that biomaterial in the middle .
The maximum efficient distance for regeneration is only about one centimeter .
So , we do regenerate , but for limited distances .
What do we do when we have injuries than one centimeter ?
Then we can start to use cells .
It disintegrates a few months later .
It &apos;s acting only as a cell delivery vehicle .
And that &apos;s what we did for this piece of muscle .
What about other structures ?
This is actually an engineered blood vessel .
And we can then tubularize this scaffold .
A blood vessel is made up of two different cell types .
You place the muscle cells on the outside .
You place the vascular blood vessel lining cells on the inside .
You now have your fully seeded scaffold .
You &apos;re going to place this in an oven-like device .
But they are really acting mostly as conduits .
They are not nearly as complex as hollow organs .
So , the bladder is one such organ .
We grow the cells outside the body in large quantities .
We then take a scaffold that we shape like a bladder .
We coat the inside with these bladder lining cells .
We coat the outside with these muscle cells .
We place it back into this oven-like device .
This actually shows the scaffold .
The material is actually being coated with the cells .
It &apos;s true .
And I &apos;m sure everyone here wanted an extra-large . Right ?
This is actually a heart valve , which we engineered .
We exercise these prior to implantation .
Same strategy .
And then the most complex are the solid organs .
This is actually a simple solid organ like the ear .
It &apos;s now being seeded with cartilage .
This is actually digits that we &apos;re engineering .
We then start adding the muscle on top .
And you start layering these solid structures .
This is actually your typical desktop printer .
We can use it from one patient to the next .
You can see , actually that &apos;s a fluoroscopy .
We &apos;re actually injecting contrast into the organ .
And you can see the vascular tree that remains intact .
And we can then create functional livers .
And that &apos;s actually what you &apos;re seeing .
They are actually making urine .
Why ? Because they will not reject .
A windpipe cell already knows it &apos;s a windpipe cell .
So , we prefer organ-specific cells .
And for those we still need stem cells .
So , these are very tough technologies .
Once you get the formula right you can replicate it .
But it takes a lot to get there .
So , I always like to show this cartoon .
This is how to stop a runaway stage .
He finally stops the runaway stage .
I &apos;m a surgeon so that &apos;s not that funny .
But actually method A is the correct approach .
We started implanting some of these structures over 14 years ago .
I &apos;m going to show a clip of one young lady .
She had a spina bifida defect , a spinal cord abnormality .
We are just taking five seconds .
This is a segment that Sanjay Gupta actually took care of .
Thank you for your attention .
Christina Warinner : Tracking ancient diseases using ... plaque
Have you ever wondered what is inside your dental plaque ?
Probably not , but people like me do .
But this is only one half of the story .
But there are a lot of challenges for this .
And first of all , what do we even study ?
Skeletons are ubiquitous ; they &apos;re found all over the place .
Many of you may know it by the term tartar .
And we even find it in neanderthals and animals .
And so previous studies had only focused on microscopy .
And we also found bacteria that normally inhabit the gut .
Thank you .
Molly Crockett : Beware neuro-bunk
I &apos;m a neuroscientist , and I study decision-making .
So we did an experiment .
This is the amino acid tryptophan .
Cheese ? Chocolate ? Where did that come from ?
We gave people this horrible-tasting drink that affected their tryptophan levels .
So there you have it : the evolution of a headline .
And I think a lot of scientists have this attitude .
I have to say , this sounds awesome .
I could totally have used this 10 minutes ago .
But I didn &apos;t find any .
And it turns out that pictures of brains have special properties .
Really cool stuff .
The headline ? &quot; You Love Your iPhone . Literally . &quot;
It quickly became the most emailed article on the site .
So how &apos;d they figure this out ?
This time it &apos;s not a cheese sandwich .
No , it &apos;s a hormone called oxytocin .
You &apos;ve probably heard of it .
So he &apos;s calling oxytocin &quot; the moral molecule . &quot;
And in some cases , oxytocin can even decrease cooperation .
So we &apos;ve seen neuro-flapdoodle all over the headlines .
We see it in supermarkets , on book covers .
What about the clinic ?
This sounds great . A lot of people agree .
But we &apos;re not there yet .
So here &apos;s where you come in .
Ask the tough questions . Ask to see the evidence .
Thank you .
Steven Schwaitzberg : A universal translator for surgeons
So I want to talk to you about two things tonight .
Number one : Teaching surgery and doing surgery is really hard .
Now , nobody wants an operation .
Who here has had surgery ?
Did you want it ?
Keep your hands up if you wanted an operation .
Nobody wants an operation .
So let &apos;s see what it looks like .
So this is gallbladder surgery .
This is the real thing . There &apos;s no blood .
You can see it in their faces .
Let me tell you , surgeons are not born .
Surgeons are not made either .
There are no little tanks where we &apos;re making surgeons .
Surgeons are trained one step at a time .
It starts with a foundation , basic skills .
Then we teach them to be a surgeon in training .
And eventually , if you &apos;re lucky , you achieve mastery .
It &apos;s hard .
No , we just said all surgeons .
We can &apos;t travel everywhere .
We need to make the world a smaller place .
And one of the tools I like personally is using video .
So I was inspired by a friend .
This is Allan Okrainec from Toronto .
Very inspiring .
Let me bring it to you locally .
I work at the Cambridge Hospital .
It &apos;s the primary Harvard Medical School teaching facility .
It &apos;s a big labor-intensive effort .
We need to employ technology to assist us in this quest .
And there isn &apos;t always a translator available .
So we need tools .
We need a universal translator .
It &apos;s really about setting up a dialogue .
We have a lot to learn .
Maybe we have something to learn as well .
And it has to be bi-directional .
They have to be able to teach us something as well .
It &apos;s a big task .
Because we need a lexicon . What is a lexicon ?
A lexicon is a body of words that describes a domain .
I need to have a health care lexicon .
And in that I need a surgery lexicon .
So let me show you what we &apos;re doing .
This is research -- can &apos;t buy it .
We work with a fourth technology .
And we currently have access to eleven language pairs .
Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery .
Module five : manual skills practice .
Students may display captions in their native language .
But that &apos;s the lectures .
Allan Okrainec : Today we &apos;re going to practice suturing .
This is how you hold the needle .
Grab the needle at the tip .
It &apos;s important to be accurate .
Aim for the black dots .
Orient your loop this way .
Now go ahead and cut .
Very good Oscar . I &apos;ll see you next week .
We want it to be bi-directional .
We have a need to learn as well as to teach .
This is a ubiquitous tool .
Thank you very much .
Hans Rosling : New insights on poverty
I told you three things last year .
And that animated graphics can make a difference .
So three things have happened .
And let me repeat what you saw last year .
The bubbles are the countries .
There was a huge difference in the world .
But then it changed , and it went on quite well .
And this is what happens .
You can see how China is the red , big bubble .
The blue there is India .
And I will talk on , is this possible ?
Because this is where we are .
Will it be possible that this will happen ?
I cover my lifetime here , you know ?
I expect to live 100 years .
And this is where we are today .
And I would like to show that against child survival .
We &apos;ll swap the axis .
And this is GDP per capita on this axis .
And this was 2007 .
Some countries still had statistics .
And they lost one-fifth of their kids before their first birthday .
Isn &apos;t it beautiful when they get statistics ?
You see the importance of that ?
And here , children don &apos;t live longer .
There he died , then Deng Xiaoping brings money .
It moves this way over here .
Let us have a look at the United States .
They are on the money side all the time .
And look here -- compare to the Philippines of today .
Chile &apos;s catching up !
And behind the health is the educational level .
And I want to look at Sweden and the United States .
And here we go . Here we go .
And the Volvo is doing quite fine .
They really caught up .
And this changes gradually .
We have to look over generations to understand it .
And this is my family .
This is Sweden , 1830 , when my great-great-grandma was born .
Sweden was like Sierra Leone today .
And this is when great-grandma was born , 1863 .
And Sweden was like Mozambique .
And this is when my grandma was born , 1891 .
I think it &apos;s the best way of verifying historical statistics .
Sweden was like Ghana .
It &apos;s interesting to see the enormous diversity within sub-Saharan Africa .
I &apos;m the Mexican in the family .
But they &apos;re very small , you know ?
But homage to Singapore .
Singapore is the best one .
Now this looks also like a very good story .
Because I have to show you one of the other facilities .
Carbon-dioxide emission , metric ton per capita .
And what happens when we moved on ?
There is no one who has done it so far .
And there we are , 2001 .
But from now on , we count per capita .
From now on we count per capita .
And everyone is responsible for the per capita emission . &quot;
And this is really what has to be changed .
The world is quite a messy place .
This we can call Dollar Street .
Everyone lives on this street here .
This family earns about one dollar per day .
And how do they live ?
This is two to five dollars . You have a bed .
This can change . This can change .
We can get out of poverty .
And this is the result of the farmers-needs research .
When you &apos;re in poverty , everything is about survival .
It &apos;s about having food .
That &apos;s one context .
Getting out of poverty .
The women told us one thing . &quot; Get us technology .
We hate this mortar , to stand hours and hours .
It &apos;s also good with credit .
Micro-credits gave her the bicycle , you know .
You can do this .
Africa has not done bad .
Because we don &apos;t consider where they came from .
We have to know a little more about the world .
I have a neighbor who knows 200 types of wine .
He knows everything .
I only know two types of wine -- red and white .
And I know 200 , I know about the small data .
But you can do that .
You make a PowerPoint , you know ?
Homage to the Office package , no ?
I &apos;m telling you that there are many dimensions of development .
Everyone wants your pet thing .
If you are in the corporate sector , you love micro-credit .
We need everything .
Let me first grade what are the most important means .
It was the government that made law function finally .
Education , human resources are important .
Environment is important .
Now what about goals ? Where are we going toward ?
We are not interested in money .
Money is not a goal .
And that &apos;s good , it gets two plusses .
Environment is very , very crucial .
But where are the important goals ?
Of course , it &apos;s human rights .
That &apos;s the value of living .
So the seemingly impossible is possible .
Even African countries can achieve this .
Bring me my sword !
Sword swallowing is from ancient India .
And it &apos;s all solid steel -- you can hear here .
Can I request a moment of absolute silence ?
Patricia Kuhl : The linguistic genius of babies
I want you to take a look at this baby .
And she &apos;s talking to her baby .
And therein lies a critical puzzle .
Well , it &apos;s got to do with your brain .
After puberty , we fall off the map .
A six-monther adores the task .
What have we learned ?
We &apos;re culture-bound listeners .
And the answer : before their first birthdays .
So at six to eight months the babies are totally equivalent .
Two months later something incredible occurs .
So there are two things going on .
And those distributions grow .
English has a lot of Rs and Ls .
The distribution shows .
But we as adults are no longer absorbing those statistics .
It &apos;s raising lots of questions about bilingual people .
Six to eight months , they &apos;re totally equivalent .
Two months later , something incredible happens .
Here &apos;s what it looked like in the laboratory .
So a group of babies came in and listened to English .
What did we do to their brains ?
It takes a human being for babies to take their statistics .
It looks like a hair dryer from Mars .
But it &apos;s completely safe , completely non-invasive and silent .
So this is little Emma .
She &apos;s a six-monther .
You can see , she can move around .
It &apos;s a technical tour de force .
What are we seeing ?
We &apos;re seeing the baby brain .
Thank you .
Julian Assange : Why the world needs WikiLeaks
Julian , welcome .
Can that possibly be true ?
Julian Assange : Yeah , can it possibly be true ?
How does it work ?
How do people release the documents ?
And how do you secure their privacy ?
God damn it .
So let &apos;s take &#91; an &#93; example , actually .
This is something you leaked a few years ago .
If we can have this document up ...
So this was a story in Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you leaked and what happened ?
J So this is the Kroll Report .
He was a soft dictator of Kenya .
It &apos;s the Holy Grail of Kenyan journalism .
And so it came in from the outside .
Wow , so your leak really substantially changed the world ?
J Yep .
You &apos;re clear . All right . Firing .
Light &apos; em all up .
C &apos;mon , fire !
Keep shoot &apos; n . Keep shoot &apos; n .
Keep shoot &apos; n .
All right , we just engaged all eight individuals .
Roger . I got &apos; em .
Two-Six , this is Two-Six , we &apos;re mobile .
Oops , I &apos;m sorry . What was going on ?
So , what was the impact of that ?
There were between 18 and 26 people killed all together .
And releasing this caused widespread outrage .
I mean , did he ?
J We have denied receiving those cables .
I mean , I was a known visitor of that embassy .
J We would have released them .
J Yeah .
So let &apos;s talk a little more broadly about this .
I mean , in general , what &apos;s your philosophy ?
Why is it right to encourage leaking of secret information ?
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
J Not that we have seen with anything we have released .
I mean , we have a harm immunization policy .
So they are well-motivated .
It shows a U.S. soldier laughing at people dying .
What would you say to that ?
J Yeah , we do get a lot of that .
That &apos;s what they see every day .
Light is good .
We don &apos;t have sources who are dissidents on other sources .
Dangerous troublemaker .
Who &apos;s got the hero view ?
Who &apos;s got the dangerous troublemaker view ?
J Oh , come on . There must be some .
It &apos;s a soft crowd , Julian , a soft crowd .
What is this ?
We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
And we were like , &quot; Oh , tell us more .
What document is it , precisely , you &apos;re talking about ?
Can you show that you had legal authority over that document ?
Is it really yours ? &quot;
Yeah .
That &apos;s happened quite a lot though .
Yeah . Have you had information from inside BP ?
That &apos;s a problem .
J Yep . Yeah , and trusted people .
Can that be right ?
J What , the movie business ?
J Well , I was a journalist .
So you have to be careful with hacker .
J I &apos;m not sure about the incident .
Instead , they publicized your side .
That made you very high-profile in Iceland . What happened next ?
J Yeah , this is a great case , you know .
Iceland went through this financial crisis .
It was the hardest hit of any country in the world .
Anyway , so we release this report in July last year .
Wow .
Last question , Julian .
J Thank you , Chris .
Andrew Bird : A one-man orchestra of the imagination
So , I wanted to do something special today .
Because it gets into all sorts of crazy realms .
They &apos;re feedback loops .
And I &apos;m going to demonstrate for you .
I &apos;m not going to hurt you . Don &apos;t worry .
And it &apos;s like your eyes start straining to see themselves .
That &apos;s what it feels like to me .
It &apos;s not pleasant .
I &apos;m sorry if I put that idea in your head .
That &apos;s the thing .
And that &apos;s what the song is asking .
All right .
It doesn &apos;t have a name yet .
All right .
Charles Limb : Your brain on improv
And so why don &apos;t we go and click the video .
It &apos;s really a remarkable , awesome thing that happens there .
I think -- how can this possibly be ?
There &apos;s not too many brain-dead people creating art .
Is it truly possible to study creativity scientifically ?
And I think that &apos;s a good question .
Maybe we &apos;re not the right people to do it .
And so it gets down to the brain .
And fundamentally that &apos;s what I do in my lab .
Now the way that &apos;s done is by the following .
Deoxyhemoglobin can be detected by MRI , whereas oxyhemoglobin can &apos;t .
This is a short video of how we did this project .
CL : Okay , so it works .
We actually have to come up with a scientific experiment .
And the musicians , they were comfortable in the end .
And so we first measured the number of notes .
That was not what was going on .
And then we looked at the brain activity .
I &apos;m going to try to condense this for you .
Now these are multifunctional areas of the brain .
Really , consciousness is seated in the frontal lobe .
So this is a twelve-bar blues .
Nurse : Nothing &apos;s in your pockets , right Mike ?
It &apos;s kind of fun actually .
And so now we &apos;re playing back and forth .
And it &apos;s good that it &apos;s not too quick .
That was challenging .
This is one subject &apos;s data .
This is , in fact , Mike Pope &apos;s data .
So what am I showing you here ?
He actually had it also homologous on the right .
This is an area thought to be involved in expressive communication .
Rap , of course , rap -- free-style .
And so I &apos;ve always been fascinated by free-style .
And let &apos;s go ahead and play this video here .
So how do you study rap scientifically ?
And then I thought -- But here &apos;s the thing .
This is the control condition . This is what they memorized .
Go ahead and hit that right sound icon .
He doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s coming .
It &apos;s doing something that , neurologically , is remarkable .
Whether or not you like the music is irrelevant .
Creatively speaking , it &apos;s just a phenomenal thing .
CL : We &apos;re here with Emmanuel .
CL : That &apos;s Emmanuel in the scanner .
He &apos;s just memorized a rhyme for us .
Well , this is actually four rappers &apos; brains .
Dean Ornish : The killer American diet that &apos;s sweeping the planet
Afra Raymond : Three myths about corruption
Okay ? Friends , family and financiers .
That &apos;s the honest truth .
The point I &apos;m making is that it is a crime .
Public and private corruption is a reality .
It &apos;s a piece of public mischief .
We call them petrodollars . The treasury was bursting with money .
You see , history &apos;s rich in irony .
Okay ? We &apos;re talking about irresponsibility in public office .
It went right into my heart .
So the 10 or 15 percent is pure mischief .
As we say , it &apos;s a nancy-story . Forget it .
Okay ? This is the size of the problem .
Okay ? Two thirds of the money stolen or wasted .
That was 30 years ago . 1982 was Ballah .
So what has changed ?
the Piarco Airport accused .
I &apos;m going to have my own lexicon speaking here today .
They are the Piarco Airport accused .
Our highest institution in our country was perverted .
Do you get how serious this problem is ?
That &apos;s the word lawyers use . It was repealed .
So that is the kind of outrage of the thing .
And that gave me a lot of hope . Okay ?
But what were they accused of ?
What was it that they were accused of ?
My brain started thinking .
But what if this wasn &apos;t the first time ?
CL Financial is the Caribbean &apos;s largest ever conglomerate , okay ?
Let &apos;s understand , because we lack context .
It &apos;s not just like anywhere .
I &apos;m serious now .
Listen . They &apos;ve had bailouts on Wall Street .
They &apos;ve had bailouts in London .
They &apos;ve had bailouts in Europe .
Only here . So what was the reason for the generosity ?
Is our government that generous ? And maybe they are .
Let &apos;s look at it . Let &apos;s look into it .
It &apos;s a not-for-profit blog that I run .
Okay ? We want to try to recalculate .
The Ministry of Finance is the next tower over .
This is the other context .
That is the law since 1999 .
Here is not like anywhere else .
What are the figures he &apos;s relying on ?
So they hit my question with a question .
There &apos;s a particular individual who is in the government now .
The name of the person doesn &apos;t matter .
Okay ? His name isn &apos;t important .
I wouldn &apos;t dignify it . I &apos;m on a point .
Fantastic .
I &apos;ve asked the question in the legal and required fashion .
It &apos;s been ignored .
And this is my reality check .
We will continue to press on .
We will continue to work within JCC .
I could see what you &apos;re applying for .
We need to increase the consciousness .
Discard the first myth ; it is a crime .
Discard the second myth ; it is a big thing .
It &apos;s a huge problem . It &apos;s an economic crime .
A happy song about global warming , from Jill Sobule .
Okay .
Rating agencies are rating companies .
They are rating banks .
They are rating even financial products like the infamous mortgage-backed securities .
Be honest .
Well , ratings affect you .
They affect all of us .
There is no incentive to improve the quality of your product .
Obviously not , right ? That would be irresponsible .
I think it &apos;s time for a bold move .
I think it &apos;s time to upgrade the system .
But this is not enough to make a difference , right ?
Think about it that way .
How is it managed ?
It &apos;s time to give them some company .
Thank you .
Evan Grant : Making sound visible through cymatics
And so this basically led me to a subject called cymatics .
He actually coined the term cymatics .
He &apos;s kindly recreated for us the Chladni experiment .
As you can see with your own eyes .
So , what excites me about cymatics ?
Well , for me cymatics is an almost magical tool .
It &apos;s like a looking glass into a hidden world .
And the list of scientific applications is growing every day .
We can also use cymatics for healing and education .
We can also use cymatics as a beautiful natural art form .
We can also use cymatics as a looking glass into nature .
And we can actually recreate the archetypal forms of nature .
Then on the right we can see a cymatically created snowflake .
And here is a starfish and a cymatic starfish .
And there is thousands of these .
So what does this all mean ?
But consider for a moment that sound does have form .
And think about the immense sound of the universe forming .
Cymatics is accessible to everybody .
I think collectively we can build a global community .
We can inspire each other .
Nina Tandon : Could tissue engineering mean personalized medicine ?
Did I mention they &apos;re gorgeous ?
And they &apos;re scientific models ?
And the later it fails , the worse the consequences .
Let &apos;s see how we can do it with tissue engineering .
They were developed in Japan pretty recently .
Okay , induced pluripotent stem cells .
So without the controversy , that &apos;s cool thing number one .
It would be like having a clinical trial on a chip .
Here &apos;s an example from Kevin Eggan &apos;s lab at Harvard .
This is a degeneration of the retina .
Don &apos;t you miss all that with these tissue-engineered models ?
Well , this is another trend in the field .
Thank you .
The LXD : In the Internet age , dance evolves ...
Anybody ? Anybody ? Yeah !
I &apos;d never seen anything like that .
I grew up in a musical family .
And those guys , those were like , ultimate heroes .
They &apos;re here , getting better and better every day .
And dance has progressed .
It is insane what dance is right now .
Dance has never had a better friend than technology .
Online videos and social networking ...
And this is happening every day .
Please be excited , have fun , yell , scream .
Ladies and gentlemen : The LXD .
And then another thing opens , you close that .
I got my name just because I was so young .
You know , you create power , then you tame it .
Svante Pääbo : DNA clues to our inner neanderthal
And these mutations accumulate approximately as a function of time .
Approximately one letter in a hundred will differ from a chimpanzee .
In this case , it &apos;s very simple .
Farther back is there one shared with chimpanzees .
And they are around three billion such letters long .
Yet the people inside Africa have more genetic variation .
Well we can begin to ask those questions also .
They &apos;ve sequenced 185 Africans from two populations in Africa .
And it &apos;s a lot : 38 million variable positions .
Perhaps the biggest difference most of us would imagine existed .
This may be surprising .
Maybe a single individual is misclassified or so .
So this is very surprising .
So an interesting question is , what happened when we met ?
What happened to the Neanderthals ?
Did we mix or not ?
Does it match one African or the other African ?
And that &apos;s indeed the case .
Well I don &apos;t think that is the case .
Presumably , modern humans emerged somewhere in Africa .
Thank you for your attention .
Shlomo Benartzi : Saving for tomorrow , tomorrow
I &apos;m going to talk about Save More Tomorrow .
Now you might ask , what is behavioral finance ?
So let &apos;s think about how we manage our money .
Let &apos;s start with mortgages .
And then they foreclose .
We were risk takers , of course .
Then market stocks seize and we &apos;re like , &quot; Wow .
How many of you have iPhones ?
Anyone ? Wonderful .
What if you lose your iPhone ?
What if you do this ?
How many of you have kids ?
Anyone ?
Keep your hands up if you have sufficient life insurance .
I see a lot of hands coming down .
We &apos;re not doing that well when it comes to insurance .
The average American household spends 1,000 dollars a year on lotteries .
And I know it sounds crazy .
No one .
Low-income people spend a lot more than a thousand on lotteries .
So where does it take us ?
We &apos;re not doing a great job managing money .
And that &apos;s what I really want to focus on today .
I want to address the issue of savings .
We have on the screen a representative sample of 100 Americans .
And we &apos;re going to look at their saving behavior .
They cannot make savings easy .
What about the remaining half of the people ?
Some of them elect not to save .
They &apos;re just too lazy .
And they get overwhelmed and the just don &apos;t join .
How many people end up saving to a 401 plan ?
One third of Americans .
Two thirds are not saving now .
Are they saving enough ?
Take out those who say they save too little .
One out of 10 are saving enough .
We think we have a problem of people saving too much .
Let &apos;s look at that .
What are we going to do about it ?
That &apos;s what I really want to focus on .
I &apos;m going to divert and talk about bananas and chocolate .
Suppose we had another wonderful TED event next week .
Who would go for bananas ?
Wonderful .
I predict scientifically 74 percent of you will go for bananas .
Well that &apos;s at least what one wonderful study predicted .
Self-control is not a problem in the future .
Or as some economists call it , present bias .
We think about saving . We know we should be saving .
Wonderful study comparing different countries .
Not many people like checking boxes .
It takes effort . You need to think .
Twelve percent do .
Austria , a neighboring country , slightly similar , slightly different .
What &apos;s the difference ?
Well , you still have choice .
Nobody checks boxes .
That &apos;s kind of too much effort .
One percent check the box . The rest do nothing .
Doing nothing is very common .
Not many people check boxes .
What are the implications to saving lives and having organs available ?
In Germany , 12 percent check the box .
Twelve percent are organ donors .
In Austria , again , nobody checks the box .
Therefore , 99 percent of people are organ donors .
Inertia , lack of action .
Very powerful .
And checking the box takes effort .
So we &apos;ve chatted about a couple of behavioral challenges .
The other group gets two apples , one is taken away .
They still have an apple left .
They &apos;re really mad .
Why have you taken our apple ?
This is the notion of loss aversion .
Those 20 dollars might have been a quick lunch .
It &apos;s a lot more fun to spend now .
We talked about inertia and organ donations and checking the box .
How is it going to solve the challenges we chatted about ?
We think we &apos;re going to save more next year .
Save More Tomorrow makes it easy .
It &apos;s an autopilot .
Well , maybe it shouldn &apos;t be just January .
Saving more today is not an option .
And here are the results .
It &apos;s real .
It &apos;s not just numbers on a piece of paper .
This is a real difference .
It &apos;s been part of the Pension Protection Act .
Let me wrap with two key messages .
One is behavioral finance is extremely powerful .
This is just one example .
Message two is there &apos;s still a lot to do .
This is really the tip of the iceberg .
The average actually , the record is in Singapore .
The average household spends $ 4,000 a year on lottery tickets .
One , two , three , four .
Less than three percent of a very sophisticated audience .
Behavioral finance has a long way .
Thank you .
Paola Antonelli : Why I brought Pac-Man to MoMA
I &apos;m almost like a crazy evangelical .
I love them . So we are in the right quadrant .
So the first was Jonathan Jones from The Guardian .
&quot; Sorry , MoMA , video games are not art . &quot;
We were talking about the rapture ? It &apos;s coming .
And Jonathan Jones is making it happen .
No . Designers aspire to be really great designers .
Thank you very much . And that &apos;s more than enough .
And that was fantastic . And I thought that was it .
&quot; The museum is putting Pac-Man alongside Picasso . &quot; Again .
&quot; That misses the point . &quot;
Excuse me . You &apos;re missing the point .
And you know what ?
I think this was truly fantastic .
I consider myself the tide of shit .
You know , we have to go through that .
And it &apos;s fantastic .
We worked on it for a year and a half .
We bugged everybody , because we knew that we were ignorant .
They were also criteria of exhibition and of preservation .
I mean , that interface is beautiful .
I &apos;m sure that all of you know Katamari Damacy .
It was a PlayStation game , but mostly for Japan .
Not to mention Eve Online .
Of course , there are games that are even more educational .
Right ? We had to make decisions .
And I was like , &quot; Why ? &quot;
So it &apos;s very interesting .
We have Street Fighter II , because martial arts are good .
So it was not very constructive .
Then we have a few also side-scrollers -- classical ones .
So it &apos;s quite a hefty collection .
You acquire the relationship with the company .
It &apos;s very hard to get , of course .
They also preserve artifacts for posterity .
We &apos;re going to stay with them forever .
They &apos;re not going to get rid of us .
And one day , we &apos;ll get that code .
And so is space , the spatial aspect of games .
But the spatial evolution in video games is extremely important .
The real core issue of interaction design is behavior .
They &apos;re not just limited to our interaction with the screen .
I would like to do the same with video games .
I would like to acquire it , but without owning it .
I want it to keep flying .
Thank you very much .
Peter Saul : Let &apos;s talk about dying
There will be no exceptions to that .
So there you go . That &apos;s the truth .
This has been fantastic .
We have machines that go ping .
There &apos;s many of them up there .
I was called down to the ward to see him .
His is the little hand .
Which is a familiar phrase to us .
You can see his bones through the skin .
I thought , &quot; Okay . Take this steady . &quot;
Jim was 94 .
And I realized that something wasn &apos;t happening here .
One in a hundred .
Now , I work in acute care .
This is John Hunter Hospital .
And I thought , surely , we do better than that .
In the U.S. , it &apos;s one in five .
These are the four ways to go .
So one of these will happen to all of us .
Sudden death has become very rare .
The big growth industry are these .
Enjoying it so far ?
You know , historically , we didn &apos;t do that .
I &apos;m sorry to say that .
She looks terrified .
It &apos;s an amazing picture .
Anyway , we had a major cultural issue .
We were able to make that happen for them .
The cultural issue had reasserted itself .
And this is the small idea .
There are a couple of things you can do .
So that &apos;s the little idea .
The big idea , I think , is more political .
I think we have to get onto this .
I suggested we should have Occupy Death .
Yeah , yeah . Sure . &quot;
Now , I &apos;m an aging hippie .
Now , listen , that sounds like a pitch for euthanasia .
I don &apos;t think euthanasia matters .
It deprives euthanasia of its oxygen supply .
She founded the hospice movement .
Thank you .
And what I found really surprised me .
But I was intrigued .
I mean , satellite imagery is pretty amazing stuff .
How much oil is stored in all of China ?
How much corn is being produced ?
How many ships are in all of our world &apos;s ports ?
Why do these things have to be so expensive ?
This was hitchhiking small satellites alongside much larger satellites .
We had found our compromise .
So now we had our constraint .
The big challenge became actually taking the pictures through that telescope .
The problem with them is they require very sophisticated pointing .
So why do all of this ? Why build these satellites ?
Thank you .
We &apos;re having a debate .
Okay , hands down .
Those who are against , raise your hands .
Stewart Brand : Whoa .
Look at the client base for this .
live in the developing world .
That &apos;s where it is on all the time .
Nuclear is and has been for 40 years .
Then what happens to the waste ?
Wind is wonderful ; I love wind .
I love being around these big wind generators .
They &apos;ve run out of good sites .
The power lines are getting overloaded .
And you peak out .
It &apos;s okay on frapped-out agricultural land .
Solar &apos;s wonderful on rooftops .
Ten percent of American electricity comes from decommissioned warheads .
We haven &apos;t even started the American stockpile .
This is one from Toshiba .
And that would be very interesting in the developing world .
Typically , these things are put in the ground .
They &apos;re referred to as nuclear batteries .
Thorium reactor that Nathan Myhrvold &apos;s involved in .
And here &apos;s the future .
Okay . Okay .
Mark Jacobson : Thank you .
And it also enhances nuclear weapons proliferation .
Nuclear -- there are two bars here .
The low estimate is the nuclear energy industry estimate of nuclear .
The high is the average of 103 scientific , peer-reviewed studies .
And this is just the CO2 from the life cycle .
North Korea did that to some extent .
Iran is doing that right now .
would be this .
So , do we need this ?
The spacing is something else .
That &apos;s the footprint that is always being confused .
People confuse footprint with spacing .
Over the ocean , it &apos;s not even land .
That &apos;s cellulosic , second generation biofuels from prairie grass .
Here &apos;s corn ethanol . It &apos;s smaller .
And this is to power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet .
Matching the reliability , base load is actually irrelevant .
We want to match the hour-by-hour power supply .
You can do that by combining renewables .
Here are the world wind resources .
So then here &apos;s the final ranking .
If you use wind , you guarantee ice will last .
All right .
If you &apos;re against , put up one .
And I want two of each for the mics .
Of those , seven have nuclear weapons .
There &apos;s plenty of solar and wind .
That &apos;s from real data .
There &apos;s absolutely no need for nuclear power .
We need someone for .
And I want to support Stewart Brand &apos;s position .
I &apos;ve come around in the last 10 years .
I used to be against nuclear power .
Thank you Rod Beckstrom . Against .
The first is : be aware of the propaganda .
The propaganda from the industry has been very , very strong .
Be very aware of the propaganda .
Secondly , think about this .
Tell me they &apos;re not going to have accidents .
Thank you .
For .
Anyone else for ? Go .
I &apos;ve got solar PV on my roof .
However , there &apos;s a basic arithmetic problem here .
We &apos;re not going to get enough energy from renewables alone .
We need a solution that generates all of the time .
Thank you .
Anyone else against ?
I will also add one other thing .
Point well made . Thank you .
Your final pitch , Stewart .
It was a sunny day and a windy night .
And just now in England they had a cold spell .
None of those things were stirring .
Two gigawatts comes through the Chunnel .
This keeps happening .
I used to worry about the 10,000 year factor .
And especially the small reactors need to go forward .
Fifteen percent of the entire U.S.
has wind at fast enough speeds to be cost-competitive .
And there &apos;s much more solar than there is wind .
There &apos;s plenty of resource . You can make it reliable .
Okay . So , thank you , Mark .
So if you were in Palm Springs ...
Shameless . Shameless . Shameless .
All those in favor , raise your hands .
And all those against .
Ooooh .
Okay . So here &apos;s the read on it .
You both won . I congratulate both of you .
Thank you for that .
Clay Shirky : How social media can make history
You probably read something about it in the papers .
And so a plan came up to video the vote .
It &apos;s when everybody is able to take them for granted .
That is a huge transformation .
Slow , text-based conversations , then real-time voice based conversations .
But there is a curious asymmetry here .
And this is what changed .
That &apos;s one of the big changes .
And it &apos;s not just Internet or no Internet .
Second story .
And the earthquake was reported as it was happening .
They were taking videos of buildings shaking .
They were Twittering it .
And so as the quake was happening the news was reported .
And this stuff rippled like wildfire .
But nine of the 10 in those first hours .
This was an incredible , coordinated global response .
And then this happened .
And so the protest kept going .
And finally the Chinese cracked down .
That was enough of citizen media .
And so they began to arrest the protesters .
The media was produced locally . It was produced by amateurs .
And in fact that is happening this week .
They had to turn the spigot entirely off .
And here is the twentieth century answer .
Bundle up the message . Send the same message to everybody .
National message . Targeted individuals .
Relatively sparse number of producers .
This is how you reach people .
All of that is over .
The audience can talk back .
Those days are over , never to return .
An incredible conversation sprung up there .
I &apos;m going to vote for this bill . &quot;
&quot; Please get FISA right . &quot;
Obama had to issue a press release .
He had to issue a reply .
And he said essentially , &quot; I have considered the issue .
I understand where you are coming from .
That &apos;s the media environment we &apos;ve got .
Thank you very much .
Johanna Blakley : Social media and the end of gender
Let me connect the dots .
It &apos;s old-school demographics .
They come up with these very restrictive labels to define us .
It &apos;s really just been basic demographics .
They can make some educated guesses .
It had been presumed before .
That would tell me something more substantial about you .
Will the next big-budget blockbuster movies actually be chick flicks ?
This is far too simplistic .
Why should I know this ?
This is a very important thing to know about people .
Can you even imagine what that looks like ?
I can &apos;t wait to find out what it looks like .
Thank you so much .
However , grilled chicken poses a hidden danger .
Studies show that antioxidants are known to decrease these heterocyclic amines .
However , no studies exist yet that show how or why .
These here are five different organizations that classify carcinogens .
And I was led to it through a series of events .
So I was very surprised about this .
Based on these findings , I have a question for you .
Is it worth it to you ?
How will you cook your chicken now ?
Shree Bose : Hi everyone . I &apos;m Shree Bose .
Sounds ridiculous , right .
But that was me years ago .
And that was my first science fair project .
It got a bit more complicated from there .
Good plan .
Got rejected by all except one .
And that is where the research began .
One in 100 will die from it .
Sounds great , right ?
And this time , they no longer respond to the drug .
It &apos;s a huge problem .
So that &apos;s what we set out to do .
And that &apos;s huge .
But my work wasn &apos;t just about the research .
It was about finding my passion .
Thank you .
1.6 million deaths worldwide .
One death every 20 seconds .
People spend over 90 percent of their lives indoors .
They &apos;re everywhere .
I &apos;m going to show it to you on my laptop .
And this can be used by anyone .
And this report really drives home the crux of my research .
Stop the use of incense and candles .
Because remember , we spend 90 percent of our lives indoors .
Thank you .
Lisa Ling : Right .
Can I have Shree and Lauren come up really quickly ?
Your Google Science Fair champions .
Your winners .
Yang Lan : The generation that &apos;s remaking China
Guess who was the performing guest ?
Susan Boyle .
It means &quot; green onion for free . &quot;
Why did she say that ?
That was hilarious .
Well , being different is not that difficult .
We are all different from different perspectives .
You may have the chance to make a difference .
I thought I kind of offended them .
But actually , they were impressed by my words .
So I was on a national television prime-time show .
So we do a lot of things .
I &apos;ve interviewed more than a thousand people in the past .
I was in Beijing &apos;s bidding for the Olympic Games .
I was representing the Shanghai Expo .
I saw China embracing the world and vice versa .
It &apos;s very complicated to explain .
But anyway , the public still doesn &apos;t buy it .
It is still boiling .
On Tencent , 200 million .
So how are they different ?
Most of them have fairly good education .
In cities , 80 percent of kids go to college .
So making a living is not that easy for young people .
College graduates are not in short supply .
But they died because of all different personal reasons .
These diagrams show a more general social background .
The Gini coefficient has already passed the dangerous line of 0.4 .
We heard about polluted air , polluted water , poisoned food .
And guess what , we have faked beef .
China is soon to pass the U.S.
They &apos;re not rich at all .
And also , people are doing good through social media .
And after hours of negotiation , 500 dogs were rescued .
And here also people are helping to find missing children .
A father posted his son &apos;s picture onto the Internet .
I guess these are the questions people are going to answer .
Thank you very much .
Bruno Maisonnier : Dance , tiny robots !
Stefan Sagmeister : The power of time off
I run a design studio in New York .
We are totally closed .
And I get , over time , bored by them .
So I decided to close it down for one year .
That &apos;s clearly enjoyable for myself .
And they rang very true for me .
I likely already look forward to the weekend on Thursdays .
And I probably will need a hobby as a leveling mechanism .
In a career I &apos;m definitely more engaged .
I had spent my first sabbatical in New York City .
Looked for something different for the second one .
It &apos;s a wonderful , very craft-oriented society .
There is wonderful inspiration coming from the area itself .
So we created this series of 99 portraits on tee shirts .
Every single dog on one tee shirt .
And then just leave it all to them .
And I don &apos;t have to do anything .
So I looked for furniture .
It &apos;s not quite finished yet .
It &apos;s called Be Here Now .
It includes 330 compasses .
Then this is a fairly talkative , verbose kind of chair .
So I will not really go too far into it .
His restaurant is open seven months every year .
His latest numbers are fairly impressive .
And he has 2.2 million requests for reservations .
There is some good successes .
Anybody in here has actually ever conducted a sabbatical ?
That &apos;s about five percent of everybody .
Talk to them about if it was successful or not .
Sending mail to Japanese design magazines and things like that .
So I became my own intern .
Was not very successful . And so on and so forth .
What came out of it ?
I really got close to design again .
I had fun .
And I understood that the building itself was a logo .
So then it became quite easy .
That &apos;s connected to a scanner .
You put any image in there , like that Beethoven image .
So it will always fit together , conceptually , of course .
There is a full-blown orchestra living inside the building .
It has a more transparent identity .
The truck they go on tour with .
You can take the shape and make typography out of it .
You can grow it underneath the skin .
On one hand I have nothing against selling .
My parents are both salespeople .
There must be something else .
And the whole series of work came out of it .
Some of you might have seen it .
I &apos;ll just show two now .
It says , &quot; Self-confidence produces fine results . &quot;
This is after a week .
These are some pictures visitors sent to me .
That &apos;s the police , getting rid of it all .
It &apos;s a movie about happiness .
They weren &apos;t quite slick enough .
And I think she overdid it .
Just a bit too ornamental .
And my studio is very close to the monkey forest .
So we asked those guys to do it again .
So it &apos;s going to be a while .
Then you can of course always go and see this guy .
And I &apos;m happy I &apos;m alive .
Stefan Sagmeister : Thank you .
Kakenya Ntaiya : A girl who demanded school
There &apos;s a group of people in Kenya .
People cross oceans to go see them .
These people are tall .
They jump high . They wear red .
And they kill lions .
You might be wondering , who are these people ?
These are the Maasais .
The Maasais , the boys are brought up to be warriors .
The girls are brought up to be mothers .
Cool , yeah ?
Why did she say that ?
My father worked as a policeman in the city .
He came home once a year .
We didn &apos;t see him for sometimes even two years .
And whenever he came home , it was a different case .
When I went to school , I had a dream .
I wanted to become a teacher .
Teachers looked nice .
They wear nice dresses , high-heeled shoes .
So I wanted to become a teacher .
This was the crossroad .
I did . The ceremony happened .
It &apos;s a whole week long of excitement .
It &apos;s a ceremony . People are enjoying it .
They were all in a circle .
And I sat down , and I opened my legs .
As you can imagine , I bled . I bled .
After bleeding for a while , I fainted thereafter .
We were taken care of .
Well , while I was in high school , something happened .
There is something about clothes , I think , and shoes .
Don &apos;t you have a husband waiting for you ? &quot;
Just tell me how to get there . &quot;
This gentleman , he helped me .
I got a scholarship but I needed to get myself here .
&quot; My child , what are you doing here ? &quot;
They all came together .
I found snow !
I was in a land of plenty .
I learned that it was against the law in Kenya .
I learned that my mom had a right to own property .
Those things made me angry .
I wanted to do something .
I had to do something .
Because there had not been any school for girls .
She &apos;s beaten .
That made sense . And they agreed .
We have .
And yes , she was older to be in fourth grade .
We gave her the opportunity to come to the class .
Five months later , that is Angeline .
A transformation had begun in her life .
She was not the top student when we took her .
That &apos;s Sharon . That &apos;s five years later .
One hundred twenty-five girls are creating and achieving their dreams .
I want to challenge you today .
You are somebody who is so passionate .
You are somebody who wants to see a better world .
You are somebody who wants to make a difference .
You are somebody who wants to make our tomorrow better .
Be the first . People will follow you .
Be bold . Stand up . Be fearless . Be confident .
Ravin Agrawal : 10 young Indian artists to watch
The first is Bharti Kher .
I , for one , was steeped in these .
And she uses this vocabulary in her installation work as well .
He also creates phantasmagoric sculptures made of bones from cast resin .
He &apos;s putting a contemporary spin on the miniature tradition .
Raqib Shaw is Kolkata-born , Kashmir-raised , and London-trained .
He too is reinventing the miniature tradition .
Thank you very much for looking and listening .
Dyan deNapoli : The great penguin rescue
And I could not disagree more .
And these are two of the penguins &apos; main breeding islands .
Now at the time , I was working down the street .
I was a penguin aquarist at the New England Aquarium .
And with that call , my life would change forever .
And the scene inside of this building was devastating and surreal .
In fact , many people compared it to a war zone .
And this is what happened .
I was instantly transported back to that moment in time .
Penguins are very vocal birds and really , really noisy .
We just did not know .
And you may notice they &apos;re wearing very thick gloves .
And there really were no good solutions .
And luckily , the day they arrived , it was .
So this alone was a huge victory .
And we used this technique again during the Treasure rescue .
But an interesting thing was noted during the training process .
So penguins learn from previous experience , too .
But part way through , they ran out .
So what happened to those 20,000 oiled penguins ?
And was Silvia Gaus right ?
Well she could not be more wrong .
So what did I learn from this intense and unforgettable experience ?
And I learned that one person can make a huge difference .
Just look at that 17 year-old .
Well , you should care because they &apos;re an indicator species .
Thank you .
Paul Zak : Trust , morality -- and oxytocin ?
Is there anything unique about human beings ?
There is .
We &apos;re the only creatures with fully developed moral sentiments .
We &apos;re obsessed with morality as social creatures .
And I personally am obsessed with morality .
I want to know if there &apos;s a chemistry of morality .
I want to know if there was a moral molecule .
After 10 years of experiments , I found it .
This little syringe contains the moral molecule .
It &apos;s called oxytocin .
It can &apos;t be that important . &quot;
There must be a reason why . &quot;
But he was right , it was a stupid idea .
But it was testably stupid .
Turns out it wasn &apos;t so easy .
First of all , oxytocin is a shy molecule .
I think I can do that .
Then I had to measure morality .
So I started smaller .
I studied one single virtue : trustworthiness .
So poor countries are by and large low trust countries .
But I &apos;m also a skeptic .
So instead I use the Jerry Maguire approach to research .
If you &apos;re so virtuous , show me the money .
Let me show you how we do that .
So we recruit some people for an experiment .
They all get $ 10 if they agree to show up .
Then we match them in pairs by computer .
You only do it one time .
You &apos;re going to make them a lot wealthier .
So think about this experiment for minute .
So this was the birth of vampire economics .
Make a decision and give me some blood .
They assumed money is good , why not keep it all ?
That &apos;s not what we found .
But why ?
So we have a biology of trustworthiness .
But wait . What &apos;s wrong with this experiment ?
Two things .
One is that nothing in the body happens in isolation .
I didn &apos;t know for sure oxytocin caused trustworthiness .
And I found I could do it with a nasal inhaler .
Using the oxytocin inhaler , we ran more studies .
We showed it increases donations to charity by 50 percent .
We &apos;ve also investigated non-pharmacologic ways to raise oxytocin .
These include massage , dancing and praying .
Yes , my mom was happy about that last one .
But why do they do this ?
The change in oxytocin predicted their feelings of empathy .
So it &apos;s empathy that makes us connect to other people .
It &apos;s empathy that makes us help other people .
It &apos;s empathy that makes us moral .
Now this idea is not new .
So I tend to avoid that .
So I tend to do those things .
I just found the molecule behind it .
In particular , it tells us why we see immorality .
Opens it up and there &apos;s a pearl necklace inside .
&quot; Well this is very valuable .
I said , &quot; Pearl necklace ? &quot; &quot; Yeah . &quot;
&quot; Hey , a guy just found it . &quot;
Tell that guy to wait half an hour .
Get yourself a fat reward . Life &apos;s good . &quot;
He said , &quot; I can &apos;t do it .
I &apos;m in high school . I have no idea .
Now we know what happens .
So who are these people who manipulate our oxytocin systems ?
We call them bastards .
These are not people you want to have a beer with .
They have many of the attributes of psychopaths .
Now there are other ways the system can be inhibited .
One is through improper nurturing .
You need enough nurturing for this system to develop properly .
Also , high stress inhibits oxytocin .
So we , in experiments , have administered testosterone to men .
And instead of sharing money , they become selfish .
And we have testosterone .
It &apos;s all inside of us .
Yeah , I &apos;ve been worrying about that too .
So last summer , I attended a wedding in Southern England .
200 people in this beautiful Victorian mansion .
I didn &apos;t know a single person .
And I drove up in my rented Vauxhall .
And guess what ?
Who is the center of the wedding solar system ?
The bride .
She had the biggest increase in oxytocin .
Who loves the wedding almost as much as the bride ?
Her mother , that &apos;s right .
Her mother was number two .
And there are so many ways we can connect to people .
For example , through social media .
Many people are Tweeting right now .
So I ran this experiment recently for the Korean Broadcasting System .
And they had the reporters and their producers participate .
I mean , astounding ; no one has this .
So he was using social media in private .
They checked .
He was interacting on his girlfriend &apos;s Facebook page .
There you go . That &apos;s connection .
There are 800 different languages in the highlands .
These are the most primitive people in the world .
And they indeed also release oxytocin .
So oxytocin connects us to other people .
Oxytocin makes us feel what other people feel .
Let me show it to you .
Come here . Give me a hug .
There you go .
We have found that people who release more oxytocin are happier .
Dr. Love says eight hugs a day .
Thank you .
Rebecca Saxe : How we read each other &apos;s minds
I think novelists put this best .
Obviously the whole project here is huge .
This is a picture of it .
It &apos;s called the Right Temporo-Parietal Junction .
It &apos;s above and behind your right ear .
So this brain region is called the Right TPJ .
They &apos;re MIT undergraduates .
It takes children a long time to break into the system .
And you know what pirates really like ?
What ? RS : Pirates really like cheese sandwiches .
Cheese ? I love cheese !
I really love cheese sandwiches . &quot;
And so Ivan goes to get a drink .
And now , here comes the other pirate .
This pirate is called Joshua .
And Joshua also really loves cheese sandwiches .
So , that one is his .
RS : That one is Joshua &apos;s . That &apos;s right .
And then his went on the ground .
RS : That &apos;s exactly right .
So he won &apos;t know which one is his .
So which one do you think Ivan is going to take ?
I think he is going to take that one .
Oh yeah , you were right . He took that one .
Which sandwich is he going to take ?
Let &apos;s see what he does . Here comes Ivan .
And he says , &quot; I want my cheese sandwich . &quot;
And he takes this one .
Uh-oh . Why did he take that one ?
His was on the grass .
So the three-year-old does two things differently .
So that &apos;s why he &apos;s taking the other sandwich .
Now of course , development doesn &apos;t end at five .
So first I &apos;m going to show you the three-year-old again .
Yeah .
Yeah .
But now I &apos;m going to show you the five-year-old .
Remember the five-year-old completely understood why Ivan took Joshua &apos;s sandwich .
Um , yeah .
No , because the wind should get in trouble .
But it &apos;s not quite like the adult brain .
And I &apos;m going to give that to you now .
And Grace &apos;s friend asks for some sugar in her coffee .
And she puts it in her friend &apos;s coffee .
And her friend drinks the coffee , and is fine .
Okay . Good .
Now she thinks the powder is sugar .
And we do have such a tool .
It &apos;s called Trans-Cranial Magnetic Stimulation , or TMS .
So I &apos;m going to show you a demo of this .
When you hear clicks , we &apos;re turning the machine on .
So there is no physical force , just a magnetic pulse .
Woman : Ready , Rebecca ? RS : Yes .
It &apos;s getting them wrong that is living .
Thank you .
RS : I &apos;m not .
They really are calling ?
RS : Yeah , we worry about this .
One is that you can &apos;t be TMSed without knowing it .
So it &apos;s not a surreptitious technology .
We changed their ability to judge other people &apos;s actions .
RS : That &apos;s one of the idealistic hopes .
But why does anyone have to feel anything ?
You &apos;re a brilliant young neuroscientist .
Why ?
Scott Fraser : Why eyewitnesses get it wrong
And the car sped off .
The police , investigating officers , were amazingly efficient .
That &apos;s the shooter I saw that killed the father . &quot;
So what &apos;s wrong ?
Straightforward , fair trial , full investigation .
Oh yes , no gun was ever found .
And Mr. Carrillo &apos;s alibi ?
So what &apos;s the problem ?
We know that eyewitness identifications are fallible .
It &apos;s called reconstructed memories .
Well , what &apos;s that got to do with this ?
Take all the measurements and record them , right ?
The teenagers said they could see very well .
As you can see , it is at best poor .
Their eyes just glaze over , all right ?
A shocker in American jurisprudence .
He pointed by , and this is what the judge saw .
This is the car 30 feet away from the judge .
That &apos;s 30 feet away .
Okay . There &apos;s 15 feet .
At this point , I became a little concerned .
I couldn &apos;t see the slightest bend of his head .
And that &apos;s what he saw .
And this is three to four feet away .
Why did I take the risk ?
This is what he saw .
Which they decided not to .
He is now a freed man .
This is him embracing his grandmother-in-law .
The opposing council always fight it and oppose it .
Think about how we select our judges in this country .
It &apos;s very different than most other cultures . All right ?
We all have to be very careful .
All our memories are reconstructed memories .
They &apos;re dynamic .
Thank you .
Doris Kim Sung : Metal that breathes
He said that it would overheat the engine .
That &apos;s the first line of defense for the body .
And this gets me back to my research .
This last project is also of components .
And grasshoppers have a different kind of breathing system .
Sheila Nirenberg : A prosthetic eye to treat blindness
It &apos;s really our first foray into this .
It &apos;s the development of a prosthetic device for treating blindness .
So let me start in on that problem .
There are 10 million people in the U.S.
Here you have a retina .
Anyway , you get the idea .
So no other device has been able to do this .
How important is this ?
This is just actually the first one that we tried .
I just wanted to say something about the standard method .
Jonathan Harris : The web as art
So I &apos;ll be talking about each of those today .
So , I started collecting found objects .
Have fun in whatever you do . &quot;
One such project is about a year and a half old .
It &apos;s called &quot; We Feel Fine . &quot;
This is , then , how they &apos;re presented .
&quot; I feel good . &quot;
So the next movement is called mobs .
This provides a slightly more statistical look at things .
You can also stop a raindrop and open the feeling inside .
These are the images that are automatically constructed .
&quot; I can feel my cancer grow . &quot;
&quot; I feel pretty . &quot;
&quot; I feel skinny , but I &apos;m not . &quot;
&quot; I feel sassy . &quot;
&quot; I feel so sexy in this new wig . &quot;
Sometimes , stories as short as two or three words .
The first such one is called &quot; The Whale Hunt . &quot;
I photographed that entire experience at five-minute intervals .
So every five minutes , I took a photograph .
When I was awake , with the camera around my neck .
When I was sleeping , with a tripod and a timer .
That was the first concept here .
What are the things that make up a story ?
So , stories have characters . Stories have concepts .
Stories take place in a certain area . They have contexts .
They have colors . What do they look like ?
We &apos;re very used to this .
So these are all 3,214 pictures taken up there .
These are organized chronologically .
That &apos;s &quot; Moby Dick . &quot;
This is the food we ate .
Cigarette break outside -- I don &apos;t smoke .
This is a really exciting sequence of me sleeping .
This is out at whale camp , on the Arctic Ocean .
And you can see Rony cutting up the whale here .
It &apos;s baleen . Moving on .
And it leads to just a completely different value system .
This is an 11-year-old student .
His wish was to become a police officer .
He was getting started early . Those were his hands .
A 28-year-old cell phone shop owner .
He wanted to help poor people .
She wanted to keep farming until she dies .
A 16-year-old quarry worker .
A 21-year-old monk . He was very happy .
He wanted to live a long life at the monastery .
He was kind of too shy to make a funny face .
A 16-year-old student .
She wanted to become an independent woman .
A 24-year-old truck driver .
Her wish was to marry someone with a car .
She wanted a change in her life .
An 81-year-old itinerant farmer .
It was all good-natured .
A 10-year-old .
A 37-year-old road worker .
His wish was to make some money and open a store .
Finally , this is a 26-year-old nun I spoke to .
Her wish was to make a pilgrimage to Tibet .
And this is what she said .
Jonathan Harris : Maybe you &apos;ll die ? Yes .
JH : Are you hoping to ?
Ah , because you know , it &apos;s impermanent .
But I prefer for maybe 40 to 50 .
JH : 40 to 50 ? Yeah .
Yes . From then , I &apos;m going to the heaven .
Thank you .
So thank you again , so much .
You &apos;re most welcome .
And they &apos;re actually still flying up there today .
You can start to see some familiar balloons here .
Thanks very much .
Beau Lotto : So , this game is very simple .
All right . One , two , three .
Audience : What are you reading ?
What are you reading ? There are no words there .
I said , read what you &apos;re seeing . Right ?
It &apos;s because perception is grounded in our experience .
Ow ! Ow !
But we &apos;re talking about perception here , right ?
They begin with a question .
The problem with questions is they create uncertainty .
Okay ?
Even seasickness is a consequence of uncertainty .
So what is evolution &apos;s answer to the problem of uncertainty ?
It &apos;s play .
Science is not defined by the method section of a paper .
That &apos;s actually what an experiment is .
And who better to ask than 25 eight- to 10-year-old children ?
The first step was to ask a question .
So we did it anyway . Right ? Of course .
So they were asking questions that were significant to expert scientists .
Now , science and asking questions is about courage .
So Amy , would you please come up ?
Student : There &apos;s two up there .
And three in here .
The one on the left is mine , okay ?
The introduction says , what &apos;s the question and why ?
And the discussion is , who cares ? Right ?
That &apos;s a science paper , basically .
All the ones in bold are eight to 10 years old .
The work would be publishable if done by adults . &quot;
They say no .
What was the feedback like ?
It &apos;s forever freely accessible by Biology Letters .
And I &apos;ll just read one .
What you guys have done is real , true and amazing .
Who else can have these qualities more than children ?
Please congratulate your children &apos;s team from my side . &quot;
So I &apos;d like to conclude with a physical metaphor .
Can I do it on you ?
And you like technology , right ?
Shimon Schocken : Right , but I like myself .
This is the epitome of technology . Right . Okay .
Now ...
Okay .
Everyone over there shout .
Where &apos;s the sound coming from ?
Thank you very much .
So , Amy ?
Thank you . Thank you very much .
Catarina Mota : Play with smart materials
Let me show you some examples .
And thermochromic pigments change color at a given temperature .
Well first of all , because I am a maker .
Smart materials are hard to obtain in small quantities .
But that &apos;s not always the case .
Thank you .
Wadah Khanfar : A historic moment in the Arab world
Ten years ago exactly , I was in Afghanistan .
These regimes created something within us during this period .
I &apos;m 43 years old right now .
And this is why they revolted .
This is why they did not accept .
Would you like to see civil war , sectarian killing ?
Would you like to see destruction ?
Would you like to see foreign troops on your land ? &quot;
That was one of the worst nightmares that we have seen .
Nothing happened . No violence . Nothing .
This is what happened in Tunisia .
The intelligence agencies wanted to arrest people .
They found something called Facebook .
They found something called Twitter .
They were surprised by all of these kinds of issues .
And they said , &quot; These kids are misled . &quot;
This is what they were telling . This is their propaganda .
&quot; Bring these kids home because they are misled . &quot;
Parents actually went to the streets and they supported them .
And this is how the revolution was born in Tunisia .
We are going to be the voice for these voiceless people .
We are going to spread the message .
And then Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali decided to leave .
And then Egypt started , and Hosni Mubarak decided to leave .
And now Libya as you see it .
And then you have Yemen .
In front of Al Jazeera , they started creating tribalism .
They started telling the West , &quot; Be aware of Al-Qaeda .
Al-Qaeda is taking over our territories .
These are Islamists trying to create new Imaras .
Fortunately , people right now cannot be deceived .
They have lost .
Al Jazeera is not a tool of revolution .
We do not create revolutions .
Let us accept the choice of the people .
Let us support these people .
Let us stand for them .
The future has arrived , and the future is now .
I thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
I just have a couple of questions for you .
Thank you for coming here .
How would you characterize the historical significance of what &apos;s happened ?
Is this a story-of-the-year , a story-of-the-decade or something more ?
We have covered many wars .
You are witnessing change in history .
You are witnessing the birth of a new era .
And this is what the story &apos;s all about .
Fifty percent of it is coming from America .
They &apos;ve had some speakers there .
I believe they &apos;ve heard your talk .
Thank you for inspiring them and for inspiring all of us .
Thank you so much .
Sebastião Salgado : The silent drama of photography
A marvelous place .
Very few things went to the market .
There I learned different things .
I &#91; went to &#93; university to become an economist .
I &#91; did &#93; a master &apos;s degree in economics .
Brazil radicalized very strongly .
I worked after for an investment bank .
And one day photography made a total invasion in my life .
But I did much more than that .
I put photography as my life .
It became a book . It became a show .
I saw in Rwanda total brutality .
I saw deaths by thousands per day .
I lost my faith in our species .
I started to have infection everywhere .
You must stop . Stop .
And I made the decision to stop .
It was a big coincidence .
It was the moment that my parents became very old .
You say that you were born in paradise .
Let &apos;s build the paradise again .
We transformed . We gave this land back to nature .
It became a national park .
We must protect the forest in this sense .
But we create an incredible contradiction .
To build all this , we destroy a lot .
Around here , no ? The redwood forests are gone .
Gone very fast , disappeared .
India has no more trees . Spain has no more trees .
And we must rebuild these forests .
That is the essence of our life , these forests .
A lack of oxygen in the water .
For the water system , the trees are essential .
The trees are the hair of our planet .
When you have trees , the root system holds the water .
But you see a lot of small spots in this picture .
There are thousands of trees .
And I &apos;ll show you the last picture .
We are with two million trees in the ground now .
We can apply it everywhere around the world , no ?
And I believe that we can do it together .
Thank you very much .
Catherine Mohr : The tradeoffs of building green
First of all , I &apos;m a geek .
And so I have to figure this out for myself .
For example : Is this evil ?
But can I use a paper towel ?
The answer to this can be found in embodied energy .
Wipe it up , throw it away .
This is now operating energy .
Well , now a paper towel looks better .
Screw the paper towels . Let &apos;s go to a sponge .
And now all bets are off .
That &apos;s what my husband and I are doing right now .
We wanted to know how much better we could do .
So first , we demolish it .
And then we poured a big foundation for passive solar .
We then put in framing .
And yet , all the press is focused on that .
Except for flooring .
So what does this mean ?
But my elephant in the living room flies .
Clearly , I need to walk home from TED .
But all the calculations for embodied energy are on the blog .
Thank you .
Clayton Cameron : A-rhythm-etic . The math behind the beats
How many of you love rhythm ?
Oh yeah , oh yeah . Oh yeah .
I mean , I love all kinds of rhythm .
Can you repeat after me ? A-rhythm-etic . Audience : A-rhythm-etic .
Clayton Cameron : A-rhythm-etic . Audience : A-rhythm-etic .
CC : A-rhythm a-rhythm . Audience : A-rhythm a-rhythm .
CC : A-rhythm-etic . Audience : A-rhythm-etic .
CC : Yeah .
What ?
Yeah . Three is a magic number .
Three is a groovin &apos; number .
Three is a hip-hop kind of number .
But what does subdividing by three mean ?
And counting off by four ?
Well , look , think of it this way .
A measure of music as a dollar .
Now a dollar has four quarters , right ?
And so does a 4 / 4 measure of music .
It has four quarter notes .
Now , how do you subdivide ?
All : A-one-two-three-four , one-two-three-four , one-two-three-four .
CC : Okay , now you feel that ?
And listen to this .
A-one-two-three-four , one-two-three-four , one-two-three-four , with me .
One-two-three-four , one-two-three , come on , y &apos;all !
All : One-two-three-four , one-two-three-four , one-two-three-four , ah .
CC : There you go .
All right , second line .
One-two-three-four , one-two-three .
One-two-three-four , one-two-three .
One-two-three-four , one-two-three .
One-two-three-four , one-two-three . Yeah .
Now , that &apos;s what I call a-rhythm-etic .
Can you say it ? A-rhythm-etic . Audience : A-rhythm-etic .
CC : A-rhythm-etic . Audience : A-rhythm-etic .
CC : A-rhythm a-rhythm . Audience : A-rhythm a-rhythm .
CC : A-rhythm-etic . Audience : A-rhythm-etic .
One , two , one , two , a-one-two-three-four .
Yeah . Mm .
One-two-three , one-two-three , one-two-three , one-two-three . Whoo .
Aha .
A-rhythm-etic . Audience : A-rhythm-etic .
CC : A-rhythm-etic . Audience : A-rhythm-etic .
CC : A-rhythm a-rhythm . Audience : A-rhythm a-rhythm .
CC : A-rhythm-etic . Audience : A-rhythm-etic .
CC : Yeah . Hip-hop .
Triplet-triplet . Say it with me .
All : Triplet-triplet .
CC : Triplet-triplet . Triplet-triplet .
A-rhythm-etic .
Daniel Wolpert : The real reason for brains
I &apos;m a neuroscientist .
There is no other reason to have a brain .
Think about it .
So I am a movement chauvinist .
Think about the game of chess .
How well are we doing determining what piece to move where ?
That problem is solved .
There &apos;s no competition at all .
So it &apos;s a very simple algorithm .
But let me show you cutting-edge robotics .
Now we can compare this to cutting-edge human performance .
And this is her getting the world record in real time .
And she &apos;s pretty happy .
And it sounds like an easy problem .
You send a command down , it causes muscles to contract .
Now by noise , I do not mean sound .
You have a huge spread due to movement variability .
The teapot could be full , it could be empty .
It changes over time .
So let &apos;s think about the inference .
You want to generate beliefs about the world .
So what are beliefs ?
Beliefs could be : where are my arms in space ?
Am I looking at a cat or a fox ?
But we &apos;re going to represent beliefs with probabilities .
And numbers in between give you the gray levels of uncertainty .
You have data , and data in neuroscience is sensory input .
You accumulate knowledge throughout your life in memories .
And I &apos;ve put the formula up there .
And it has real beauty and real explanatory power .
So let me give you an intuitive example .
There are two sources of information Bayes &apos; rule tells you .
Now both these sources of information carry important information .
So it &apos;s the optimal way of combining information .
And what it means is we really are Bayesian inference machines .
But you can imagine looking inside the brain .
And here &apos;s inside the brain .
Well why would I bother doing that ?
I &apos;m going to get the same feedback anyway .
Well there &apos;s good reasons .
So I get two sources .
Any discrepancy should hopefully be external .
Everything left over is external to me .
What evidence is there for this ?
I &apos;ll show you just one part of our study .
The left hand always is the same and puts sinusoidal tickle .
All we &apos;re playing with is a tempo causality .
And in the intervening years I had two daughters .
It quickly escalates .
They predict the sensory consequences and subtract it off .
So we decided to test this in the lab .
And the game is very simple .
Use your other hand to apply the force back down .
But we &apos;ve got a problem .
So it could be bridged in infinitely many different ways .
So think about just a point to point movement .
So I have a huge amount of choice to make .
Now it turns out , we are extremely stereotypical .
We all move the same way pretty much .
Now this is a bunch of dots moving .
Well let &apos;s think about what really happens .
Maybe we don &apos;t all quite move the same way .
Maybe there &apos;s variation in the population .
So in evolutionary scales , movements get better .
And perhaps in life , movements get better through learning .
Imagine I want to intercept this ball .
Here are two possible paths to that ball .
But there &apos;s noise added to this .
So you want to avoid big forces as one principle .
But it &apos;s also relevant for disease and rehabilitation .
There are many diseases which effect movement .
Thank you very much .
Quick question for you , Dan .
So you &apos;re a movement -- -- chauvinist .
Well that was quite fascinating . Thank you very much indeed .
John La Grou : A plug for smart power outlets
This is a world-changing invention .
But smoke alarms don &apos;t prevent fires .
What if we could prevent electrical fires before they start ?
So how does electricity ignite residential fires ?
Our invention had to address all of these issues .
So what about circuit breakers ?
Well , Thomas Edison invented the circuit breaker in 1879 .
Hmmm ...
Now , every home electrical system becomes an intelligent network .
The appliance &apos;s safe operating parameters are embedded into its plug .
We call this technology EFCI , Electrical Fault Circuit Interrupter .
There are 10 billion electrical outlets in North America alone .
The potential energy savings is very , very significant .
So far we &apos;ve applied for 414 patent claims .
Thank you .
Erica Frenkel : The universal anesthesia machine
I study health systems in these countries .
In the background there is a very sophisticated anesthesia machine .
It &apos;s a pretty expensive machine .
This is the electrical supply for a hospital in rural Malawi .
Those machines go the proverbial junkyard .
It &apos;s not just inappropriate , it becomes really unsafe .
And everything began pretty auspiciously .
The surgeon was on call and scrubbed in .
The nurse was there .
And everything began well until the power went out .
Because her machine doesn &apos;t work when there &apos;s no power .
35 million surgeries are attempted every year without safe anesthesia .
My colleague , Dr. Paul Fenton , was living this reality .
There has to be something better . &quot;
Voila !
Here she is .
There &apos;s a built-in oxygen concentrator down there .
Everything else is the same .
But we &apos;ve put a long-life battery backup on here .
This is the only part that &apos;s battery backed up .
And so we &apos;ve just added this manual bellows .
So it &apos;s a straightforward machine .
I shudder to say simple ; it &apos;s straightforward .
And it &apos;s by design .
This is an incredibly rugged machine .
And finally , it &apos;s affordable .
But we &apos;re not content to stop there .
Is it working ?
Is this the design that &apos;s going to work in place ?
Well we &apos;ve seen good results so far .
So we &apos;re thrilled .
They have a really cool anesthesia simulation lab out in Baltimore .
Who gets surgery and who doesn &apos;t ?
Who gets safe surgery and who doesn &apos;t ?
Thank you very much .
Eric Berlow : Simplifying complexity
All the grayed-out species disappear .
Some are actually on the brink of extinction .
This is a diagram of the U.S. counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan .
Instantly ridiculed by the media for being so crazy complicated .
Clearly a complex problem , but is it complicated ?
I can sink my teeth into this . &quot;
Because simple answers may emerge .
Thank you .
Nick Veasey : Exposing the invisible
That image was the start of the X-ray technology .
And I &apos;m still fundamentally using the same principles today .
I &apos;m interpreting it in a more contemporary manner .
And the bus is full of people .
But everyone on that bus is Frieda .
Fairly obvious what that is .
We all look the same inside , believe me .
The creases in the material and the sort of nuances .
I peel back the layers and expose it .
And I &apos;m sure Ross can associate that with design .
The design comes from within .
So , that &apos;s an empty parka jacket .
But I quite love the way it &apos;s posed .
Nature is my greatest inspiration .
An amaryllis flower looking really three-dimensional .
Seaweed , ebbing in the tide .
This is my new , purpose-built , X-ray shed .
is made of lead and steel .
The walls are 700 millimeters thick of solid dense concrete .
So , I &apos;m using quite a lot of radiation .
So , still working with film , I &apos;m afraid .
They scan each individual X-ray .
And this shows how I do my process of same-size X-rays .
So , this is , again , my daughter &apos;s dress .
But there are four X-ray plates .
You can see them overlapping .
In fact , that is three months solid X-raying .
There is over 500 separate components .
Boeing sent me a 747 in containers .
And I sent them back an X-ray .
I kid you not .
Okay , so Frieda is my dead skeleton .
This , unfortunately , is basically two pictures .
The one on the left is an x-ray .
But this time I had to use a real body .
So , here I had to use a recently deceased body .
And getting a hold of that was extremely difficult and laborious .
But people do donate their bodies to art and science .
And when they do , I &apos;m in the queue .
So , I like to use them .
The coloring , so coloring adds another level to the X-rays .
It makes it more organic , more natural .
It &apos;s whatever takes my fancy , really .
But I just like it in bright orange .
It makes a two dimensional image look more three dimensional .
The thing in there is very dangerous .
It &apos;s cumulative .
It has human connotations .
And it &apos;s just a bit spooky .
Because it transfers food from its roots to its leaves .
Look at this monster .
It &apos;s so basic . It just grows wild .
It &apos;s just happening .
And the X-ray shows how beautiful nature can be .
So the X-ray will show the overlaps in these little corners .
The lighter the object , the less radiation .
So , these leaves at the edge would start to disappear .
Yeah , I &apos;m quite pleased with it .
And that &apos;s the sort of thing I &apos;ve been doing .
This is a commercial application of my most recent work .
Unfortunately I haven &apos;t got X-ray vision .
So , what am I doing in the future ?
And I think that would look quite neat as an X-ray .
And this is quite a good way of doing it .
I &apos;m also working now with X-ray video .
Ursus Wehrli : Tidying up art
First of all -- any questions so far ?
So the reading would be over very quickly .
You won &apos;t be familiar with it .
Yeah , I kind of felt sorry for him .
Yeah . And I think he looks now less miserable .
And I can show here a very good example .
It &apos;s a picture by Paul Klee .
Yeah , that &apos;s great .
So I mean , that &apos;s just tidying up for beginners .
What can you say ? What a mess .
And that &apos;s really advanced tidying up .
We are only happy when things are in order .
This is a picture by Joan Miro .
It &apos;s more economical and also more efficient .
I &apos;ll just quote from the specification .
I would like to do a short test with you .
Everyone is sitting in quite an orderly fashion here this morning .
One , two , three .
That &apos;s a picture by Keith Haring .
I think it doesn &apos;t matter .
This is Keith Haring looked at statistically .
One can obviously also make combinations .
You can add them to all the squares of Paul Klee .
But I think it could still benefit from more discipline .
And here , that &apos;s one of my favorites .
Tidying up Rene Magritte -- this is really fun .
And when I returned it looked like this .
Some people would make apple pie out of it .
Or you could go into three-dimensional art .
Here we have the fur cup by Meret Oppenheim .
Here I just brought it back to its original state .
And now they &apos;re all in here .
You can count them afterwards , if you like .
This is the village square by Pieter Bruegel .
That &apos;s how it looks like when you send everyone home .
I just piled them up .
And I started to bring some order into some flags .
And then maybe before I leave you ...
Thank you very much .
Ruby Wax : What &apos;s so funny about mental illness ?
You . Yeah .
With the weird teeth . And you next to him .
You know who you are .
Actually , that whole row isn &apos;t right .
I am one of the one in four . Thank you .
So how did it start ?
What am I going to talk about ? Okay .
&quot; Run like the wind , Veruca ! Run ! &quot;
Perk up .
Because I didn &apos;t think of that .
Here we go .
This little baby has a lot of horsepower .
It comes completely conscious . It &apos;s got state-of-the-art lobes .
I don &apos;t know if you can get that here .
Go figure .
We are not equipped for the 21st century .
Thank you very much . Thank you . Thank you .
Your pets are happier than you are .
Completely and utterly -- so , screwed .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Daniel Reisel : The neuroscience of restorative justice
Meet Joe .
Joe &apos;s 32 years old and a murderer .
I &apos;d like you to imagine this place .
It looks and feels like it sounds : Wormwood Scrubs .
These individuals have committed acts of unspeakable evil .
And I was there to study their brains .
What lay at the root of their behavior ?
Was there a neurological cause for their condition ?
Growing up , I was always intrigued by how people change .
I sat down .
The heavy metal door slammed shut behind me .
I looked at Joe .
And we looked at their physical response to those emotions .
They failed to show a physical response .
That turned out to be not such an easy task .
After some time , however , we had a tentative answer .
These individuals were not just the victims of a troubled childhood .
There was something else .
It is thought to be key to the experience of empathy .
So let &apos;s take a step back .
At first , this isn &apos;t perfect .
The early years are crucial .
That &apos;s not to say it &apos;s impossible .
So can brains change ?
The brain could only change within certain set limits .
That was the dogma .
The evidence is actually the other way .
One way such rehabilitation might work is through restorative justice programs .
So what can we do now ?
How can we apply this knowledge ?
In another decade , Joe will be released from Wormwood Scrubs .
Thank you .
Trita Parsi : Iran and Israel : Peace is possible
It &apos;s actually from Yitzhak Rabin .
The year is 1987 .
Yet , Rabin referred to Iran as a geostrategic friend .
A third of the Jewish population stayed in Babylonia .
They &apos;re today &apos;s Iraqi Jews .
A third migrated to Persia .
To defeat our policy of containment , not about ideology .
Tehran was not interested .
The Bush administration did not even respond .
All sides have never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity .
But this is not an ancient conflict .
This is not even an ideological conflict .
But some want war .
Who will risk peace ?
You make it with your enemies . &quot;
Thank you .
Laurie Garrett : Lessons from the 1918 flu
What is it that we &apos;re concerned about ?
And that means that your microbial hitchhikers are moving with you .
Indeed , an outbreak would be multiple Katrinas at once .
You &apos;ve heard about the vaccine we &apos;re stockpiling .
And of course it will be hugely disruptive in preparation plans .
For example , all masks are made in China .
So it turns out that shutting down the airports is counterproductive .
This is not your normal garden-variety flu .
Alright , so I &apos;ve got you nervous .
And we have spent a lot of money .
And 40 states already have an acute nursing shortage .
Add on pandemic threat , you &apos;re in big trouble .
So what have people been doing with this money ?
Exercises , drills , all over the world .
Let &apos;s pretend there &apos;s a pandemic .
Let &apos;s everybody run around and play your role .
Main result is that there is tremendous confusion .
Nobody knows the chain of command .
The rest is up to your local community .
Everything is about your town , where you live .
And you &apos;ll have massive competition .
Unfortunately it &apos;s made against the current form of H5N1 .
The vaccine will probably be useless .
So here &apos;s where the decisions come in .
You &apos;re the mayor of your local town .
What about quarantine ?
During the SARS epidemic in Beijing quarantine did seem to help .
We have no uniform policies regarding quarantine across the United States .
And some states have differential policies , county by county .
Encouraging telecommuting ? What works ?
Well the British government did a model of telecommuting .
Nobody was processing the credit cards .
Your insurance payments didn &apos;t go through .
And that &apos;s just office workers , bankers .
The Institute of Medicine tried to look at the masking question .
Or can we get away with some different kinds of masks ?
It wasn &apos;t flying microbes .
Russia has actually stockpiled enough for 95 percent of all Russians .
We &apos;ve stockpiled enough for 30 percent .
When I say enough , that &apos;s two weeks worth .
What do we know from 1918 , the last great pandemic ?
The federal government abdicated most responsibility .
Every city , county , state did their own thing .
And the rules and the belief systems were wildly disparate .
The second wave was the mutated , super-killer wave .
And in the first wave we had enough healthcare workers .
Overall we lost 700,000 people .
It was likened to the plague .
We don &apos;t actually know how many people died .
The low-ball estimate is 35 million .
This was based on European and North American data .
So are we ready ?
As a nation , no we &apos;re not .
What mask works , what mask doesn &apos;t work .
How many masks do you need ?
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s rational .
And right now most of the preparedness is deeply flawed .
And put the pressure where the pressure needs to be put .
But can you sustain your company that way ?
Well if you have a dot-com , maybe you can .
Otherwise you &apos;re in trouble .
Happy to take your questions .
Audience member : What factors determine the duration of a pandemic ?
But I would say that honestly we don &apos;t know .
But we don &apos;t really know how and why that happens .
It &apos;s a very complicated ecology .
Audience member : What kind of triggers are you looking for ?
You know way more than any of us .
Can you talk about that ?
But we do not completely understand why .
The mechanism isn &apos;t clear .
We have absolutely no idea what that would do .
I &apos;m thinking dipstick .
It tells you if you have H5N1 .
Is that likely , do you think , here ?
I mean 100 percent death rate is pretty severe .
What percentage of infected people were killed by it ?
Again we don &apos;t really know for sure .
But we don &apos;t really know .
We &apos;ve never seen anything even remotely like this before . &quot;
The whole immune system swarms into the lungs .
But it &apos;s not bacterial pneumonia .
Ian Ritchie : The day I turned down Tim Berners-Lee
So let &apos;s just run through these guys .
This is Vannevar Bush .
And the article was called &quot; As We May Think . &quot;
The brain works by association .
Now this was in 1945 .
And nobody knew anything about it .
So this was before the computer was invented .
And he proposed this machine called the memex .
He built a system .
And this is Doug Engelbart .
He had his head mic like I &apos;ve got .
And he works this system .
So this is where the mouse came from as well .
So this is Doug Engelbart .
And we delivered the world &apos;s first hypertext system .
And this began to get a head of steam .
The magazines started to cover it .
And our PC version became quite mature .
We called it hml : hypertext markup language .
So we didn &apos;t do it .
In 1992 , his paper was rejected for the Hypertext Conference .
So that puts me in pretty illustrious company .
But is he happy ?
Frans de Waal : Moral behavior in animals
This is me at an early age with a baby chimpanzee .
This is the launch of my book .
But why would you reconcile after a fight ?
That doesn &apos;t make any sense .
And so they also reconcile with sex .
But the principle is exactly the same .
And so deep down our nature &apos;s actually nasty .
I think it &apos;s a very unfair image for the wolf .
The wolf is , after all , a very cooperative animal .
So these are the pillars of morality .
these are the two factors that always come out .
And the other one is empathy and compassion .
And so they &apos;re absolutely essential .
So let me give you a few examples here .
And of course , there &apos;s food on the box .
Otherwise they wouldn &apos;t be pulling so hard .
And so they &apos;re bringing in the box .
And you can see that they &apos;re synchronized .
Now look at what happens at the very end of this .
He takes basically everything .
So there are two interesting parts about this .
And so that &apos;s how this all operates .
We do the same task with elephants .
Otherwise nothing is going to happen and the rope disappears .
The apparatus is on the left with food on it .
So it &apos;s actually fairly simple for them .
There they are .
And so that &apos;s how they bring it in .
But now we &apos;re going to make it more difficult .
So it &apos;s what we call freeloading .
But it shows the intelligence that the elephants have .
This was the cooperation , reciprocity part .
Now something on empathy .
Empathy is my main topic at the moment of research .
And empathy has sort of two qualities .
And the emotional part .
And so empathy has basically two channels .
One is the body channel .
Your average dog has that also .
And that &apos;s more limited .
Humans yawn when others yawn .
And it &apos;s related to empathy .
It activates the same areas in the brain .
So it is connected .
Now we also study more complex expressions . This is consolation .
That &apos;s consolation . It &apos;s very similar to human consolation .
And consolation behavior , it &apos;s empathy driven .
We also recently published an experiment you may have heard about .
Now we did a very simple experiment .
And so that &apos;s how they live .
In this case , we put two chimpanzees side-by-side .
So this is a study we did with Vicky Horner .
And here you have the two color tokens .
So they have a whole bucket full of them .
And they have to pick one of the two colors .
You will see how that goes .
The one on the left walks away because she knows already .
that this is not a good test for her .
Then the next one is the pro-social token .
So the one who makes the choices always gets a reward .
So it doesn &apos;t matter whatsoever .
And she should actually be choosing blindly .
But what we find is that they prefer the pro-social token .
And so this became a very famous study .
And we did that originally with capuchin monkeys .
But with Sarah Brosnan we started out with capuchin monkeys .
So what we did is we put two capuchin monkeys side-by-side .
So that &apos;s the experiment we did .
The one on the left is the monkey who gets cucumber .
The one on the right is the one who gets grapes .
The first piece she eats .
The other one needs to give a rock to us .
And that &apos;s what she does .
And she gets a grape and she eats it .
The other one sees that .
She tests a rock now against the wall .
She needs to give it to us .
And she gets cucumber again .
They didn &apos;t like this at all .
And I think philosophers need to rethink their philosophy for awhile .
So let me summarize .
I believe there &apos;s an evolved morality .
And I thank you for your attention .
Bertrand Piccard : My solar-powered adventure
And on the other side there was a rising sun .
And we have to resist to the changes .
We have to keep everything under control .
Well , the unknown is part of life .
And in that sense , ballooning is a beautiful metaphor .
How do we steer a balloon ?
But how do we do that ?
And when we drop the ballast overboard we climb .
And I think in life it should be exactly like this .
It &apos;s not true .
And when we are able to do that , what happens ?
This is very practical .
This can be in politics .
This can be in spirituality .
Because we will throw away these political dogmas .
Throwing overboard , as ballast , to change our direction .
But sometimes it &apos;s very paradoxical .
We fly twice the speed you predicted . &quot;
We don &apos;t have enough gas to fly so slow . &quot;
And this is why you need weathermen .
This is why you need people with long-term vision .
So , we went down actually .
And actually this is where the adventure really started .
We could land anytime and fly back home with an airplane .
That &apos;s a crisis .
And actually , we changed completely our flight plan .
We changed completely our strategy .
And after 20 days we landed successfully in Egypt .
We took off with 3.7 tons of liquid propane .
We landed with 40 kilos .
When I saw that , I made a promise to myself .
I had no idea how it was possible .
It allowed to do all those things there .
But it will not be possible in the future any more .
It takes too much energy . It will cost too much .
Pioneering spirit should continue , but on another level .
Well , solar power airplanes are not new .
For that , unfortunately , four meters wingspan is not enough .
You need 64 meter wingspan .
Why that ? Because fuel is not easy to replace .
That &apos;s for sure .
That means a Christmas tree , a big Christmas tree .
We have now 70 people in the team working on it .
That has been achieved after two years of work .
Cockpit , propeller , engine .
Just the fuselage here , it &apos;s so light .
50 kilos for the entire fuselage .
Couple of kilos more for the wing spars .
This is the complete structure of the airplane .
And one month ago we have unveiled it .
A real airplane that we could finally present .
And what &apos;s the goal now ?
And this is exactly the symbol of our world .
So , you see that this airplane is more a symbol .
So , we have to start , and show the example .
A little bit like on this picture here .
This is not an airplane .
This is acceptable .
Gian Giudice : Why our universe might exist on a knife-edge
It was a historical day .
Well , at least , here at CERN .
Too many questions are left unanswered .
Of course , the verdict is not definitive .
Let &apos;s see where this hypothesis is going to lead us .
Space-time underwent a phase transition .
But this story is far more interesting than that .
But let &apos;s go back to the Higgs field .
No molecular structures would be possible , no life .
So is this how humanity is going to disappear ?
I don &apos;t think so .
Even so , we will be long gone by then .
Theoretical physicists always ask &quot; why &quot; questions .
But I don &apos;t know if my hypothesis is right .
Thank you .
Simon Lewis : Don &apos;t take consciousness for granted
There was a time in my life when everything seemed perfect .
Everywhere I went , I felt at home .
This is where it began .
This is Los Angeles , California , where I live .
This is a police photo . That &apos;s actually my car .
Fifteen is a mild coma . Three is the deepest .
It &apos;s so unpredictable and so fragile .
And this is how we began .
We all began in the Awash Valley in Ethiopia .
But we don &apos;t . We take our consciousness for granted .
These are just some examples .
That statistic is so sad .
All of these represent gaps between potential mind and actual mind .
Our children are becoming depressed at an alarming rate .
If you look at some of these other items -- concussions .
Half of E.R. admissions from adolescents are for concussions .
The average teenager sends 3,300 texts every &#91; month &#93; .
I didn &apos;t feel empty ; I felt everything simultaneously .
But let &apos;s swivel around and look at me frontally .
But let &apos;s take a look behind my eyes .
Here &apos;s my brain .
The first C is cognitive training .
Let &apos;s just talk about full-scale I.Q.
And you can see here there are three columns .
Untestable -- that &apos;s when I &apos;m in my coma .
That &apos;s when I was discharged from the system .
What does average I.Q. really mean ?
Then I underwent cognitive training .
This is not supposed to occur .
And this person is particularly interesting .
But that person could be identified as having a learning disability .
Second aspect : I still had crushing migraine headaches .
The craniomandibular system is critical to that .
So my teeth actually hold my jaw in the correct position .
This affected my entire body .
That tiny misalignment .
Bear in mind , there are no nerves in the teeth .
I still had migraine headaches .
That &apos;s basically it .
Using this technology , this is mapping in three dimensions .
This is an MRI MRA MRV , a volumetric MRI .
Communication , the next C. This is critical .
All consciousness is about communication .
This is it being held in the hand .
It weighs less than a gram .
Five of them would still weigh less than a rupee coin .
Where does it go inside the body ?
So it goes in and it stays there .
Here are the implantation sites .
The main unit will then go inside the brain .
I don &apos;t have the ability to control my left foot .
Gradually , I remembered the protector was my wife .
I believe that we can all rise and shine .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t know what I had in my mind .
And he was walking around .
And we have his book outside in the bookshop .
So I think this one detail went past people really quick .
That little chirp followed by two chirps is now switched on .
And it works . It works .
And it accelerates the amount and level of the stimulation .
It works .
And this , this is the implantable generation .
I should clarify that .
The audience is too small .
So he saw a need and he stepped in .
He &apos;s a very , very remarkable man .
He &apos;s done a lot of very cutting-edge science .
Thank you . Thank you .
Ben Goldacre : Battling bad science
And nobody really knows what epidemiology is .
And these are just some of the examples .
So already you can see there are contradictions .
Coffee both causes and prevents cancer .
That &apos;s what happens in academic journals .
That &apos;s what happens at academic conferences .
And nobody minds that . We actively welcome it .
Again , every country has somebody like this .
She is our TV diet guru .
She , it turns out , has a non-accredited correspondence course Ph.D.
from somewhere in America .
You get a certificate and everything .
Next , we need proper science , proper evidence .
So , &quot; Red wine can help prevent breast cancer . &quot;
This is a headline from the Daily Telegraph in the U.K.
So what we want is studies in real human people .
And here &apos;s another example .
You have to take a snapshot of how people are now .
So ideally what you want to do is a trial .
And this is the trial of fish oil pills .
And they said , &quot; We &apos;ve done a trial .
That should always ring alarm bells .
Now can anybody spot a flaw in this design ?
So there &apos;s no control ; there &apos;s no control group .
But that sounds really techie .
That &apos;s a technical term .
The kids got the pills , and then their performance improved .
They got older . We all develop over time .
And of course , also there &apos;s the placebo effect .
It &apos;s about our beliefs and expectations .
It &apos;s about the cultural meaning of a treatment .
Two sugar pills a day beats one sugar pill a day .
But that &apos;s not enough .
But actually in a lot of situations that &apos;s wrong .
And this is exactly what happened which antipsychotic medication for schizophrenia .
So how does this work ?
How can we explain this strange phenomenon ?
And this is the most important aspect of the whole story .
It &apos;s at the top of the pyramid of evidence .
You can use statistics , or you can use stories .
This is something called funnel plot .
So they all cluster together .
The big trials are closer to the true answer .
Well they &apos;re heinous , they really are .
This is a drug called reboxetine .
This is a drug that I myself have prescribed to patients .
And I &apos;m a very nerdy doctor .
I found no flaw .
And this is not an isolated story .
This is a problem that is currently lacking a solution .
This is undoubtedly the single biggest ethical problem facing medicine today .
Thank you very much .
Michael Anti : Behind the Great Firewall of China
Something is very challenging to me .
I want to make my friends understand : China is complicated .
You can &apos;t just tell a one sided story .
I &apos;ll give an example . China is a BRIC country .
BRIC country means Brazil , Russia , India and China .
The four countries have no access to Facebook .
So basically , China is a SICK BRIC country .
Another project was built up to watch China and Chinese Internet .
It prevents weird things from the north .
Same was true for China .
It protected China from invaders for 2,000 years .
But China also has a great firewall .
That &apos;s the biggest digital boundary in the whole world .
So , basically the &quot; Internet &quot; has two Internets .
One is the Internet , the other is the Chinanet .
But sometimes this kind of a metaphor is too simple .
So today I want to upgrade it to 2.0 version .
In China , we have 500 million Internet users .
How to make it ? It &apos;s simple .
You have Google , we have Baidu .
You have Twitter , we have Weibo .
You have Facebook , we have Renren .
You have YouTube , we have Youku and Tudou .
That &apos;s not only to censor you .
Sometimes the Arab dictators didn &apos;t understand these two hands .
For example , Mubarak , he shut down the Internet .
He wanted to prevent the Netizens &#91; from criticizing &#93; him .
And now the result is very simple .
We all know Mubarak is technically dead .
That means keep the server in your hands .
Because we have 300 million microbloggers in China .
It &apos;s the entire population of the United States .
So it angered the Chinese Netizens .
So a suggestion , it &apos;s not good to go outside .
But that is the Ministry &apos;s data . He shows 50 .
You can almost have all the journalistic elements there .
For example , this is Hamlet , of Shakespeare .
Chinese is always cheating , right ?
It even has its own name , with Weibo .
&quot; Weibo &quot; is the Chinese translation for &quot; microblog &quot; .
It has its own innovation .
It became the media platform of 300 million readers .
It became the media .
So they send them back in recent years .
And even some of them were put into black jails .
People just use their cell phones to tweet .
They &apos;re almost like a national TV station .
It &apos;s like a big TED , right ?
Why ? Because they have the data .
They have everything in their hands .
So the crackdown is very serious .
The server is in Beijing .
It &apos;s never happened before .
So this kind of freedom is a targeted and precise window .
So Chinese in China , censorship is normal .
Something you find is , freedom is weird .
Something will happen behind it .
They just give them a target window to not censor people .
Not censoring in China has become a political tool .
So that &apos;s the update about this game , cat-and-mouse .
Social media changed Chinese mindset .
So , what &apos;s the future ?
After all , we are the mouse .
SOPA , PIPA , ACTA , TPP and ITU .
So my conclusion is very simple .
Thank you .
Paul Stamets : 6 ways mushrooms can save the world
We all know the Earth is in trouble .
I think that vote is occurring right now .
This holds up to 30,000 times its mass .
They generate the humus soils across the landmasses of Earth .
Most of you are familiar with Portobello mushrooms .
And frankly , I face a big obstacle .
Mushrooms are very fast in their growth .
Day 21 , day 23 , day 25 .
Mushrooms produce strong antibiotics .
We share in common the same pathogens .
But here is a mushroom that &apos;s past its prime .
After they sporulate , they do rot .
And so we see a mushroom here sporulating .
My foot is covering approximately 300 miles of mycelium .
This is photomicrographs from Nick Read and Patrick Hickey .
We exhale carbon dioxide , so does mycelium .
It inhales oxygen , just like we do .
But these are essentially externalized stomachs and lungs .
These are little wells .
And inside these wells , then microbial communities begin to form .
When you look at the mycelium , they &apos;re highly branched .
The mycelium is sentient .
It knows that you are there .
And this is the paradigm that we see throughout the universe .
How is that possible ?
Oxalic acid is two carbon dioxide molecules joined together .
This was first discovered in 1859 .
This is a photograph by Franz Hueber .
This photograph &apos;s taken 1950s in Saudi Arabia .
420 million years ago , this organism existed .
It was called Prototaxites .
Prototaxites , laying down , was about three feet tall .
Across the landscapes of Earth were dotted these giant mushrooms .
All across most land masses .
And these existed for tens of millions of years .
Sunlight was cut off , and fungi inherited the Earth .
The largest organism in the world is in Eastern Oregon .
We were involved with several experiments .
Battelle Laboratories and I joined up in Bellingham , Washington .
The mycelium absorbs the oil .
These are the same bonds that hold hydrocarbons together .
The enzymes remanufactured the hydrocarbons into carbohydrates -- fungal sugars .
Some of these mushrooms are very happy mushrooms .
They &apos;re very large .
They &apos;re showing how much nutrition that they could &apos;ve obtained .
The last image we don &apos;t have .
The entire pile was a green berm of life .
And I &apos;ll show you a graph here .
This is a logarithmic scale , 10 to the eighth power .
Think of the implications .
as a treatment against consumption .
May not seem that large -- let &apos;s get closer .
This is extremely rare fungus .
We found one sample to be able to get into culture .
I &apos;ve been involved with the U.S. Defense Department BioShield program .
And a few years ago , we received these results .
10 or greater are considered to be very active .
Our mushroom strains were in the highly active range .
I became interested in entomopathogenic fungi -- fungi that kill insects .
Our house was being destroyed by carpenter ants .
I did something that nobody else had done .
I actually chased the mycelium , when it stopped producing spores .
These are spores -- this is in their spores .
I was able to morph the culture into a non-sporulating form .
They gave it to the queen .
One week later , I had no sawdust piles whatsoever .
Now after sporulation , the spores repel .
So , the house is no longer suitable for invasion .
So , you have a near-permanent solution for reinvasion of termites .
This has huge implications .
It &apos;s been called an Alexander Graham Bell patent .
It covers over 200,000 species .
This could totally revamp the pesticide industries throughout the world .
The seeds then are mothered by this mycelium .
But watch what happens here .
And we came up with Econol .
These are a species that we need to join with .
I think engaging mycelium can help save the world .
Thank you very much .
Erik Hersman : Reporting crisis via texting
A year ago in Kenya we had post-election violence .
We got reports like this .
And our system was rudimentary . It was very basic .
But then we decided we needed to do something more .
There is even some from the U.S.
We are realizing that this is true .
If it works in Africa then it will work anywhere .
There is so much information ; what do you do ?
How do you decide what is important ?
What is the veracity level of what you &apos;re looking at ?
What we are looking at is the first three hours .
How do we deal with that information that is coming in ?
You can &apos;t understand what is actually happening .
But now what ?
And we have a small team who is working on this .
We think that we can actually create a crowdsourced filter .
Take the crowd and apply them to the information .
It &apos;s coming from places that you wouldn &apos;t expect .
From young , smart developers .
So , thank you very much .
Sylvia Earle : My wish : Protect our oceans
It does concern you , as well .
Well , now is that time .
Health to the ocean means health for us .
Did I say that ? I guess I did .
It was six miles offshore and 1,250 feet down .
It &apos;s one of my favorite bathing suits .
And I &apos;m living proof .
Ninety-seven percent of Earth &apos;s water is ocean .
No blue , no green .
Mars comes to mind .
No ocean , no life support system .
That &apos;s where all the assets are !
No matter where on Earth you live .
No water , no life ; no blue , no green .
And with knowing comes caring .
But first we have to know .
You did a great job with the land , the dirt .
What about the water ? &quot;
We can go explore the other side of the Hawaiian Islands .
There &apos;s nothing quite like being personally inspected by a whale .
One-way trips are easy .
We need new deep-diving submarines .
How about some X Prizes for ocean exploration ?
We can now go to the Arctic .
An ice-free Arctic Ocean may happen in this century .
That &apos;s bad news for the polar bears .
That &apos;s bad news for us too .
That &apos;s bad news for coral reefs and oxygen-producing plankton .
Also it &apos;s bad news for us .
All of these parts are part of our life support system .
The highest concentrations are in red .
But , there is good news .
Ten percent of the big fish still remain .
There are still some blue whales .
There are still some krill in Antarctica .
There are a few oysters in Chesapeake Bay .
Imagine the ocean without fish .
Imagine what that means to our life support system .
That &apos;s another great idea .
And you can find them on Google Earth .
We don &apos;t consume 200-year-old cows or chickens .
Our fate and the ocean &apos;s are one .
We need deep-diving subs , new technologies to explore the ocean .
How much ?
Some say 10 percent , some say 30 percent .
Thank you .
Sophal Ear : Escaping the Khmer Rouge
I normally teach courses on how to rebuild states after war .
And we &apos;re actually Cambodians .
And this picture is taken in Vietnam .
April 17th , 1975 .
The Khmer Rouge closes the doors to the outside world .
But after four years the grim truth seeps out .
And here is a picture of the Khmer Rouge .
They were young soldiers , typically child soldiers .
The Khmer Rouge didn &apos;t believe in money .
But not just that , they actually banned money .
My family was moved from Phnom Penh to Pursat province .
This is a picture of what Pursat looks like .
And in fact they were forced to work the fields .
And at about this time actually my father got very sick .
And he didn &apos;t speak Vietnamese .
So he died actually , in January 1976 .
And we end up in Hong Ngu on the Vietnamese side .
And then onwards to Chau Doc .
And this is a picture of Hong Ngu , Vietnam today .
A pretty idyllic place on the Mekong Delta .
But for us it meant freedom .
And freedom from persecution from the Khmer Rouge .
I &apos;m happy , actually , today , to present her .
She &apos;s here today with us in the audience .
Thank you mother .
Paul Bloom : The origins of pleasure
This is Hermann Goering .
And like Hitler , Goering fancied himself a collector of art .
And what he really wanted was something by Vermeer .
And it was his favorite artwork ever .
Six weeks into his prison sentence , van Meegeren confessed .
But he didn &apos;t confess to treason .
I painted it myself ; I &apos;m a forger . &quot;
Now nobody believed him .
And he said , &quot; I &apos;ll prove it .
So they brought him in .
He painted a beautiful Vermeer .
And then the charges of treason were dropped .
Now Goering was , by all accounts , a terrible man .
Even for a Nazi , he was a terrible man .
His American interrogators described him as an amicable psychopath .
And he killed himself soon afterwards .
It wasn &apos;t just him who was in for a shock .
It was not that painting , but that painting .
Why does this matter ?
I &apos;m a psychologists -- why do origins matter so much ?
Well there &apos;s an answer that many people would give .
So take food .
Would you eat this ?
That &apos;s not so surprising .
So one demonstration of this was done with young children .
How do you get adults to really enjoy wine ?
It &apos;s very simple : pour it from an expensive bottle .
This was recently done with a neuroscientific twist .
Everybody , of course , drinks exactly the same wine .
Or take sex .
These are stimuli I &apos;ve used in some of my studies .
Knowing somebody &apos;s your kin typically kills the libido .
If you like somebody , they look better to you .
Now often , a result of Capgras syndrome is tragic .
This was recorded in 1931 .
As a third example , consider consumer products .
So one reason why you might like something is its utility .
The shoes are perhaps the most valuable of all .
So one answer was George Clooney .
That causes a huge drop in the value .
So let &apos;s go back to art .
In the case of artwork , the history is special indeed .
They may look alike , but they have a different history .
This is a work by Jackson Pollock .
Who here likes the work of Jackson Pollock ?
Okay . Who here , it does nothing for them ?
They just don &apos;t like it .
And they then reported that her father was coaching her .
This is Joshua Bell , a very famous violinist .
And here &apos;s a brief clip of this .
he made 32 dollars .
Not bad . It &apos;s also not good .
So she &apos;s struck with pity .
She reaches into her purse and hands him a 20 .
And people have different views on this .
One lovely experiment was done by Kurt Gray and Dan Wegner .
And they gave them a series of painful electric shocks .
So it was a series of five painful shocks .
There &apos;s no malevolence , they &apos;re just pressing a button .
The first shock is recorded as very painful .
The third drops , the fourth , the fifth .
The pain gets less .
The first shock hurts like hell .
And I &apos;ll end with that . Thank you .
Eric Whitacre : A virtual choir 2,000 voices strong
I wanted to be a rock star .
This was in the late &apos; 80s .
They wouldn &apos;t have me .
And I was certain that &apos;s what my life would be .
And the soprano section is just full of hot girls . &quot;
Britlin Losee : Hi Mr. Eric Whitacre .
Here &apos;s me singing &quot; Sleep . &quot;
I &apos;m a little nervous , just to let you know .
Such an intimate video .
So I wrote on my blog , &quot; OMG OMG . &quot;
And I sent out this call to singers .
And lo and behold , people started uploading their videos .
And then as the videos started to come in ...
This is Cheryl Ang from Singapore .
This is Evangelina Etienne from Massachusetts .
Stephen Hanson from Sweden .
This is Jamal Walker from Dallas , Texas .
And a number of sopranos uploaded their parts .
Here &apos;s our winner of the soprano solo .
This is Melody Myers from Tennessee .
And from the crowd emerged this young man , Scott Haines .
And Scott aggregated all of the videos .
He scrubbed the audio .
He made sure that everything lined up .
This is &quot; Lux Aurumque &quot; sung by the Virtual Choir .
I &apos;ll stop it there in the interest of time .
Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you .
So there &apos;s more . There &apos;s more .
Thank you so much .
And I had the same reaction you did .
I actually was moved to tears when I first saw it .
And the video went viral .
This time we got some more mature members .
And some younger members .
Isn &apos;t that the sweetest thing you &apos;ve ever seen ?
This is Beau Awtin .
And there were 900 people involved in that .
So I told the singers , &quot; That &apos;s our goal .
That &apos;s the number for us to beat . &quot;
Thank you .
And I &apos;ve just chosen a few of them here .
Now she &apos;s an airman in the air force constantly traveling .
It &apos;s so wonderful to sing together again ! &quot;
I love the idea that she &apos;s singing with her sister .
Me too .
So two things struck me deeply about this .
It doesn &apos;t matter the technology .
It wasn &apos;t a virtual choir .
This will be a premiere today .
We &apos;re not finished with the video yet .
But we do have the first three minutes .
You &apos;re the very first people to see this .
This is &quot; Sleep , &quot; the Virtual Choir .
Thank you very much . Thank you . Thank you .
Karen Thompson Walker : What fear can teach us
No search party was coming to look for these men .
In English , fear is something we conquer .
It &apos;s something we fight . It &apos;s something we overcome .
But what if we looked at fear in a fresh way ?
Twenty-four hours had now passed since the capsizing of the ship .
But they &apos;d heard some frightening rumors .
And fears and storytelling have the same components .
They have the same architecture .
Like all stories , fears have characters .
In our fears , the characters are us .
Fears also have suspense .
Our fears provoke in us a very similar form of suspense .
What would happen to our minds ?
Once in a while , our fears can predict the future .
After much deliberation , the men finally made a decision .
They dreamed up a variety of horrifying scenarios .
The problem was that they listened to the wrong story .
Thank you .
Gregory Petsko : The coming neurological epidemic
A cheery thought .
This is the world we live in .
And this is the world your children will live in .
It &apos;s already flattening out .
This is why it &apos;s happening .
It will be well over a trillion dollars by 2050 .
And the Avian Flu is also not a good idea .
But hey , you &apos;re listening to me .
So you &apos;ve got that covered .
Because the clock is ticking for all of us .
Thank you .
Arthur Potts Dawson : A vision for sustainable restaurants
That &apos;s a lot .
I want to take something rather humble to discuss .
It grows and is nurtured .
It &apos;s then harvested .
It &apos;s then distributed , and distribution is a massive issue .
There are different types of waste .
Okay , so you ask what a sustainable restaurant looks like .
Basically a restaurant just like any other .
This is the restaurant , Acorn House .
Front and back .
So let me run you through a few ideas .
Floor : sustainable , recyclable .
Chairs : recycled and recyclable .
Tables : Forestry Commission .
This is Norwegian Forestry Commission wood .
I hate waste , especially walls .
The whole business is run on sustainable energy .
And that &apos;s a plastic polymer .
Will they outlive me ? They probably might .
Right , here &apos;s a reconditioned coffee machine .
Now reusing is vital .
And we filter our own water .
Here &apos;s a great little example .
This is the kitchen , which is in the same room .
It serves 220 people a day .
We generate quite a lot of waste .
This is the waste room .
You can &apos;t get rid of waste .
In here , I have produce and boxes that are unavoidable .
I compost it in this garden .
A couple of wormeries in there too .
It was like vegetable jerky , and killed all of them .
What you &apos;re seeing here is a water filtration system .
So , water is a very important aspect .
I started meditating on that and created a restaurant called Waterhouse .
I managed to do it .
They &apos;re all English and a little bit more sustainable .
But this is an electrical restaurant .
The whole thing is electric , the restaurant and the kitchen .
It literally is Waterhouse .
This is basically air-handling .
Very advanced , no air-conditioning -- I love it .
There &apos;s no accident in names of these restaurants .
I &apos;ve got metal and earth to come .
So you &apos;ve got to watch your space for that .
Okay . So this is my next project .
The People &apos;s Supermarket .
This is a social enterprise , not-for-profit cooperative supermarket .
Really important .
I mean , the whole thing is is super-sustainable .
That &apos;s zero food waste .
And no one &apos;s doing that just yet .
I &apos;m going to get there before you .
Environmentally conscious businesses are doable .
The idea is embryonic .
I think it &apos;s important .
So these three are not perfect -- they &apos;re ideas .
And I hope you all take part .
Thank you very much .
Aaron Huey : America &apos;s native prisoners of war
I &apos;m here today to show my photographs of the Lakota .
It means greedy .
So take a look around this auditorium today .
I &apos;ll begin in 1824 .
According to the treaty , those lands are a sovereign nation .
The treaties were out the window .
I want to repeat that part .
The Lakota defeat the U.S. army .
1869 : The transcontinental railroad was completed .
Also in 1871 , we ended the time of treaty-making .
We had plans .
He was later killed while in custody .
Only 10 percent of the adult male population signed .
That clause was obviously ignored .
1887 : The Dawes Act .
Communal ownership of reservation lands ends .
Tribes lost millions of acres .
Once again , the fat of the land goes to wasichu .
This is the year of the Wounded Knee Massacre .
Everything can be measured before Wounded Knee and after .
They were tired of treaties .
They were tired of sacred hills .
They were tired of ghost dances .
And they were tired of all the inconveniences of the Sioux .
So they brought out their cannons .
Fast-forward .
39 percent of homes on Pine Ridge have no electricity .
Cervical cancer is five times higher than the U.S. national average .
School dropout rate is up to 70 percent .
Teacher turnover is eight times higher than the U.S. national average .
They &apos;re killing each other .
They &apos;re killing themselves while we watch them die . &quot;
This is how we came to own these United States .
This is the legacy of manifest destiny .
Is any of this your responsibility today ?
There must be some call to action .
So where does that leave us ?
Shrugging our shoulders in the dark ?
Give back the Black Hills .
It &apos;s not your business what they do with them .
Jackie Tabick : The balancing act of compassion
One of my favorite cartoon characters is Snoopy .
We all , I think , believe in compassion .
And all the main religions have similar teachings .
And there are some charity workers who call this compassion fatigue .
Because , after all , God is just .
Therefore , there should be justice throughout the world .
There had to be limits to all things .
If you put boiling water in , it will shatter .
And so God put both of these possibilities into the world .
There is something more though that has to be there .
We actually have to do something about it .
What does this compassion entail ?
It entails understanding the pain of the other .
I call that unity God .
And that unity is something that connects all of creation .
This &quot; 18 minutes &quot; business , I find quite fascinating .
And they say &quot; It &apos;s 18 minutes . &quot;
What does it mean , &quot; dough becomes leaven &quot; ?
It means it gets filled with hot air .
Then he went home .
The cleaner came into the synagogue .
Ah , what a wonderful smell . &quot;
He goes to the ark . He opens the ark .
Takes the bread and goes home .
He goes in there , and it &apos;s not there .
Next week , with raisins . &quot;
This went on for years .
Take the bread . Take it home .
The rabbi came in and saw what was going on .
And he called the two of them to his office .
And the rich man -- oh , dear -- crestfallen .
&quot; You mean God didn &apos;t want my bread ? &quot;
And the rabbi said , &quot; You &apos;ve misunderstood me .
You &apos;ve misunderstood totally , &quot; he said .
And so try to bring compassion to life in this world .
Henry Evans and Chad Jenkins : Meet the robots for humanity
Henry Evans : Hello .
I grew up in a typical American town near St. Louis .
My dad was a lawyer .
My mom was a homemaker .
Later on , I earned an MBA at Stanford .
I married my high school sweetheart , Jane .
I am lucky to have her .
Together , we raised four wonderful children .
I became fascinated with using technology to help the severely disabled .
I shaved myself for the first time in 10 years .
From my home in California , I shaved Charlie in Atlanta .
I handed out Halloween candy .
I opened my refrigerator on my own .
I began doing tasks around the house .
All of us have disabilities in one form or another .
By the way , check out my sweet ride .
I inspected the solar panels on our roof .
I just wish I could afford the tuition .
Okay , Henry , have you been to D.C. lately ?
Are you excited to be at TEDxMidAtlantic ?
Can you show us how excited you are ?
All right , big finish .
Can you show us how good of a pilot you are ?
Back to you , Henry .
HE : Thank you , Chad .
Actually , that &apos;s not true .
I would have died .
Thank you .
Alexa Meade : Your body is my canvas
You may want to take a closer look .
There &apos;s more to this painting than meets the eye .
I painted it directly on top of the man .
There &apos;s no Photoshop here .
This is just a photo of one of my three-dimensional paintings .
It was about shadows .
I came up with the idea of painting shadows .
But I didn &apos;t just want to paint the shadows .
But something kept on flickering before my eyes .
I wasn &apos;t quite sure what I was looking at .
I had turned my friend into a painting .
I had no idea where to begin .
It was about space and light .
It just would erase my brush strokes like invisible ink .
I was having so much fun with this process .
We got a pool . We filled it with milk .
We filled it with Sheila . And I began painting .
All right , well , hide your face .
Thank you .
Peter van Uhm : Why I chose a gun
Some chose the microscope as their instrument .
Some chose the pen .
Others work through the instrument of money .
Ladies and gentlemen , I made a different choice .
Thanks .
Ladies and gentlemen -- I share your goals .
I share the goals of the speakers you heard before .
I chose this instrument .
I chose the gun .
It may even feel scary .
A real gun at a few feet &apos;s distance .
Let us stop for a moment and feel this uneasiness .
You could even hear it .
It means The Netherlands is a peaceful country .
The Netherlands is not at war .
It means soldiers are not needed to patrol our streets .
Guns are not a part of our lives .
In many countries it is a different story .
In many countries people are confronted with guns .
They are oppressed .
Weapons can do a lot of harm .
They are the cause of much distress .
Why then am I standing before you with this weapon ?
Why did I choose the gun as my instrument ?
Today I want to tell you why .
And I want to tell you how this gun can help .
The Nazis invaded The Netherlands .
Their grim plans were evident .
They meant to rule by means of repression .
Diplomacy had failed to stop the Germans .
Only brute force remained .
It was our last resort .
My father was there to provide it .
When he aimed , he never missed .
He fired . Nothing happened .
He fired again .
No German soldier fell to the ground .
He could have done something .
So this story stayed with me .
They liberated my birth town .
I do not like guns .
Violence has declined dramatically over the last 500 years .
Statistics show that we are living in a relatively peaceful era .
Why ?
Why has violence decreased ?
Has the human mind changed ?
Well we were talking on the human mind this morning .
Or is there something else ?
Abstaining from violence becomes more profitable than starting a war .
Now nonviolence starts to work like a flywheel .
It enhances peace even further .
Where there is no conflict , trade flourishes .
And trade is another important incentive against violence .
The armed forces implement the state monopoly on violence .
My soldiers use the gun as an instrument of peace .
And this is exactly why failed states are so dangerous .
Failed states have no legitimized , democratically controlled use of force .
It takes hard work , often behind the scenes .
It takes good equipment and well-trained , dedicated soldiers .
Because she wants a better world .
Thank you very much .
Niall Ferguson : The 6 killer apps of prosperity
Let &apos;s talk about billions .
Let &apos;s talk about past and future billions .
We know that about 106 billion people have ever lived .
And we know that most of them are dead .
Let &apos;s talk about billions .
Economic historians call this &quot; The Great Divergence . &quot;
And the blue line is the ratio of American to Chinese .
And this chart goes back to 1500 .
They start off pretty close together .
And that &apos;s allowing for differences in the cost of living .
It &apos;s based on purchasing power parity .
So why ?
This wasn &apos;t just an economic story .
Everybody did empire .
They beat preexisting Oriental empires like the Mughals and the Ottomans .
This is not a new question .
That &apos;s a great question .
It &apos;s not geography .
It &apos;s the ideas .
It &apos;s the institutions .
This must be true because a Scotsman said it .
You bet .
That is so right and so cool .
And he said it such a long time ago .
Let &apos;s call them the killer apps .
They &apos;re just icons ; you click on them .
But behind the icon , there &apos;s complex code .
It &apos;s the same with institutions .
There are six which I think explain the Great Divergence .
One , competition .
Two , the scientific revolution .
Three , property rights .
Four , modern medicine .
Five , the consumer society .
And six , the work ethic .
Once you do that , your artillery becomes accurate .
Think of what that means .
That really was a killer application .
Meanwhile , there &apos;s no scientific revolution anywhere else .
You just have to feed me . &quot;
Most people in rural North America owned some land by 1900 .
Hardly anyone in South America did .
That &apos;s another killer app .
It even did that in the European empires .
It doesn &apos;t rise any faster after these countries become independent .
The empires weren &apos;t all bad .
You need people to want to wear tons of clothes .
Japan was the first non-Western society to embrace it .
Finally , the work ethic .
Max Weber thought that was peculiarly Protestant .
He was wrong .
In fact , the West has lost its work ethic .
Who &apos;s got the work ethic now ?
Take a look at mathematical attainment by 15 year-olds .
and Albania and Tunisia .
You &apos;re wrong .
Why ?
Because the killer apps can be downloaded .
It &apos;s open source .
Because it &apos;s on your watch that this is happening .
And could Africa get that sequencing wrong ?
Warning : that may not work .
And third , can China do without killer app number three ?
That &apos;s the basis for the Western model of representative government .
But I don &apos;t think his studio has been rebuilt .
That &apos;s so true .
That &apos;s not the way history works .
The West may collapse very suddenly .
Thanks very much .
What &apos;s your view on that ?
He was an expert in Latin American history .
That tells you something really important .
Mostly they &apos;re worried about each other .
And that &apos;s all we seem to be caring about recently .
I think that &apos;s its real importance .
Niall , thank you .
Louise Fresco : We need to feed the whole world
I &apos;m not at all a cook .
Bread is not only standard in the Western diet .
So I &apos;m going to bake bread for you .
First of all , a little bit of audience participation .
I have two loaves of bread here .
I didn &apos;t know this word until I arrived .
Who prefers the whole-meal bread ?
I have two tentative male hands .
It &apos;s about a traditional way of living .
A way that is perhaps more real , more honest .
And life is really , too .
And this is about good taste , good traditions .
Why do we have this image ?
Why do we feel that this is more true than this ?
Art has helped us to maintain that kind of image .
It was a mythical past .
Of course , the reality is quite different .
It brought us power . It brought us mechanization , fertilizers .
And it actually drove up our yields .
That is the reality of our modern life .
Now you may prefer this loaf of bread .
Excuse my hands but this is how it is .
But it has changed the world .
So what is happening ?
And the world population in the meantime has doubled .
What happened to our bread in the meantime ?
That is , historically , a really unique situation .
So as food became more plentiful , bread became cheaper .
We added in more sugar .
But this is now this strange concoction of high calories .
And this is where I have to query all of you .
It was invented by farmers in Iraq and Syria in particular .
The counter-movement says , &quot; Let &apos;s go back to this .
Let &apos;s go back to traditional farming .
Don &apos;t we all agree ? I certainly agree .
But this is a fallacy .
So local food production is out .
So we must find other solutions .
The main driver of that is actually meat .
That need for animal protein is going to continue .
So what can we do ?
Can we find a solution to produce more ?
Yes . But we need mechanization .
And I &apos;m making a real plea here .
You cannot ask people to work under these conditions .
So what can we do ?
We must feed three billion people in cities .
But yes there are some solutions .
We &apos;ve moved towards large-scale and very high control .
That &apos;s where we should move .
So we need to think differently about agriculture science .
That is not necessary .
So what kind of science can we have ?
Use biotechnology where useful , particularly in pest and disease resistance .
We have much cleverer irrigation .
We need to think that land is multi-functional .
It has different functions .
And we also need to re-examine livestock .
Go regional and go to urban food systems .
I want to see fish ponds in parking lots and basements .
There are all kinds of ways we can do it .
We cannot solve the world food problem by using biological agriculture .
But we can do a lot more .
Everything is linked together .
There is all kinds of things we can do .
You must go back and think about your own food chain .
Talk to people in restaurants .
Understand that you are part of this enormous chain of events .
And that frees you up to do other things .
And above all , to me , food is about respect .
We need to help to lift them out of poverty .
It &apos;s not about nutrients and calories .
Let me share some of the food with you .
Take some of my bread .
Have some of it .
Every meal you eat contains ingredients from all across the world .
And that , I think , evolutionarily-speaking is unique .
We &apos;ve never had that before .
So enjoy your bread .
Eat it , and feel privileged .
Thank you very much .
John Legend : &quot; True Colors &quot;
Cameron Herold : Let &apos;s raise kids to be entrepreneurs
Our MBA programs do not teach kids to be entrepreneurs .
They teach them to go work in corporations .
I look at even my family .
Both my grandfathers were entrepreneurs . My dad was an entrepreneur .
But kids could be entrepreneurs as well .
So this thing right here is freaking me out .
Attention deficit disorder , bipolar disorder .
Do you know that bipolar disorder is nicknamed the CEO disease ?
Ted Turner &apos;s got it . Steve Jobs has it .
All three of the founders of Netscape had it .
I could go on and on .
Kids -- you can see these signs in kids .
Sorry , entrepreneurs aren &apos;t students .
We fast-track . We figure out the game .
I stole essays . I cheated on exams .
So I just figured that out earlier .
In managerial accounting , I &apos;m chapter eight .
I open up chapter eight talking about budgeting .
But kids , you can see these signs in them .
It doesn &apos;t mean you have to get through school .
Is it thing one or thing two ? What is it ?
I was groomed as an entrepreneur .
And so I &apos;ll just go get them .
And I learned that you could actually negotiate with people .
I sold license plate protectors door to door .
I sold newspapers .
And he wouldn &apos;t buy a newspaper from me ever .
And he said , &quot; I know . &quot;
I learned that at a young age .
I did comic book arbitrage .
You &apos;ve got this demand over here that has money .
So that &apos;s obvious , right .
There &apos;s still 13 trillion dollars circulating in the U.S. economy .
So I would collect the tips and get payment .
So I would go and collect for all the papers .
He could just deliver them .
Because then I realized I could make the money .
My dad owned an automotive and industrial repair shop .
He had all these old automotive parts lying around .
They had this old brass and copper .
I saw there was money in garbage .
And I thought that was kind of cool .
Strangely enough , 30 years later , we &apos;re building 1-800-GOT-JUNK ?
and making money off that too .
And you &apos;d make these chairs .
And I had these little pillows that I would sew up .
And you could stuff pins in them .
Because people used to sew and they needed a pin cushion .
But what I realized was that you had to have options .
So I actually spray painted a whole bunch of them brown .
It was , &quot; Which color would you like ? &quot;
So I learned that lesson at a young age .
I learned that manual labor really sucks .
Right , like cutting lawns is brutal .
Because you can &apos;t sell them more .
And people could never get their bags up it .
And they &apos;d give me their orders for the following week .
I went and got golf balls from golf courses .
You just pick them up with both feet .
You can &apos;t do it on stage .
I packaged them up three ways .
Those sold for two dollars each .
And they could use those for practice balls .
But it paid the bills .
So I sold lots and lots of sunglasses .
That was cool because then I had retail outlets .
And I think I was 14 .
Supply , demand , big opportunity .
It had our university logo on it .
Why don &apos;t you teach them not to waste money ?
And I remember that lesson to this day .
Allowances teach kids the wrong habits .
An entrepreneur doesn &apos;t expect a regular paycheck .
Come to me and tell me what it is .
And then you know what we do ? We negotiate .
They go around looking for what it is .
Both my nine- and seven-year-olds have a stock broker already .
But I &apos;m teaching them to force that savings habit .
Shit , you &apos;ve missed 25 years .
Don &apos;t read them bedtime stories every night .
My kids do that all the time .
Just do that kind of stuff and have fun with it .
Those are entrepreneurial traits that you want to be nurturing .
Show the kids what bad customers or bad employees look like .
Show them the grumpy employees .
And say , &quot; These ones are good ones . &quot;
My kids love this stuff .
Look for that kind of stuff .
Bipolar disorder is nicknamed the CEO disease .
We wouldn &apos;t have have that stuff , right ?
Al Gore really would have had to invented the Internet .
Because there &apos;s huge opportunities in that .
I want to close with a quick little video .
These guys , Grasshopper .
It &apos;s about kids . It &apos;s about entrepreneurship .
Rodrigo Canales : The deadly genius of drug cartels
And so his team stepped aside .
This is happening just south of the border .
They were part of the bad guys .
Hence the violence .
Think about this for a second .
And so we &apos;re actually here to protect you .
Finally , the Sinaloa Federation .
They have designed new drug products and new drug processes .
They have professional videographers on staff .
Thank you .
Dan Ariely : Are we in control of our own decisions ?
I &apos;ll tell you a little bit about irrational behavior .
Not yours , of course -- other people &apos;s .
So I decided to try and write something more fun .
And I wrote a couple of chapters .
Something a bit more free , less constrained . &quot;
So I wrote a book on my research .
And it turned out to be quite fun in two ways .
First of all , I enjoyed writing .
Which I think is just fascinating .
I will tell you a little bit about irrational behavior .
So think about these two tables .
And you must have seen this illusion .
Which one seems longer ?
Can anybody see anything but the left one being longer ?
No , right ? It &apos;s impossible .
I can animate the lines .
Brown . Thank you .
The bottom one ? Yellow .
Turns out they &apos;re identical .
Can anybody see them as identical ?
Very very hard .
I can cover the rest of the cube up .
There is no way for us not to see this illusion .
I want you to think about illusion as a metaphor .
Vision is one of the best things we do .
And we are evolutionarily designed to do vision .
And this is one of my favorite plots in social sciences .
It &apos;s from a paper by Johnson and Goldstein .
Right ? How much do you care about people ?
Or maybe it is about religion .
By the way , the Netherlands is an interesting story .
It &apos;s 28 percent in organ donation .
So what are they doing ?
And here is the story .
And what happens ?
People don &apos;t check , and they don &apos;t join .
Now think about what this means .
They are residing in the person who is designing that form .
Very , very hard to think that you will influence us .
It &apos;s the opposite . It &apos;s because we care .
It &apos;s difficult and it &apos;s complex .
I &apos;ll give you one more example for this .
This is from a paper by Redelmeier and Schaefer .
And they basically took a group of physicians .
And they presented to them a case study of a patient .
Here is a patient . He is a 67-year-old farmer .
All these medications , nothing seems to be working .
So you refer the patient to hip replacement therapy .
Hip replacement . Okay ? &quot;
You did not try ibuprofen .
Or do you let them go and have hip replacement ? &quot;
Very good for the physicians .
You let them go . Or you pull them back .
There is one more decision .
What happens now ?
Let &apos;s go for hip replacement . &quot;
Imagine I give you a choice .
Do you want to go for a weekend to Rome ?
Or a weekend in Paris ?
Rome with coffee becomes more popular . And people choose it .
Here are two examples of this principle .
An online subscription for 59 dollars .
A print subscription for 125 .
Or you could get both for 125 .
Now I looked at this and I called up The Economist .
And I tried to figure out what were they thinking .
I took this and I gave it to 100 MIT students .
I said , &quot; What would you choose ? &quot;
Thankfully nobody wanted the dominated option .
That means our students can read .
Now the most popular option became the least popular .
And as a consequence , people chose it .
One more example of this .
Which is why we have these four-minute dates .
So I decided to do this experiment with people .
The experiment was with people .
I took Photoshop and I made Jerry slightly less attractive .
The other people , I added an ugly version of Tom .
The answer was absolutely yes .
When ugly Jerry was around , Jerry was popular .
When ugly Tom was around , Tom was popular .
Similar . Similar ... but slightly uglier .
Now you &apos;re getting it .
What is the general point ?
We have this view of ourselves , of others .
The behavioral economics perspective is slightly less generous to people .
In fact in medical terms , that &apos;s our view .
But there is a silver lining .
Are we Superman ? Or are we Homer Simpson ?
We understand our limitations , and we build around it .
Thank you very much .
Iain Hutchison : Saving faces : A facial surgeon &apos;s craft
Let &apos;s not forget it &apos;s a functional entity .
And then we have the sensual factor of the face .
Where do we like to kiss people ?
On the lips . Nibble the ears maybe .
It &apos;s the face where we &apos;re attracted to with that .
But let &apos;s not forget the hair .
Look how odd he looks with the eyebrows missing .
There &apos;s a definite difference .
They don &apos;t need this . They need psychiatric help .
Max has kindly donated his photograph to me .
In other words , he looks entirely normal .
Age is another thing when our attitude toward our appearance changes .
As you can see , it &apos;s blocking her vision .
But other adults say incredibly painful things .
And that obviously alerts the child to their unusual nature .
After surgery , everything normalizes .
We &apos;re trying to struggle to find our identity .
We crave the approval of our peers .
It &apos;s a crippling time .
That &apos;s exactly what people used to say to Sue .
She wasn &apos;t miserable at all .
People were making misjudgments all the time on her mood .
So she chose to have facial surgery .
And that &apos;s the change that can be achieved for teenagers .
He looks pretty good at this stage .
I learned a huge amount from Henry .
Henry taught me that you can carry on working .
He worked as an advocate . He continued to play cricket .
He maintained a calm insouciance .
This was something more than that . He ignored it .
And that &apos;s what these people can do .
Henriapi illustrates this phenomenon as well .
It was my longest operation .
It took 23 hours . I did it with my neurosurgeon .
He continued to work as a psychiatric nurse .
He got married . He had a son called Jeremiah .
So we &apos;ve seen that we can change people &apos;s faces .
For instance , there are two different types of facial surgery .
We can categorize it like that .
They don &apos;t feel different .
If you do cosmetic surgery , patients are often less happy .
They &apos;re trying to achieve difference in their lives .
Sue wasn &apos;t trying to achieve difference in her life .
They &apos;re people who have their face shot off .
They have it forced upon them .
Their identity doesn &apos;t change .
Muzetta &apos;s family give the lie to this .
So it &apos;s not simply a Western phenomenon .
We make judgments on people &apos;s faces all the time .
Good-looking people are always judged as being more friendly .
We look at O.J. -- he &apos;s a good-looking guy .
We think we can judge people on their expressions .
And so they want to see live witnesses .
Are we uncomfortable with this image ? Yes , we are .
We &apos;d be pretty uncomfortable .
So we &apos;ve talked a lot about facial appearance .
But that &apos;s not good enough .
This is the bar that he set for us .
So with modern technology , we used computers to make models .
We made a model of the jaw without bone in it .
We then bent a plate up to it .
We then put bone and tissue from the back .
So the patient &apos;s life is restored .
That &apos;s the good news .
It &apos;s skin from his back .
What does that mean ?
So there are going to be problems with face transplantation .
Just imagine , I can make a biologically-degradable template .
This is a bit like a Julia Child recipe .
But we &apos;ve still got problems .
We &apos;ve got mouth cancer to solve .
We &apos;re still not reconstructing them well enough .
We still can &apos;t get rid of scars .
We need to do research .
Let &apos;s leave it as it is . &quot;
Thank you very much indeed .
Tim Berners-Lee : The year open data went worldwide
The cry of &quot; Raw data now ! &quot;
So , let &apos;s roll the video .
Look at Zanesville , Ohio .
Let &apos;s look at some data from the U.K. now .
It allows anybody to go there and burrow down .
Yes , certainly you can do it over here .
How can you use this stuff ?
The red circles are polling stations , selected by your criteria .
So , that was government data .
I was not the only person editing the open street map .
Let &apos;s now spin the world during the same year .
You can see Europe is ablaze with updates .
Some places , perhaps not as much as they should be .
Here focusing in on Haiti .
We &apos;re focusing now on Port-au-Prince .
Frank Gehry : A master architect asks , Now what ?
Frank Gehry : I listened to this scientist this morning .
The wall was covered with ...
I had an explosion .
Richard Saul Wurman : Really ?
I &apos;d like to start this session again .
And I know the road was extremely difficult .
But that &apos;s an interesting thing for a creative person .
It &apos;s a big issue .
FG : Well , I &apos;ve always just ...
I &apos;ve never really gone out looking for work .
But I couldn &apos;t do anything else .
That was my response to the people in the time .
I think it was circumstantial .
And a few people got excited about it .
He &apos;s building this huge concrete place .
So where do we go now ?
Back to -- everything &apos;s so temporary .
I don &apos;t see it the way you characterized it .
For me , every day is a new thing .
I discard it .
So I approach it with the same trepidation .
RSW : What &apos;s the status of the New York project ?
FG : I don &apos;t really know .
He gets up there and then he ... comes back up .
They &apos;re still talking about it .
RSW : The picture on the screen , is that Disney ?
FG : Yeah .
He &apos;s been a cheerleader for quite a long time .
Nothing that you would call architecture , right ?
I knew Craig and respected him .
RSW : Why did you want that ?
FG : I knew you &apos;d ask that question .
It was intuitive .
I just stopped .
Did you see that thing ?
RSW : No . What did he say ?
FG : He calls architecture &quot; plumbing . &quot;
FG : Anyway , the Siza thing .
It &apos;s a richer experience .
Audience : Liquid architecture .
FG : Liquid architecture .
RSW : Is it going to be near the current campus ?
FG : No , it &apos;s near the current campus .
Anyway , he &apos;s that kind of patron .
It &apos;s not his money , of course .
RSW : What &apos;s his schedule on that ?
FG : I don &apos;t know .
What &apos;s the schedule , Richard ?
Richard Koshalek : &#91; Unclear &#93; starts from 2004 .
FG : 2004 .
You can come to the opening . I &apos;ll invite you .
RSW : I found the most remarkable thing .
I &apos;d seen drawings you had presented here at TED .
The surprise of Bilbao was in its context to the city .
That was the real surprise of Bilbao .
Blah , blah , blah and all that stuff .
And it &apos;s like cleansing yourself so that you can ...
You &apos;re not going to defy gravity .
You &apos;ve got to work with the building department .
If it leaks -- Bilbao did not leak .
I was so proud .
I met them in Bilbao .
They came for three days .
RSW : This is the computer building ?
FG : Yeah , the computer building .
People put buckets out ...
RSW : Frank had a sort of ...
FG : Ask Miriam !
And he said , &quot; Madam , move your chair . &quot;
And I told her the Frank Lloyd Wright story .
RSW : Didn &apos;t get a laugh .
FG : No . Not now either .
and then what ?
What do you bring to it ?
That &apos;s what reminded me of it .
FG : I did a teapot and nobody bought it .
RSW : Did it leak ?
FG : No .
RSW : ... people wanted a Michael Graves building .
Is that a curse , that people want a Bilbao building ?
FG : Yeah .
And I &apos;ve met with some of these people .
I asked them what kind of building it was .
So four of us went .
Each one was more beautiful than the other .
RSW : Oh , my God .
FG : So , I got up .
We stood up , we walked out .
I said , &quot; Nope . &quot;
&quot; You &apos;re not going to have dinner at all ? &quot;
And we get a lot of that .
I don &apos;t have my own plane yet .
But let me just say a couple words .
FG : Can I say something ?
Are you going to talk about me or you ?
RSW : Once a shit , always a shit !
I &apos;m going to make it for you !
FG : No , no . Wait a minute !
Bill Gates : How state budgets are breaking US schools
Well , this is about state budgets .
This is probably the most boring topic of the whole morning .
The understanding is very low .
But we have a problem .
Here &apos;s the overall picture .
U.S. economy is big -- 14.7 trillion .
Now out of that pie , the government spends 36 percent .
But we &apos;re spending 36 percent .
Well what are we taking in ?
Simple business question .
Answer is 26 percent .
In fact , this is the forecast picture .
This is what you see at this overall level .
Now how did we get here ?
How could you have a problem like this ?
But what this means actually is that there &apos;s a pretense .
So you get a big squeeze .
What were those things that allowed us to hide this ?
Well , some really nice little tricks .
And these were somewhat noticed .
The paper said , &quot; It &apos;s not really balanced .
It &apos;s got holes .
It perpetuates deficit spending .
It &apos;s riddled with gimmicks . &quot;
This is so blatant , so extreme .
They borrow money .
They sell off the assets .
They defer the payments .
They sell off the revenues from tobacco .
And California &apos;s not unique .
So it &apos;s systemic across the entire country .
This is the retiree health care benefits .
The forecast for the medical piece alone to 42 percent .
Well what &apos;s going to give ?
It really is this young versus the old to some degree .
So far it &apos;s meant layoffs , increased class sizes .
In fact , no , education spending should not be cut .
Technology has a role to play .
That &apos;s something I think is very , very important .
So what &apos;s going on ?
Where &apos;s the brain trust that &apos;s in error here ?
Well there really is no brain trust .
Just look at this spending .
Everybody has an opinion .
There &apos;s great feedback .
And the numbers are used to make decisions .
So what do we need to do ?
We need better tools .
We can get some things out on the Internet .
We need lots more .
We need better accounting .
It should be more like private accounting .
It &apos;s the gold standard .
And finally , we need to really reward politicians .
We just shot you . &quot;
But in fact , their work was sort of pushed off .
So we need these pieces .
Now I think this is a solvable problem .
It &apos;s a great country with lots of people .
Thank you .
Jonathan Drori : Every pollen grain has a story
Thank you . I have two missions here today .
Pollen is a flower &apos;s way of making more flowers .
It carries male sex cells from one flower to another .
And it &apos;s really rather better not to mate with yourself .
That &apos;s probably true of humans as well , mostly .
Pollen is produced by the anthers of flowers .
And remember that all our cereal crops are grasses as well .
Here is a scanning electron micrograph of a grain of pollen .
But not all pollen is quite so simple looking .
But anyway , take a look at its pollen .
This is amazing , I think .
Like I said , pollen carries the male sex cells .
Again -- this time , sycamore -- wind-dispersed .
Cool pollen , though .
This one I particularly like .
Remember , that thing is just about 30 micrometers across .
The pollen has little barbs on it , if we look .
Isn &apos;t that cool ?
You can tell that from the little barbs on there .
And this is where it gets interesting for forensics .
Where has it been ?
But pollen forensics can be very subtle .
This is a horse chestnut .
Russell Foster : Why do we sleep ?
We throw it away .
We really just don &apos;t think about sleep .
&quot; Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber . &quot;
Any ideas who said that ?
Shakespeare &apos;s Julius Caesar .
Yes , let me give you a few more quotes .
Extremely prophetic , by Thomas Dekker , another Elizabethan dramatist .
What do we do in the 20th century about sleep ?
We &apos;ve treated it as an enemy .
And our ignorance about sleep is really quite profound .
You don &apos;t eat . You don &apos;t drink .
And you don &apos;t have sex .
Well , most of us anyway .
So let &apos;s move to the brain .
Now , here we have a brain .
Okay . So where have we got to ?
But what I haven &apos;t explained is what sleep is about .
So why do we sleep ?
It &apos;s gone in and out of fashion .
So there &apos;s good evidence for the whole restoration hypothesis .
What about energy conservation ?
Again , perhaps intuitive .
You essentially sleep to save calories .
Now , that &apos;s the equivalent of a hot dog bun .
So I &apos;m less convinced by the energy conservation idea .
It &apos;s really hugely attenuated .
So sleep and memory consolidation is also very important .
Sleeping at night enhances our creativity .
But sleep is not an indulgence .
It &apos;s not even an upgrade from economy to first class .
So let &apos;s now look at sleep deprivation .
For teenagers , it &apos;s worse , much worse .
It &apos;s simply not enough .
So who here has jet lag ?
Well , my goodness gracious .
A hundred thousand a year . It &apos;s extraordinary .
But my friends , it &apos;s so much worse than that .
Well , of course , you then resort to alcohol .
It can actually ease the sleep transition .
Another connection between loss of sleep is weight gain .
What &apos;s the connection here ?
Ghrelin is released . It gets to the brain .
Stress . Tired people are massively stressed .
But stress is so much more .
Increased levels of stress throw glucose into the circulation .
Therefore , diabetes 2 .
Stress increases cardiovascular disease as a result of raising blood pressure .
So a quick show of hands .
Who feels that they &apos;re getting enough sleep here ?
Oh . Well , that &apos;s pretty impressive .
Well , it &apos;s not rocket science .
Listen to them . Listen to yourself .
What do you do ?
Light increases levels of alertness and will delay sleep .
Turn off those mobile phones . Turn off those computers .
So seek out morning light .
Basically , listen to yourself .
Okay . That &apos;s some facts . What about some myths ?
Teenagers are lazy . No . Poor things .
We need eight hours of sleep a night .
And what you need to do is listen to your body .
Do you need that much or do you need more ?
Simple as that .
Old people need less sleep . Not true .
The sleep demands of the aged do not go down .
Well that &apos;s wrong at so many different levels .
There &apos;s no difference in socioeconomic status .
So what &apos;s going on ?
Other groups showed no 24-hour patterns whatsoever .
Their sleep was absolutely smashed .
So what &apos;s going on ?
And what &apos;s the evidence for that ?
Other work flowed from these studies .
So what have we got ?
So let me just finish .
What I started by saying is take sleep seriously .
We used to understand intuitively the importance of sleep .
And this isn &apos;t some sort of crystal-waving nonsense .
This is a pragmatic response to good health .
And I can only recommend that you do the same .
Thank you for your attention .
Craig Venter : Watch me unveil &quot; synthetic life &quot;
But we &apos;ll talk more about the watermarks in a minute .
You can only do them one at a time .
That started our 15-year quest to get here .
In 2003 , we published our first success .
That little issue took the team two years to solve .
So accuracy is essential .
And then early one morning , at 6 a.m.
It &apos;s a James Joyce quote .
Yes , in the back .
Craig Venter : Can we explain how significant this is ?
It &apos;s significant to us .
We need some alternatives for oil .
Julia Sweeney : Letting go of God
All that being good and no real credit for it .
Now , this was actually not that upsetting to me .
Which made me very suspicious .
I ran up to him and said , &quot; Bill !
Which was comforting , but troubling .
And this meant that I was a Libra ?
Oh , life can be so cruel .
One day , two Mormon missionaries came to my door .
Don &apos;t touch my hair , that &apos;s the thing .
He led them to America .
And they said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Well , I was just on the edge of my seat .
I said , &quot; What happened to the Lamanites ? &quot;
What is this wonderful gift God gave women , I wondered ?
Maybe their greater ability to cooperate and adapt ?
What if you had a nose job and you liked it ?
Would God force you to get your old nose back ?
I &apos;m just so used to that story .
Roy Gould + Curtis Wong : A preview of the WorldWide Telescope
Harvard was wrong , big time .
We &apos;re going to have a personal universe .
Well , our gaze fills the universe .
Thank you .
Curtis Wong : Thank you , Roy .
And actually this tour is one that was created earlier .
The whole resources are there available for you .
So basically , kids of all ages , like us .
And so WorldWide Telescope will be available this spring .
So we &apos;ll see you there . Thank you .
Jane Poynter : Life in Biosphere 2
I have had the distinct pleasure of living inside two biospheres .
I &apos;ve also lived in Biosphere 2 .
And hopefully from that I get to learn something .
We had a savanna , a marsh , a desert .
I mean , what is a biosphere ?
But of course none of that happened .
But by 1991 we finally had this thing built .
We needed to know , is life this malleable ?
Big questions .
Let &apos;s take it on a maiden voyage .
More on that later .
And this is the world that we lived in .
This is the agriculture .
It was essentially an organic farm .
At that moment I became part of that biosphere .
And we ate an awful lot of the sweet potatoes .
And those sweet potatoes became part of me .
I literally was eating the same carbon over and over again .
I was eating myself in some strange sort of bizarre way .
And so we were working to sequester carbon .
Good lord -- we know that term now .
We were growing plants like crazy .
We were trying to stop carbon from going into the atmosphere .
We stopped irrigating our soil , as much as we could .
And it was like playing atomic hide-and-seek .
We had lost seven tons of oxygen .
And we had no clue where it was .
I mean we were dragging ourselves around the Biosphere .
And we had sleep apnea at night .
And everybody outside thought we were dying .
And it was time for us to put oxygen in .
Yes . In a sense it was terrifying .
Not me , that was for sure .
And we did indeed find it .
And we found it in the concrete .
Essentially it had done something very simple .
And nothing else emerged that really was as serious as that .
And we proved the concept , more or less .
People , on the other hand , was a different subject .
We all went quite nuts , I will say .
For two years I &apos;d been seeing people through the glass .
And everybody ran up to me .
And I recoiled . They stank !
People stink !
And boy do we stink out here .
I had been growing all my own food .
People must have thought I was nuts .
It was really quite astonishing .
And so we sent one onto the Mir Space Station .
It is so dry .
This is what I saw .
But this is also what I saw .
And it will produce a food crop .
In this case it was oilseed .
And all of it was coming from this : shrimp farms .
They pour huge amounts of pollutants into the ocean .
They also pollute their next-door neighbors .
They were literally turning pollution into abundance for a desert people .
They had created an industrial ecosystem , of a sense .
Kyoto Protocol system .
In a mangrove forest like this I have no idea .
And understand its interactions with the entire Earth .
And put your project in that context .
And here the light green are areas of massive deforestation .
Now it may not seem like it , but we are .
And I think often times people get lost in that .
It &apos;s such a huge subject . &quot;
This is the story of a rake in my backyard .
And in Arizona , of course , everybody puts gravel down .
It &apos;s a certain type of aesthetic .
We &apos;re very uncomfortable with untidiness .
And I threw away my rake .
And over time , essentially what have I been doing ?
I &apos;ve been building topsoil .
And I have an oasis .
This is actually in a riparian area .
The small stuff counts .
The yogis had it right .
Take a breath now .
It also connects us in time .
There may be some carbon in your breath from the dinosaurs .
Thank you .
Phil Plait : How to defend Earth from asteroids
I want to talk to you about something kind of big .
We &apos;ll start here .
65 million years ago the dinosaurs had a bad day .
The dinosaurs had a really bad day .
Okay ?
Now , a six-mile-wide rock is very large .
We all live here in Boulder .
Here is how big of a crater was left .
It wiped out 75 percent of all species on Earth .
Now , not all asteroids are that big .
Some of them are smaller .
It came in on a Friday night .
Why is that important ?
That would be bad .
So it &apos;s about a mile across , 600 feet deep .
This did a huge amount of damage .
They &apos;re not going to do something like the dinosaur-killer did .
They &apos;re just not big enough .
They don &apos;t have to do global devastation .
what can we do about this ? All right ?
This is a potential threat .
Well , what do we do about them ?
The first thing we have to do is find them .
It &apos;s right here .
But you can see that it &apos;s extremely faint .
These things are faint .
We have to find these things first .
Well the good news is , we &apos;re looking for them .
NASA has devoted money to this .
Apophis is an asteroid that was discovered in 2004 .
I don &apos;t think Apophis is a problem .
Right ? Move . The car goes past you .
And it turns out , we &apos;ve even done it .
Comets are very much like asteroids .
The purpose wasn &apos;t to push it out of the way .
However , think about this .
Imagine how hard that must be , and we did it .
That means we can do it again .
But just hitting something ? That &apos;s pretty easy .
Well , my opinion is , fine . Okay ?
Now we have three years to do something else .
Instead you get near it .
But we &apos;d be rich !
So think about this , right ?
This probe actually can &apos;t use chemical rockets .
Yeah , we have an ion drive now .
Spock .
So ...
This happened to them .
It doesn &apos;t have to happen to us .
We have the ability to change our future .
Thank you very much .
LZ Granderson : The myth of the gay agenda
He was in a movie called &quot; Torch Song Trilogy . &quot;
That &apos;s when I got scared .
I drink coffee .
I get stuck in traffic -- evil , evil traffic .
Sometimes I get stuck in lines at airports .
This is the gay lifestyle .
This is the super duper evil gay lifestyle .
Run for your heterosexual lives , people .
And sometimes I just wear it just because .
You might be gay .
It goes and goes and engulfs !
It &apos;s really quite silly , isn &apos;t it ?
It &apos;s wonderful .
What are these gays up to ?
What do they want ? &quot;
The gay agenda , people !
There it is !
Did you soak it all in ? The gay agenda .
The U.S. Constitution is the gay agenda .
But there it is . The gay agenda .
Run for your heterosexual lives .
I &apos;m looking at you , North Carolina .
But you &apos;re not looking at the U.S. Constitution .
Educated , well-dressed , some would dare say questionably dressed .
Nonetheless , our forefathers , right ?
All of that flies in the face of what they did .
He has a 4.0 .
He is starting a new club at school , Policy Debate .
He volunteers .
He prays before he eats .
We keep doing this over and over again .
Look to your right .
And they should be treated with love and respect .
Thank you .
Ze Frank : My web playroom
Every presentation needs this slide in it .
It &apos;s beautiful , isn &apos;t it ?
Do you see ?
All the points , all the lines -- it &apos;s incredible .
Isn &apos;t it amazing ?
Through that , I connect to people .
It &apos;s pretty incredible -- the video &apos;s online .
Connecting to people in projects like YoungmeNowme for example .
Poignant .
This was a Mother &apos;s Day gift .
Particularly creepy .
This is project called Ray .
Somebody said , &quot; You have to listen to this . &quot;
And this is what came to me .
Here &apos;s how the song goes .
All right . Stay strong . Peace .
Ze Frank : So -- yeah .
This was incredible ; this is what I wanted to do .
It &apos;s actually in the key of B flat .
And have to do something with it . &quot;
Hundreds of remixes came back -- lots of different attempts .
One stood out in particular .
It was done by a guy named Goose .
That song -- Thank you .
In two weeks , they found him .
I heard you were looking for me . &quot;
And I was like , &quot; Yeah , Ray .
It &apos;s been an interesting two weeks . &quot;
And it makes me think of this .
But the truth is life is being lived there .
It &apos;s the fundamental force that we &apos;re all after .
And that &apos;s not always going to happen in physical spaces .
Sometimes they &apos;re very , very simple things .
I guess the shoes came off when he was hit .
It had &apos; Chad &apos; written in magic marker on it .
Sometimes they &apos;re a little bit more abstract .
This is Pain Pack .
And people called in and left messages like this .
Recording : Okay , here &apos;s something .
I &apos;m not alone , and I am loved .
I &apos;m really fortunate .
But sometimes I feel really lonely .
We don &apos;t have time to play much of it .
You can look at it online .
Let &apos;s have people hold up signs about reconciliation . &quot;
And so some really nice things came together .
&quot; I voted blue . I voted red .
Together , for our future . &quot;
These are very , very cute little things right .
Some came from the winning party .
Some came from the party who had just lost .
But this was the emotional moment .
It &apos;s amazing .
So one of them was fairly straightforward .
And this was &quot; Scared . &quot;
And I don &apos;t have much time .
And I shut that part down .
I was like , &quot; I don &apos;t know .
Didn &apos;t know I had one . &quot;
And I felt badly for not having done a good job .
And so what I decided to do .
And this is the kind of thing that I got back .
I just want to say thanks for even considering it . &quot;
And then a few days later I sent her this .
Billy Collins : Two poems about what dogs think
Seven to one is the ratio , they tend to say .
Thank you .
The jingling of my tags drove me mad .
You always scratched me in the wrong place . &quot;
Thank you .
Sonaar Luthra : Meet the Water Canary
We call it the Water Canary .
It doesn &apos;t require any special training .
Thank you .
Abraham Verghese : A doctor &apos;s touch
Her blood pressure was an alarming 230 over 170 .
Within a few minutes , she went into cardiac collapse .
Ladies and gentlemen , that is not an unusual story .
Unfortunately , it happens all the time .
I am not a Luddite .
I teach at Stanford .
I &apos;m a physician practicing with cutting-edge technology .
We &apos;re losing a ritual .
This is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle .
Joseph Bell was an extraordinary teacher by all accounts .
The woman says , &quot; Good Morning . &quot;
She says , &quot; It was good . &quot;
She says , &quot; I did . &quot;
And she says , &quot; I am . &quot;
And Bell then goes on to explain to the students .
And the nearest ferry crossing from Fife is from Burntisland .
And so she must have taken the ferry over .
You notice the clay on the soles of her feet .
Later he renamed it the stethoscope .
And that is how stethoscope and auscultation was born .
He made no attempt at diagnosis .
And Tate asked Fildes to paint a painting of social importance .
And it &apos;s interesting that Fildes picked this topic .
I call it the iPatient .
The iPatient is getting wonderful care all across America .
The real patient often wonders , where is everyone ?
Who &apos;s in charge ?
The focus was around the patient .
The discussion is all about images on the computer , data .
And the one critical piece missing is that of the patient .
This is when I was in Texas .
And she was reluctant to tell me .
She said , &quot; The cancer center was wonderful .
They had her scanned inside out .
But to her , it mattered deeply .
I was very influenced by that anecdote .
I say that because these are difficult patients .
There was just no way .
And if I tried , I &apos;d disappoint them .
And I began my ritual .
This is real .
Something of importance had transpired in the exchange .
And they helped me understand that rituals are all about transformation .
I &apos;m not sure why you &apos;re laughing .
That was the original intent , was it not ?
We signal transitions of power with rituals .
We signal the passage of a life with rituals .
Rituals are terribly important .
They &apos;re all about transformation .
I would pull down the eyelids .
I would look at the tongue .
I would feel the abdomen .
It was an offering , an invitation .
I did not decline .
I percussed . I palpated . I listened to the chest .
I will see you through this .
I will never abandon you .
I will be with you through the end . &quot;
Thank you very much .
Benjamin Wallace : The price of happiness
I &apos;m just going to play a brief video clip .
And the mystery existed because of a gentleman named Hardy Rodenstock .
The mystery persisted for about 20 years .
So , I decided to embark on a quest .
This was the first one .
And it arrived , and it was tiny .
And I was outraged .
It was like , 160 dollars for this ?
I almost couldn &apos;t finish it .
I was really happy when I was done .
White truffles .
And the charm of white truffles is in their aroma .
It &apos;s in the smell .
10 seconds passed and it was gone .
There were several -- several of these items were disappointments .
Yeah .
The magazine wouldn &apos;t pay for me to go there .
They did give me a tour , though .
And this hotel suite is 4,300 square feet .
It has 360-degree views .
It has four balconies .
It was designed by the architect I.M. Pei .
It comes with its own Rolls Royce and driver .
30,000 dollars for a night in a hotel .
That said , a lot of work goes into these .
But no compliments .
Thank you .
It tasted fine . It tasted interesting .
It was very green , it was very peppery .
But in the blind taste test , it came in last .
Oh , yeah , you know this one ?
This is a coffee made from a very unusual process .
The luwak is an Asian Palm Civet .
That &apos;s right .
Unrelatedly -- Japan is doing crazy things with toilets .
There &apos;s one with a fragrance dispenser .
The seat is preheated .
There &apos;s a water jet that cleans you .
There &apos;s an air jet that dries you .
You get up , it flushes by itself .
The lid closes , it self-cleans .
I mean , a no hands , no toilet paper toilet .
And I want to get one of these .
This was another one I could not get a loaner of .
Tom Cruise supposedly owns this bed .
But anyway , we had a great night &apos;s sleep .
And you spend a third of your life in bed .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s that bad of a deal .
This was a fun one .
And it was really amazing .
It was such a smooth ride .
And if I was a billionaire , I would get one .
But it &apos;s 60 years old .
There &apos;s not much of it left .
And it was an invitation you do not refuse .
I went .
It was three days , four meals .
And at lunch on Saturday , we opened the &apos; 47 .
There were some people who were a little less impressed .
And I wasn &apos;t that impressed .
And it wasn &apos;t just to that wine .
Thank you .
Sugata Mitra : The child-driven education
Well , that &apos;s kind of an obvious statement up there .
Make yourself understood to the computer . &quot;
And I left .
In other words , they were all speaking like James Tooley .
So they could do that on their own .
And he couldn &apos;t travel , so I went over there .
And when you &apos;ve got interest , then you have education .
Sugata Mitra : I took the experiment to South Africa .
This is a 15 year-old boy .
They would , you know , throw it back at you .
They &apos;d say , &quot; This is very boring . &quot;
This is what these children are doing .
They are trying to multiply , I think .
And indeed they had .
I wanted to test the limits of the system .
I called in 26 children .
I wouldn &apos;t be surprised if you didn &apos;t understand anything .
It &apos;s all in English , and I &apos;m going .
So I left them with it .
They said , &quot; Yes , we did . &quot;
They said , &quot; We look at it every day . &quot;
It took me three years to publish that .
And then that &apos;s her over there .
Remember , they don &apos;t study English .
Whatever the expression , it was not very nice .
But 30 percent is not a pass .
She said , &quot; What &apos;s that ? &quot;
Approximately 5,000 miles from Delhi is the little town of Gateshead .
I made them into groups of four .
I said , &quot; You make your own groups of four .
Remember , from the Hole in the Wall .
&quot; You can exchange groups .
I gave them six GCSE questions .
The worst , in 45 .
The teachers said , &quot; Is this deep learning ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Well , let &apos;s try it .
I &apos;ll come back after two months .
200 of them volunteered immediately .
The granny cloud sits over there .
I can beam them to whichever school I want to .
Teacher : You can &apos;t catch me .
You say it .
You can &apos;t catch me .
Children : You can &apos;t catch me .
Teacher : I &apos;m the gingerbread man .
Children : I &apos;m the gingerbread man .
Teacher : Well done . Very good ...
You know , stuff which I don &apos;t know anything about .
Two children watch a TEDTalk .
They wanted to be footballers before .
It &apos;s pretty simple stuff .
If they want , they can call the granny cloud .
This is a SOLE in Newcastle .
The mediator is from Pune , India .
I went to Turin in May .
I started writing English questions on the blackboard .
The children looked at it and said , &quot; What ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Well , do it . &quot;
Fifteen minutes later -- next question : where is Calcutta ?
This one , they took only 10 minutes .
I tried a really hard one then .
Who was Pythagoras , and what did he do ?
It &apos;s Pitagora . &quot;
This sent shivers up my spine .
These are 10 year-olds .
SM : So you know what &apos;s happened ?
I think we &apos;ve just stumbled across a self-organizing system .
But in the meanwhile , there is a method available .
We could change everything .
Thanks .
Gary Kovacs : Tracking our online trackers
So let me expose this lurking industry a little bit further .
And this is my profile .
Now let me stop here .
I have navigated to a total of four .
So let me fast-forward through the rest of my day .
The red dots have exploded .
The gray dots have grown exponentially .
I look at this picture and it freaks me out .
This is nothing . I am being stalked across the Web .
And why is this happening ?
Pretty simple -- it &apos;s huge business .
And as adults , we &apos;re certainly not alone .
This is a nine-year-old girl navigating to principally children &apos;s sites .
I move from this , from freaked out to enraged .
We can &apos;t sit idly by here either .
This is happening today .
Our voices matter and our actions matter even more .
Today we &apos;ve launched Collusion .
Going forward , all of our voices need to be heard .
Because what we don &apos;t know can actually hurt us .
Because the memory of the Internet is forever .
We are being watched .
It &apos;s now time for us to watch the watchers .
Thank you .
Britta Riley : A garden in my apartment
And some days , that can even be a little scary .
But I can offer some natural light and year-round climate control .
So actually now on this website , we have 18,000 people .
And we have window farms all over the world .
Now within our community , a certain culture has appeared .
Open source projects tend to have a momentum of their own .
Peter Norvig : The 100,000-student classroom
Everyone is both a learner and a teacher .
Just like today .
And that grew to 160,000 students from 209 countries .
So we got to work .
And that &apos;s exactly what we were aiming for .
We decided to go even shorter and more interactive .
Students learn best when they &apos;re actively practicing .
We preferred open-ended questions .
And I like that kind of response .
That &apos;s just what we were going for .
And we succeeded .
Or , I should say , the students succeeded .
Most online classes , the videos are always available .
You can watch them any time you want .
So we brought back the innovation of having due dates .
Sebastian and I have forgotten some of that .
More important is motivation and determination .
They got this statement of accomplishment .
So what have we learned ?
Sebastian &apos;s teaching another class now .
I &apos;ll do one in the fall .
It &apos;s a really exciting time .
Margaret Heffernan : The dangers of &quot; willful blindness &quot;
It struck her as strange .
He &apos;d been a miner .
It was an anomaly , and she kept puzzling over anomalies .
And as she did , other ones came to mind .
She thought about her town .
The town had a vermiculite mine in it .
Vermiculite was in the playground .
It was in the football ground .
It was in the skating rink .
But she was really amazed .
But Gayla didn &apos;t stop . She kept doing research .
The advent of the Internet definitely helped her .
She talked to anybody she could .
So now she had an ally .
Nevertheless , people still didn &apos;t want to know .
It &apos;s lined with vermiculite . &quot;
This wasn &apos;t ignorance .
It was willful blindness .
You have chosen not to know .
There &apos;s a lot of willful blindness around these days .
Eighty-five percent . That &apos;s a lot of silence .
It &apos;s a lot of blindness .
And the truth is , this is a human problem .
We &apos;re all , under certain circumstances , willfully blind .
Nothing &apos;s ever going to change .
Better not to see this stuff at all .
They are crushed .
Nobody would want to go through something like that . &quot;
I think of Joe Darby .
The really important thing about Gayla is she is ordinary .
She &apos;s like you , and she &apos;s like me .
Thank you very much .
Nellie McKay : &quot; The Dog Song &quot;
Thank you .
Eleanor Longden : The voices in my head
&quot; She is opening the door . &quot;
This was the beginning . The voice had arrived .
&quot; She is going to the library . &quot;
&quot; She is going to a lecture . &quot;
Such fear and mistrust was infectious .
I spent some time telling the college G.P.
I &apos;m reading the news at six . &quot;
You see that glass of water ?
Two years later , and the deterioration was dramatic .
I believe that Eleanor can get through this .
Now at first , I would have believed them .
It was like , &quot; Don &apos;t mess with me .
Strategic .
So it &apos;s not all bad .
You cannot humiliate the person who feels pride .
You cannot oppress the people who are not afraid anymore .
We are unique . We are irreplaceable .
The light never goes out .
Tell me about you . &quot;
Thank you .
Thank you .
Hi , everybody .
Ban-gap-seum-ni-da .
Do you feel like you are all alone ?
Thank you .
It &apos;s such an honor for me .
But it &apos;s now your turn .
Play your life , and stay tuned .
Julian Treasure : 5 ways to listen better
We are losing our listening .
We retain just 25 percent of what we hear .
Let &apos;s define listening as making meaning from sound .
We use some pretty cool techniques to do this .
One of them is pattern recognition .
Differencing is another technique we use .
And then there is a whole range of filters .
Most people are entirely unconscious of these filters .
But it &apos;s a great intention to have in a relationship .
But that &apos;s not all .
Sound places us in space and in time .
I said at the beginning , we &apos;re losing our listening .
Why did I say that ?
Well there are a lot of reasons for this .
The premium on accurate and careful listening has simply disappeared .
In this scenario , nobody &apos;s listening to anybody .
We &apos;re becoming impatient .
We don &apos;t want oratory anymore , we want sound bites .
We &apos;re becoming desensitized .
This is a serious problem that we &apos;re losing our listening .
This is not trivial .
Because listening is our access to understanding .
Conscious listening always creates understanding .
Would you like that ?
Good .
The first one is silence .
Second , I call this the mixer .
How many individual channels in that mix am I listening to ?
How many birds am I hearing ?
Where are they ? Where are those ripples ?
It &apos;s about enjoying mundane sounds .
This , for example , is my tumble dryer .
It &apos;s a waltz .
I love it .
Or just try this one on for size .
Wow !
So mundane sounds can be really interesting if you pay attention .
I call that the hidden choir .
It &apos;s around us all the time .
This is playing with those filters .
There are many .
Have fun with that . It &apos;s very exciting .
And finally , an acronym .
You can use this in listening , in communication .
Now sound is my passion , it &apos;s my life .
That &apos;s too much to ask from most people .
Why is it not taught ? It &apos;s crazy .
Thank you for listening to me today .
Nora York : Singing &quot; What I Want &quot;
Noreena Hertz : How to use experts -- and when not to
It &apos;s Monday morning .
This is no exaggeration .
The results were quite extraordinary .
It literally flat-lined .
But experts do get things wrong .
But how can we do this ?
This doesn &apos;t mean having to get a Ph.D.
in every single subject , you &apos;ll be relieved to hear .
What is the evidence upon which this is based ?
What has your investigation focused on ?
And what has it ignored ?
Google CEO Eric Schmidt is a practical practitioner of this philosophy .
But we need to go even further .
We need to fundamentally redefine who it is that experts are .
Thank you .
Andrew Mwenda : Aid for Africa ? No thanks .
It is the G8 Summit .
Unfortunately , I personally do not believe in the Marshall Plan .
However , the media is not telling us the whole truth .
And secondly , they are the smallest reality .
Africa has 53 nations .
It appeals to pity . It appeals to something called charity .
We should deliver medicines to those who are ill .
And in the process , Africa has been stripped of self-initiative .
But equally , it has opportunities and a lot of potential .
It should be a challenge of creating wealth .
But they also succeed at the job of entrepreneurship .
So , where should we be putting the money ?
We need to put money where it can productively grow .
Support private investment in Africa , both domestic and foreign .
But what is the international aid community doing with Africa today ?
By holding the begging bowl and receiving alms ?
Does any one of you in the audience have that person ?
Which country is that ?
External actors can only present to you an opportunity .
Africa has received many opportunities .
Many of them we haven &apos;t benefited much .
We haven &apos;t exported one kilogram yet .
We import 50,000 metric tons of sugar from Brazil and Cuba .
Aid is the bad instrument , and do you know why ?
Because all governments across the world need money to survive .
Why should people support their government ?
Many countries in the &#91; unclear &#93; , they need legitimacy .
Governments are not changing it . Why ?
Because they don &apos;t need to talk to their own citizens .
They talk to international donors .
Where has all the aid gone ?
In the 2006-2007 budget , expected revenue : 2.5 trillion shillings .
The expected foreign aid : 1.9 trillion .
Uganda &apos;s recurrent expenditure -- by recurrent what do I mean ?
Hand-to-mouth is 2.6 trillion .
Public administration , which is largely patronage , takes 690 billion .
The military , 380 billion .
Trade and industry takes 43 billion .
We have 81 units of local government .
Three hundred thirty-three members of parliament .
You need Wembley Stadium to host our parliament .
I hope I have achieved that .
Thank you very much .
AJ Jacobs : How healthy living nearly killed me
And I &apos;ve done this in three parts .
So first I started with the mind .
And here &apos;s a little image of that .
And this was an amazing year .
It was really a fascinating journey .
It was painful at times , especially for those around me .
So it had its downsides .
But after that , I decided to work on the spirit .
Not really .
So I decided to follow all the rules of the Bible .
So this is what I looked like by the end .
Thank you for that reaction .
I look a little like Moses , or Ted Kaczynski .
I got both of them .
So there was the topiary there .
And there &apos;s the sheep .
And I just finished a couple of months ago .
And I have to say , thank God .
Because living so healthily was killing me .
I had to put on sunscreen .
And you have to reapply it every two to four hours .
So I think half of my book advance went into sunscreen .
I was like a glazed doughnut for most of the year .
There was the washing of hands .
I had to do that properly .
So that took a lot of time .
I was inspired by the Danish Safety Council .
And you can see there they &apos;re shopping with their helmets .
Well yeah , I tried that .
Now it &apos;s a little extreme , I admit .
All of the markers went in the right direction .
So that was nice .
And it was successful overall .
So I finished .
It was like something out of Caligula .
Without the sex part .
But the over-eating and over-drinking , definitely .
And I finally have stabilized .
It was really a life-changing project .
Let me just tell you two really quickly .
Because we live in such a noisy world .
A loud noise will get your fight-or-flight response going .
And it was done in Europe .
So they think it &apos;s actually very deadly .
It really impairs cognition .
And our Founding Fathers knew about this .
So without noise reduction technology , our country would not exist .
And just to give you one instance of this : food .
To give just one example , we love crunchiness , mouthfeel .
And it has made me a healthier person .
So that is it .
The book about it comes out in April .
It &apos;s called &quot; Drop Dead Healthy . &quot;
That &apos;s my greatest hope .
So thank you very much .
Peter Reinhart : The art and craft of bread
With whole grain bread , you have other obstacles .
Flavor is king . Flavor rules .
I call it the flavor rule . Flavor rules .
So , this is the challenge for this bread .
It &apos;s just dough that is wet .
It starts to release the sugars trapped in the starch .
That &apos;s what enzymes are doing .
They become accessible to the yeast as food .
The other pre-dough that we make is fermented -- our pre-ferment .
Okay , we &apos;re going to start with the first stage .
And this is what every student has to begin with .
Everything in its place . First stage .
We have to develop the gluten .
It &apos;s yeast burps and sweat .
But then , quickly through the next few stages .
That &apos;s called &quot; rounding . &quot;
This takes a second , but it &apos;s a distinctive stage .
And then , stage nine .
The final fermentation takes place in stage nine .
We call it &quot; proofing . &quot;
Proofing means to prove that the dough is alive .
Three transformations take place in the oven .
The sugars in the dough caramelize in the crust .
They give us that beautiful brown crust .
Inside , the proteins -- this gluten -- coagulates .
And gelatinization is yet another oven transformation .
There &apos;s a little carry-over baking .
The proteins have to set up , strengthen and firm up .
And fulfilling this mission of evoking the full potential of flavor .
It &apos;s just a euphemism for killing , right ?
We can plant those in the ground .
And we save some of those for the next generation .
But most of those seeds get crushed and turned into flour .
So we turn it into flour .
O.K. ? Radical , not subtle .
That &apos;s a transformation , two different things .
I &apos;d call that radical .
So , we &apos;ve got now this flour .
And what do we do ? We add some water .
In stage one , we weigh it .
It &apos;s like clay .
Enzymes are breaking forth sugars .
And at stage 10 , we take it to the oven .
Third transformation . First transformation , alive to dead .
Second transformation , dead brought back to life .
Third transformation , alive to dead -- but dough to bread .
It &apos;s used as a symbol for transformation .
So this is what I &apos;ve learned from bread .
This is what bread has taught me in my journey .
Beer is basically liquid bread , or bread is solid beer .
May your crust be crisp , and your bread always rise .
Thank you .
Between music and medicine
Thank you very much .
Thank you . It &apos;s a distinct privilege to be here .
Music transcends the aesthetic beauty alone .
Thomas Suarez : A 12-year-old app developer
I &apos;d like to share a couple with you today .
For violin , you could get lessons for a violin .
But what if you want to make an app ?
This is so I can share my experiences with others .
I &apos;m fortunate enough to be part of one .
Dean Ornish : Your genes are not your fate
Another is to change our lifestyles .
But more than that , your brain gets measurably bigger .
I &apos;m just the messenger .
What were we just talking about ?
Your heart gets more blood flow .
We &apos;ve shown that you can actually reverse heart disease .
A year later -- orange and white is maximum blood flow .
These differences were highly significant .
Half of guys who smoke are impotent .
How sexy is that ?
Thank you .
Michael Norton : How to buy happiness
And a lot of us resonate with this phrase .
We had a little natural experiment .
This article &apos;s about how their lives get ruined .
And it ruins their social relationships , in fact .
and fantasizing about what they &apos;d do .
So the first way that we did this .
They said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Also inside the envelope was money .
And we manipulated how much money we gave them .
So some people got this slip of paper and five dollars .
Some people got this slip of paper and 20 dollars .
What did they spend it on ?
One woman said she bought a stuffed animal for her niece .
People gave money to homeless people .
Huge effect here of Starbucks .
People who spent money on other people got happier .
People who spent money on themselves , nothing happened .
Describe it . How happy did it make you ? &quot;
And then we asked them how happy they are again .
So for example , one guy from Uganda says this .
Here &apos;s a guy from Canada .
Very similar thing .
&quot; I took my girlfriend out for dinner .
Maybe you have something in mind , maybe not .
But then we see extraordinary differences .
So look at these two .
This is a woman from Canada .
She says , &quot; I bought a present for my mom .
Perfectly nice thing to do .
It &apos;s good to get gifts for people that you know .
Compare that to this woman from Uganda .
This isn &apos;t $ 10,000 , it &apos;s the local currency .
But enormously different motivations here .
This is a real medical need , literally a life-saving donation .
These are only two countries .
Are they positively correlated ? Giving money makes you happy .
Or are they negatively correlated ?
And you can see , the world is crazily green .
So these are sales teams in Belgium .
But other teams we say , &quot; Here &apos;s 15 euro .
Spend it on one of your teammates this week .
You don &apos;t get any money from that .
And we did the exact same thing as before .
And we luckily have an opportunity for you .
You and I can go on and buy it for them .
Sometimes they send you pictures of them using the microscope .
It &apos;s an extraordinary thing .
Thank you .
Emmanuel Jal : The music of a war child
I just want to say my name is Emmanuel Jal .
And I come from a long way .
And also telling it like now .
So I have branded myself as a war child .
I saw my village burned down .
I saw my aunt in rape when I was only five .
My mother was claimed by the war .
My brothers and sisters were scattered .
And that made me call myself a war child .
I didn &apos;t know what was the war for .
I wanted to revenge for my village .
So that pain has gone out .
But my story is huge .
I talk about my story .
And only 16 people survived that journey .
So I hope you &apos;re going to hear this .
My dreams are like torment .
My every moment .
Voices in my brain , of friends that was slain .
Friends like Lual who died by my side , of starvation .
In the burning jungle , and the desert plain .
Next was I , but Jesus heard my cry .
I knew it was rude , but we needed food .
Sometimes you gotta lose to win .
Never give up . Never give in .
Left home at the age of seven .
One year later , live with an AK-47 by my side .
Slept with one eye open wide .
Run , duck , play dead and hide .
I &apos;ve seen my people die like flies .
But still as I wonder , I won &apos;t go under .
Guns barking like lightning and thunder .
I carry the banner of the trauma .
I &apos;m on a fight , day and night .
Sometime I do wrong in order to make things right .
It &apos;s like I &apos;m living a dream .
First time I &apos;m feeling like a human being .
Ah ! The children of Darfur .
Left home .
Don &apos;t even know the day I &apos;ll ever return .
My country is war-torn .
Music I used to hear was bombs and fire of guns .
Ask God question , what am I here for .
And why are my people poor .
I was ready to eat .
That &apos;s my story shared in the form of a lesson .
Thank you .
So the music had been my therapy for me .
I hated the people in the north .
So we party and dance to their music .
And I almost broke my leg dancing to his music .
But I had this question .
So what &apos;s happening here ?
I &apos;ve been in a painful journey .
Today is day number 233 in which I only eat dinner .
I don &apos;t eat breakfast . No lunch .
And I &apos;ve done a campaign called Lose to Win .
Here I am in the West . I choose not to .
So it &apos;s taken me 232 days .
And like it &apos;s been done on Facebook , MySpace .
The people are giving three dollars .
The lowest amount we ever got was 20 cents .
Somebody donated 20 cents online .
I don &apos;t know how they did it .
But that moved me .
As a nation we have been crippled .
For so many years we have fed on aid .
You see a 20-years-old , 30-years-old families in a refugee camps .
If anybody want to help us this is what we need .
Give us tools . Give the farmers tools .
Invest in education .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m asking .
And now we have a couple in university .
She came to my country and saw the importance of education .
So she even ended up marrying a commander from the SPLA .
And she rescued over 150 child soldiers .
One of them happened to be me now .
Are you guys ready to celebrate Emma ?
Audience : Yes !
Emmanuel Jal : All right .
Big scream for Emma everybody .
Yeah ! I &apos;m gonna get crazy now .
Go save a life of a child .
Blaise Agüera y Arcas : Augmented-reality maps
It &apos;s wonderful .
These little green bubbles represent photosynths that users have made .
So this one was taken around five .
So that &apos;s the Flickr photo , that &apos;s our imagery .
Thank you .
OK , notice there &apos;s now a roof above us .
We &apos;re inside the Pike Place Market .
OK .
All right , guys , are you there ?
I &apos;m live . All right . There we go .
So they &apos;re broadcasting this live .
Because I want to show points of interest .
No , no . The other way .
I don &apos;t want to see you guys yet .
OK , never mind .
What the hell are you guys -- oh , sorry .
We &apos;re doing two different things here .
One of them is to take that real ...
They &apos;ve done a fantastic job of pulling this together .
I &apos;m going to abandon them now and walk back outside .
And that &apos;s Curtis Wong , WorldWide Telescope .
This is the integration of WorldWide Telescope into our maps .
I would like to kind of zoom in on the moon .
Thank you all very much .
Peter Gabriel : Fight injustice with raw video
still exists back home .
At first , we were safe in the camp .
But later the government soldiers began mistreating us a lot .
Evelyn and I hid behind my mother .
The other soldier also came .
Jennifer : The man came and started undressing me .
The other one carried Evelyn aside .
They insisted that I was lying .
At that moment , they fired and shot off my fingers .

Paul Nicklen : Tales of ice-bound wonderlands
We didn &apos;t even have a telephone .
It &apos;s a spirit bear , or a Kermode bear .
There are only 200 of these bears left .
They &apos;re more rare than the panda bear .
I thought , my career &apos;s over .
I proposed this stupid story to National Geographic .
What in the heck was I thinking ?
Please enjoy .
My clock is ticking . Okay , let &apos;s stop .
Thank you very much . I appreciate it .
And what does that mean ?
You glaze over with it .
Polar bears are amazing hunters .
There was no ice around .
We &apos;re finding more and more dead bears in the Arctic .
They &apos;re not going to die of hypothermia .
They &apos;re going to get to land .
And here &apos;s a picture of sick ice .
And here we are diving in the Beaufort Sea .
Losing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden .
Here &apos;s me in my office .
I hope you appreciate yours .
This is after an hour under the ice .
Which means , &quot; Take my camera . &quot;
So we had this little communication breakdown .
But it &apos;s worth it .
This is a bowhead whale .
This very whale right here could be over 250 years old .
It could have survived 150 years of whaling .
Alright , my favorite part .
They &apos;ve got that wryly smile on their mouth .
They look positively prehistoric and a bit scary .
And so people love to form their opinions .
So this is that story .
Oh , and they also happen to eat happy feet .
It doesn &apos;t work that way .
This is just the food chain unfolding .
They &apos;re also big .
They &apos;re not these little harbor seals .
They are 12 ft. long , a thousand pounds .
And they &apos;re also curiously aggressive .
I &apos;m with my Swedish assistant and guide .
His name is Goran Ehlme from Sweden -- Goran .
And we &apos;re trying to not fall in the water .
It &apos;s time for you to get in the water . &quot;
But he was right .
And you purposed this stupid story to National Geographic .
And now you &apos;ve got to deliver .
And you can &apos;t publish excuses . &quot;
And this was the first thing she did .
But I just started to shoot these pictures .
She went off , she got a penguin .
The penguin swims toward me , takes off .
She grabs another one . She does this over and over .
Why else would she release these penguins at me ?
This didn &apos;t work .
And so that didn &apos;t work .
This went on for four days .
This just didn &apos;t happen a couple of times .
Because she can &apos;t believe I can &apos;t eat this penguin .
But yet she didn &apos;t stop .
She would not stop trying to feed me penguins .
And I thought , she &apos;s about to bite .
I get emotional . Sorry .
And I &apos;m so passionate about it .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thanks very much .
Thank you .
Maria Bezaitis : The surprising need for strangeness
&quot; Don &apos;t talk to strangers . &quot;
It &apos;s a norm . It &apos;s a social norm .
Stick with the people you know .
Stick with people like you . &quot;
How appealing is that ?
Why not strangers ?
Because strangers are part of a world of really rigid boundaries .
The question isn &apos;t whether or not I know you .
The question is , what can I do with you ?
What can I learn with you ?
What can we do together that benefits us both ?
The economies of the future depend on that .
Our social lives in the future depend on that .
The threat to worry about isn &apos;t strangers .
His point was that strangers are out there .
They produce sameness .
People aren &apos;t close or distant .
Strangeness is not about meeting strangers .
We have to change the norms .
How might we think differently about our relations with people ?
The range of digital relations is extraordinary .
Thank you .
Eve Ensler : Suddenly , my body
Me was always trying to become something , somebody .
Me only existed in the trying .
My body was often in the way .
Me was a floating head .
For years , I actually only wore hats .
It was a way of keeping my head attached .
It was a way of locating myself .
I never had babies because heads cannot give birth .
Babies actually don &apos;t come out of your mouth .
I did this in front of many strangers .
One night on stage , I actually entered my vagina .
It was an ecstatic experience .
I would drive it and demand things from it .
It had no limits . It was invincible .
It was to be conquered and mastered like the Earth herself .
I was greedy .
I took more than my body had to offer .
If I was tired , I drank more espressos .
If I was afraid , I went to more dangerous places .
Some women became quiet and disappeared .
Other women became mad , driven machines like me .
Well my stomach -- it was my stomach I hated .
Then I went somewhere else .
I went outside what I thought I knew .
I went to the Democratic Republic of Congo .
And I heard stories that shattered all the other stories .
I heard stories that got inside my body .
All the stories began to bleed together .
It arrived like a speeding bird smashing into a windowpane .
Cancer exploded the wall of my disconnection .
Before cancer , the world was something other .
Now I am swimming in it .
And gratefully , it didn &apos;t .
And she died quietly in her favorite place .
And I was honored .
And she said , &quot; It &apos;s for you .
And I said , &quot; Of course it is . &quot;
And she sang -- I mean her whole body sang .
It was all the lies that got told before and after .
It was my whole self melting into Michaela &apos;s lap .
It was finally being in my body .
It was the sorrow that &apos;s taken so long .
It was the Congolese women who are now rising up .
It was advocating friends and a doting sister .
It was underpaid and really loving nurses .
It was magic healers and aromatic oils .
It was people who came with spells and rituals .
It was a million prayers .
It was a thousand hallelujahs and a million oms .
It was energy , love and joy .
It was all these things .
It was all these things .
Tania Luna : How a penny made me feel like a millionaire
I &apos;m five years old , and I am very proud .
Five years later , an unexpected silver lining .
Thanks to Chernobyl , we get asylum in the U.S.
And in that moment , I feel like a millionaire .
Everyone &apos;s upset .
But the pizza is delicious .
And we were shocked .
My husband Brian was also homeless as a kid .
But he did have one thing .
This is Scarlett .
Thank you .
Barry Schuler : Genomics 101
And that moved us to the next level .
And we &apos;ve seen many seminal moments .
You &apos;re walking around ; your car has 12 microprocessors .
People never want to say , I really don &apos;t understand .
So , I will tell you right off of the bat .
There is a historical archive .
But also , the genome is really the instruction manual .
It is the program . It is the code of life .
DNA is a very elegant molecule .
It &apos;s long and it &apos;s complicated .
So , let &apos;s talk about what that means .
It &apos;s not really all that much data .
I will also tell you we &apos;re at least as buggy .
We are starting to understand that .
What is the code ?
What are the exact instructions that are making it do that ?
We actually have about 24,000 genes that do things .
So , we are now able to read genomes .
The first human genome took 10 years , three billion dollars .
It was done by Dr. Craig Venter .
They &apos;re going to make all that stuff go away .
What does a genome look like ?
Because what Nature is doing is double-clicking all the time .
Well , there &apos;s many things . Some are exciting .
We can understand functionality . This is really important .
The toolbox exists .
Well , guess what . It does .
Well , actually , you could do it the other way .
And this is extremely profound .
They &apos;ve identified areas of vulnerability to disease .
So , then what do you do ?
We can build a better vine .
We could produce better flavors and aromas .
But there &apos;s an ecosystem here .
We can start to figure that out .
We can figure out what the heck terroir is .
It &apos;s in there , waiting to be sequenced .
There are thousands of microbes there .
And then we understand what is terroir .
I don &apos;t believe that chemicals are unnatural .
They &apos;re here . They &apos;re in the universe .
There are microbes , you know -- go back to yeast .
There also is a set of rules .
We can &apos;t make the grape plant produce babies .
Nature has put a set of rules out there .
If we could , would we ?
Thank you .
Chris Downey : Design with the blind in mind
Things were going pretty well .
As I did , so slid the chair .
Now I was getting a little anxious .
Now , I was officially freaking out .
Who knows , maybe she was volunteering for service .
The surgery was successful .
Two days later , my sight started to fail .
On the third day , it was gone .
He was 36 . I was seven at the time .
My son still had his dad .
Within six months , I had returned to work .
My training had started .
It was a lot of hard work .
That was a little curious to me .
But also , the sense of smell .
A lot of the information is good .
You &apos;ve got to figure out what they actually meant .
Some of it &apos;s kind of wrong and not helpful .
But it &apos;s all good in the grand scheme of things .
What could I do ?
&quot; Would you like some help ? &quot;
I liked it sighted . It was fine .
It &apos;s a perfectly great city .
&quot; Bless you , man . &quot;
&quot; Go for it , brother . &quot;
&quot; God bless you . &quot;
I didn &apos;t get that sighted .
Disability is an equal-opportunity provider .
Everybody &apos;s welcome .
It &apos;s too late then .
The space between buildings will be well-balanced between people and cars .
In fact , cars , who needs them ?
If you &apos;re blind , you don &apos;t drive .
They don &apos;t like it when you drive .
Blind people want to work too .
They want to earn a living .
So thank you .
Geoffrey Canada : Our failing schools . Enough is enough !
But I am angry .
You saw the quality of the educators who were here .
It is absolutely possible .
Why haven &apos;t we fixed this ?
And you know something about a lousy school ?
It &apos;s not like a bottle of wine .
Right ?
Why haven &apos;t we allowed innovation to happen ?
Do not tell me we can &apos;t do better than this .
What kind of business model is that ?
Banks used to open and operate between 10 and 3 .
Who created that business model ? Right ?
And it went on for decades .
You know why ? Because they didn &apos;t care .
It wasn &apos;t about the customers .
They all operate the same way . Right ?
Now , one day , some crazy banker had an idea .
They might like that . What about a Saturday ?
What about introducing technology ?
I am never using that , right ? &quot;
So technology has changed . Things have changed .
Yet not in education . Why ?
They will say the worst things about you .
You look at them in September , they &apos;ve gone down .
Because it suggests we should do something .
Every 10 years they reproduce the same study .
The system decides you can &apos;t run schools in the summer .
I thought I knew something .
You plant them in the spring .
So who came up with this idea ? Who owns it ?
Why did we ever do it ?
They didn &apos;t have any place for their kids to go .
It was a perfect place to have schools .
So why don &apos;t we ? Why don &apos;t we ?
Because our business has refused to use science .
How many places in America are going to change ? None .
Here &apos;s what we know .
We know that the problem begins immediately .
Right ? This idea , zero to three .
That &apos;s a longer story .
We didn &apos;t know how critical those first three years were .
We didn &apos;t know what was happening in those young brains .
Wealthy people know . Educated people know .
And their kids have an advantage .
But we know this is critical .
Now , you take pre-kindergarten .
We know it &apos;s important for kids .
Poor kids need that experience .
Nope . Lots of places , it doesn &apos;t exist .
We know health services matter .
I used to make stuff up . Right ?
And I had to because I had to raise the money .
Because I actually like kids .
I actually like kids .
So here &apos;s the other thing .
But here &apos;s the problem with testing .
You know when we &apos;re going to get the results back ?
Maybe July , maybe June .
And the results have great data .
And so , what do you do ?
You go on vacation .
You come back from vacation .
You don &apos;t look at it .
Why would you look at it ?
You &apos;re going to go and teach this year .
I need that data in September .
I need that data in November .
I need to know that this week .
I can predict school scores .
You take me to any school .
I &apos;m really good at inner city schools that are struggling .
You say , &quot; We &apos;re doing the same thing . &quot;
I &apos;m going to make a prediction .
And I will be right every single time .
We can &apos;t stifle innovation in our business .
They get angry if you do something different .
This stuff hasn &apos;t worked for 55 years .
Let &apos;s try something different . And here &apos;s the rub .
Some of it &apos;s not going to work .
A lot of them don &apos;t . They should be closed .
I mean , I really believe they should be closed .
Right ? Because that &apos;s not the way the world works .
That thing lasted all of three weeks . It was over .
I was so disgusted I spent my money on this thing .
The folks went out there . They kept inventing .
We &apos;ve got to give them all of these opportunities .
America cannot wait another 50 years to get this right .
We have run out of time .
What is five billion dollars to the United States ?
What did we spend in Afghanistan this year ?
How many trillions ?
So , you guys , help me get there .
Thank you all very much . Thank you .
A hundred percent of them went to college .
This year &apos;s seniors will have 100 percent graduating high school .
Last I heard we had 93 percent accepted to college .
We &apos;d better get that other seven percent .
So that &apos;s just how this goes .
What are you talking about that you want to leave school ?
And you &apos;re not coming back here . &quot;
JL : Well , thank you Dr. Canada .
Please give it up for him one more time .
Sanjay Dastoor : A skateboard , with a boost
So we built something .
I &apos;ve got some of the pieces in my pocket here .
So this is the motor .
These are from remote control airplanes .
It &apos;s incredible just how light this thing is .
Thank you .
Bunker Roy : Learning from a barefoot movement
I &apos;d like to take you to another world .
The whole world was laid out for me .
Everything was at my feet .
I could do nothing wrong .
It changed my life .
Mother went into a coma .
&quot; What is this ?
I mean , is there something wrong with you ? &quot;
It made me think .
&quot; What do you want to do in a village ?
&quot; Dig wells for five years ?
I went to this village for the first time .
I said , &quot; No . &quot;
&quot; You failed in your exam ? &quot;
I said , &quot; No . &quot;
&quot; What are you doing here ?
Why are you here ?
So the elders gave me some very sound and profound advice .
You have to work with your hands .
You have to have a dignity of labor .
So we started the Barefoot College , and we redefined professionalism .
Who is a professional ?
A water diviner is a professional .
A traditional midwife is a professional .
A traditional bone setter is a professional .
These are professionals all over the world .
You find them in any inaccessible village around the world .
There are no contracts , no written contracts .
You can stay with me for 20 years , go tomorrow .
And no one can get more than $ 100 a month .
That is where we want you to try crazy ideas .
Whatever idea you have , come and try it .
It doesn &apos;t matter if you fail .
Battered , bruised , you start again .
You are certified by the community you serve .
So we built the first Barefoot College in 1986 .
150 people lived there , worked there .
They got the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2002 .
Not even worth it .
No water , rocky soil . &quot;
I was in a bit of a spot .
This is what it looks like today .
This is waterproofing the roof . &quot;
But it actually doesn &apos;t leak .
Since 1986 , it hasn &apos;t leaked .
This technology , the women will not share with the men .
It &apos;s the only college which is fully solar-electrified .
All the power comes from the sun .
45 kilowatts of panels on the roof .
And everything works off the sun for the next 25 years .
It &apos;s a parabolic Scheffler solar cooker .
You &apos;ll never find Indian women so precise .
Absolutely to the last inch , they can make that cooker .
And we have 60 meals twice a day of solar cooking .
She actually looks after the teeth of 7,000 children .
Very little water is wasted .
And what do we teach in these schools ?
This is what we teach in the night schools .
But all the schools are solar-lit .
Every five years we have an election .
The prime minister is 12 years old .
And they actually monitor and supervise 150 schools for 7,000 children .
First time ever going out of her village .
Never seen Sweden .
Wasn &apos;t dazzled at all by what was happening .
Puppets is the way we communicate .
You have Jokhim Chacha who is 300 years old .
He is my psychoanalyst . He is my teacher .
He &apos;s my doctor . He &apos;s my lawyer .
He &apos;s my donor .
He actually raises money , solves my disputes .
He solves my problems in the village .
The attendance must not drop . &quot;
These puppets are made out of recycled World Bank reports .
Went to Afghanistan .
One lesson we learned in India was men are untrainable .
So we came up with a great solution : train grandmothers .
What &apos;s the best way of communicating in the world today ?
Television ? No .
Telegraph ? No .
Telephone ? No .
Tell a woman .
So I took the husbands along .
In six months , how do we train these women ?
Sign language .
You don &apos;t choose the written word .
You don &apos;t choose the spoken word .
You use sign language .
And in six months they can become solar engineers .
They go back and solar-electrify their own village .
This woman is an extraordinary grandmother .
And they haven &apos;t collapsed .
He didn &apos;t know .
We went to Africa , and we did the same thing .
But their body language is great .
They &apos;re speaking to each other and actually becoming solar engineers .
Went straight to the president .
&quot; What &apos;s the story . &quot;
I said , &quot; I can &apos;t , Mr. President .
But they will . The grandmothers will . &quot;
And 150 grandmothers have been trained in Sierra Leone .
Gambia : we went to select a grandmother in Gambia .
Went to this village .
I knew which woman I would like to take .
&quot; Difficult husband ; not possible . &quot;
I said , &quot; Yeah , she is very beautiful . &quot;
That was his biggest fear .
She went like a grandmother and came back like a tiger .
She handled the national press , and she was a star .
&quot; Oh , somewhere . It doesn &apos;t matter . &quot;
Success story .
Look for solutions within .
They &apos;re all over the world .
Don &apos;t even worry .
They have all the solutions in the world .
I &apos;ll end with a quotation by Mahatma Gandhi .
Thank you .
Peter Haas : Haiti &apos;s disaster of engineering
I learned about the Haiti earthquake by Skype .
The general hospital right next door emerged largely unscathed .
This is the Ministry of Economics and Finance .
We haven &apos;t heard about why the buildings failed .
We inspected schools and private residencies .
We inspected medical centers and food warehouses .
We inspected government buildings .
This is the Ministry of Justice .
Behind that door is the National Judicial Archives .
There is nothing here that we don &apos;t know .
Now there &apos;s a solution to all these problems .
And we know how to build properly .
What was the difference between Chile and Haiti ?
Chileans have been building with confined masonry for decades .
And they redid that building .
And every building that they build going forward will be safe .
Now there are many groups doing this .
Marcus Byrne : The dance of the dung beetle
So the question is , where do we start this story ?
They are grown completely in a ball of dung .
So , according to dung beetles , dung is pretty good .
Its head is down . It &apos;s walking backwards .
This is Africa . It &apos;s hot .
And the obvious thing to look at is the sun .
And look at what the beetle does .
So obviously beetles can see polarized light .
How are they maintaining it in a particular straight line ?
But how do they pick up those celestial cues ?
That was what was of interest to us next .
So what are they doing when they do this dance ?
How far can we push them before they will reorientate themselves ?
And see what his response is .
And you see him do it again .
Now we thought , now what could be going on here ?
And we thought that it could be a thermoregulatory behavior .
So what we did was design a couple of arenas .
one was hot , one was cold .
We shaded this one . We left that one hot .
So the background here is around about 50 degrees centigrade .
It &apos;s about the same as yours and mine .
It &apos;s up around 55 to 60 degrees centigrade .
Watch how often the beetle dances .
And look at its front legs . They &apos;re roaringly hot .
So we described these as cool boots .
And that &apos;s exactly what the beetles are doing here .
It &apos;s from a genus called Pachysoma .
This is a dung beetle . Watch what he &apos;s doing .
Can you spot the difference ?
And his neighbor steals one of his dung pellets .
If it &apos;s using landmarks , it will find its home .
So here &apos;s our cunning experimenter .
The forage has been displaced to a new position .
So there he is there .
He &apos;s about to head home , and look what happens .
Shame .
It hasn &apos;t a clue .
We don &apos;t know yet what dung beetles use .
Thank you .
Ron Gutman : The hidden power of smiling
I wanted to save the world and then make everyone happy .
In another yearbook , I stumbled upon Barry Obama &apos;s picture .
But now I know it was all in his smile .
The good news is that we &apos;re actually born smiling .
Raise your hand if you do . Oh , wow .
You ask , why ?
Please , don &apos;t try this at home .
That &apos;s like 25 grand a smile .
It &apos;s not bad .
Peter Singer : The why and how of effective altruism
There &apos;s something that I &apos;d like you to see .
The entire accident is caught on camera .
Within two minutes , three people pass two-year-old Wang Yue by .
The first walks around the badly injured toddler completely .
Others look at her before moving off .
I would have stopped to help . &quot;
Raise your hands if that thought occurred to you .
As I thought , that &apos;s most of you .
And I believe you . I &apos;m sure you &apos;re right .
But still , 6.9 million is 19,000 children dying every day .
Does it really matter that they &apos;re far away ?
I don &apos;t think it does make a morally relevant difference .
And the answer is , yes we can .
The heart , of course , you felt .
You felt the empathy for that child .
It does help us to put perspective on our situation .
But if I &apos;m not , what can I do ?
They worry how much of a difference they can make .
But you don &apos;t have to be a billionaire .
Toby himself does better than that .
Here &apos;s one young man who &apos;s taken this advice .
His name is Matt Weiger .
But he &apos;s gone into finance in New York .
So let &apos;s talk about effectiveness .
That &apos;s a good thing to do , right ?
There &apos;s many possibilities .
I don &apos;t really believe it is .
It &apos;s been something fulfilling to me .
Charlie Bresler said to me that he &apos;s not an altruist .
He thinks that the life he &apos;s saving is his own .
You never get off , and you never really feel satisfied .
Becoming an effective altruist gives you that meaning and fulfillment .
This is a picture of him showing him recovering from surgery .
Why was he recovering from surgery ?
There &apos;s about 100 people each year in the U.S.
and more in other countries who do that .
Thank you .
Amy Smith : Simple designs to save a life
I find this shocking and somewhat appalling .
Can &apos;t we make cleaner burning cooking fuels ?
Can &apos;t we make better stoves ?
You &apos;ll see scenes like this all over the island .
It &apos;s not that people are ignorant to the environmental damage .
They know perfectly well , but they have no other choice .
And so this is what they do .
But this device was very slow .
So you could imagine they were very excited about it .
So it was a little discouraging to the students .
So we did this . We went down to Haiti .
And these are the briquettes that we made .
And so we were very happy , thus far .
So what is this ? This is corncobs turned into charcoal .
And actually , like Nick , I brought samples .
So we can pass these around .
They &apos;re fully functional , field-tested , ready to roll out .
People can make their own cooking fuel from waste products .
They can generate income from this .
These are the solutions that we need to find .
We shouldn &apos;t be doing it from outside .
Thank you .
We &apos;re also looking at low-cost water treatment systems .
What &apos;s the bottleneck to preventing this stuff getting from scale ?
And we &apos;re a pretty small staff , which is me .
Paula Johnson : His and hers … healthcare
Her apartment was an oasis .
She loved life .
She no longer worked or traveled .
She no longer danced .
There were no more coffee times .
Her care became all-consuming for our family .
Now many of you will recognize her symptoms .
My grandmother had depression .
A deep , life-altering depression , from which she never recovered .
And back then , so little was known about depression .
And these symptoms are often overlooked as symptoms of depression .
Today , we know that every cell has a sex .
It means that we &apos;re different across all of our organs .
And in many ways , the law has worked .
And we &apos;re leaving it to chance in two ways .
We are just not doing enough .
Let &apos;s start with heart disease .
This is the face of heart disease .
When she had recurring symptoms she went back to her doctor .
Her doctor did the gold standard test : a cardiac catheterization .
It showed no blockages .
Linda &apos;s symptoms continued .
She had to stop working .
And that &apos;s when she found us .
But we needed another test to make the diagnosis .
The typical male disease looks like this .
There &apos;s a discrete blockage or stenosis .
Now , Linda received the right treatment .
But Linda was lucky .
She found us , we found her disease .
But for too many women , that &apos;s not the case .
We have the tools .
We have the technology to make the diagnosis .
So what about treatment ?
What a lost opportunity .
All three women have something very important in common .
All three were nonsmokers .
Sadly , Dana and Hung Wei died of their disease .
Now , here are some clues .
And these genes are activated mainly by estrogen .
This led them to ask the question : Well , why ?
So let &apos;s go back to depression .
You can actually see the difference .
We know that every cell has a sex .
We know that these differences are often overlooked .
Or if we analyzed our data by sex .
So , people often ask me : What can I do ?
That &apos;s her legacy .
Thank you .
Basking sharks are awesome creatures . They are just magnificent .
They grow 10 meters long .
Some say bigger .
They might weigh up to two tons .
Some say up to five tons .
They &apos;re the second largest fish in the world .
They &apos;re also harmless plankton-feeding animals .
They &apos;re fantastic creatures .
This is an old woodcut from the 17 , 1800s .
You get gallons of oil from their liver .
So they were incredibly important animals .
This is Keem Bay up in Achill Island .
And sharks used to come into the bay .
It would often drown and suffocate .
Maybe five or six people get killed by sharks every year .
We kill about 100 million sharks a year .
&quot; Liabhan mor , &quot; suggesting a big animal .
And that &apos;s a lovely , evocative name .
Hope there &apos;s no one from Tory here ; lovely place .
Some people say it &apos;s not population decline .
It might be a change in the distribution of plankton .
They &apos;re now listed as vulnerable under the IUCN .
They &apos;re not protected in Ireland .
We know very little about them .
This is a beachcaster rod with a tag on the end .
Go up in your boat and tag the shark .
And we were very effective .
We tagged 105 sharks last summer .
We got 50 in three days off Inishowen Peninsula .
But it &apos;s a very simple and easy technique .
I &apos;ll show you what they look like .
These are archival tags .
So what they do is they store the data .
And you have to kind of reconstruct the path .
And here &apos;s a couple of maps that we &apos;ve done .
Christmas day it was out on the shelf edge .
And that &apos;s why it &apos;s great to have collaboration .
So we can work with geneticists who understand that .
And you see that this work was done in 2006 .
We had no idea , did they distinguish into different populations ?
Were there subpopulations ?
So it doesn &apos;t really make sense at all .
They all basically seem the same .
That &apos;s it .
8,000 animals in the world .
And using different microsatellites gave the different results .
There &apos;s only 8,000 basking shark females in the world ?
I don &apos;t know . I don &apos;t believe it .
The problem with this is they were constrained with samples .
So where do you get samples from for your genetic analysis ?
Another source would be fisheries bycatch .
We were getting quite a few caught in surface drift nets .
And some are caught in nets , in trawls .
And they actually did get a fine for that .
And that was fine . We got wet . No problem .
So I was thinking that must have come from the shark .
So I tried that , I tried many techniques .
So that wasn &apos;t going to work .
So I scraped it off .
And I said , &quot; You might try that . &quot;
And they sat on it for months actually .
And so he was all very excited .
It became known as Simon &apos;s shark slime .
And you rarely see them .
So we were desperate .
And here it is .
Look at that lovely , black shark slime .
And I was thinking of humpback whales breaching and dolphins .
So you can quite easily tell the gender of the shark .
And they are caught and they are on the market .
You want to learn as much as you can .
I &apos;ll take that as my scientific legacy .
But for the time being , thank you for that .
And keep an eye out for sharks .
So thank you and thank you for listening .
But we at Harvard were wondering if this was really true .
And we cogitated about this for about four years .
And we came to a startling conclusion .
Jean-Baptiste Michel : So how did we get to this conclusion ?
So many books actually have been written over the years .
This is very , very low .
This is extremely practical , but not so awesome .
They have digitized millions of books .
That &apos;s very practical and extremely awesome .
Since time immemorial , there have been authors .
These authors have been striving to write books .
Now we &apos;ve got the data , plus we have metadata .
Of course what we did when faced with such outrageous hyperbole ...
was what any self-respecting researchers would have done .
We &apos;re going to try science . &quot;
Now we &apos;re thinking , what data can we release ?
So take for instance &quot; A gleam of happiness . &quot;
It &apos;s four words ; we call that a four-gram .
What do they tell us ?
Well the individual n-grams measure cultural trends .
Let me give you an example .
Well which one should I use ?
How to know ?
What should I do ? &quot;
Two rows from this table of two billion entries .
Now this is just two out of two billion rows .
For instance , this one .
Through the 30s and 40s , no one cared .
But nothing got people interested in 1950 like the year 1950 .
People were walking around obsessed .
And just like that , the bubble burst .
And it turns out that we can measure that very precisely .
We are losing interest in the past more rapidly .
JM : Now a little piece of career advice .
One mistake you should not do is become a mathematician .
But guess what , nobody will really care .
EL There are more sobering notes among the n-grams .
And this looks like the normal trajectory of a famous person .
We can actually figure it out using really basic signal processing .
Here &apos;s a simple way to do it .
So that &apos;s sort of what we expect .
And we compare that to the fame that we observe .
What you expect is basically what you observe .
People talked about it twice less as it should have been .
But much more importantly , the distribution is much wider .
This picture is the hallmark of censorship in the book record .
EL So culturomics is what we call this method .
It &apos;s kind of like genomics .
Culturomics is similar .
The great thing about culturomics is that everyone can do it .
Why can everyone do it ?
We have to make this available for people . &quot;
This person was interested in the history of frustration .
There &apos;s various types of frustration .
We think that might have something to do with Reagan .
Google has started to digitize 15 million books .
It &apos;s a sizable chunk of human culture .
Thank you very much .
Peter Eigen : How to expose the corrupt
Let me talk about my own experience .
You are meddling in the internal affairs of our partner countries .
Now , these suppliers were our big companies .
In Germany , foreign bribery was allowed .
It was even tax-deductible .
Not all of them , but most of them .
Many of them didn &apos;t want to bribe .
We had this small NGO , Transparency International .
This is what these other cultures demand .
They even applaud it .
In fact , &#91; unclear &#93; still says this today .
Cabinet ministers would admit this .
We had a longer-term time perspective .
And that &apos;s why the law has changed .
This case , they are not prosecuting in the UK .
We are , Germany , is not ratifying .
I see my time is ticking .
By now , the United Nations is totally on our side .
Not all civil society organizations are good .
The Ku Klux Klan is an NGO .
They have to have a much more transparent financial governance .
We also need much more competence of civil society leaders .
Thank you .
Willie Smits : How to restore a rainforest
There was a very sick orangutan baby , my first encounter .
Of course , the cage was salvaged .
This is Uce .
No . No . No . Wrong .
It &apos;s not good .
And these are horrible images .
And I don &apos;t know anymore where to put them .
No . Everyone should be able to follow this .
As you can see there &apos;s only yellow terrain .
There &apos;s nothing left -- just a bit of grass there .
There was a huge amount of crime .
There was no agricultural productivity left .
This was like a biological desert .
We have 30 species of reptiles .
But we saw the same thing .
There are no trees left .
So how &apos;s this possible ?
The people would become the defenders of that forest .
Now in this recipe you also have the cost .
You also know how much labor is needed .
It exudes &#91; unclear &#93; -like compounds from the roots .
So beautiful . What a theory .
But is it really that easy ?
This is an area of about 50 million hectares .
January .
February .
March .
April .
May .
So how to break that cycle ?
Fire is the biggest problem .
This is what it looked like for three months .
So these fires are really the first things to work on .
So you have to do it with the local people .
In principle , you make those trees into biological photovoltaic cells .
And this forest is quite different .
And they become like nutrient pumps .
And then we started planting -- only 1,000 trees a day .
And we do a lot of work here .
It &apos;s only a small part of the area .
The nursery , in here , is quite different .
165 .
Can you imagine ?
So this is after one year .
And this is after two years .
So we lowered air temperature three to five degrees Celsius .
Air humidity is up 10 percent .
Rainfall is up .
And all these species and income .
We actually have it already with Google Earth .
So this is the Samboja Lestari area .
And look at these images .
I &apos;ll just run them very quickly through .
So you can actually change the climate .
We have our farmer schools .
This is how it looks .
All the seeds get eaten .
They have enough income for three families .
There is no simple one recipe for one place .
Ken Robinson : How schools kill creativity
I &apos;ve been blown away by the whole thing .
In fact , I &apos;m leaving .
Don &apos;t you ? I find this very interesting .
You &apos;re not asked .
Like religion , and money and other things .
And we squander them , pretty ruthlessly .
Thank you . That was it , by the way .
Thank you very much . So , 15 minutes left .
Well , I was born ... no .
He was in the Nativity play .
Do you remember the story ? No , it was big .
It was a big story . Mel Gibson did the sequel .
We considered this to be one of the lead parts .
They just switched , that was it .
And the third boy said , &quot; Frank sent this . &quot;
If they don &apos;t know , they &apos;ll have a go .
Am I right ? They &apos;re not frightened of being wrong .
They have become frightened of being wrong .
And we run our companies like this , by the way .
So why is this ?
I lived in Stratford-on-Avon until about five years ago .
In fact , we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles .
So you can imagine what a seamless transition that was .
And stop speaking like that . It &apos;s confusing everybody . &quot;
My son didn &apos;t want to come .
He &apos;d known her for a month .
Every one . Doesn &apos;t matter where you go .
Everywhere on Earth .
Why not ? I think this is rather important .
I think math is very important , but so is dance .
And slightly to one side .
They &apos;re the people who come out the top .
And I used to be one , so there .
They live up there , and slightly to one side .
It &apos;s a way of getting their head to meetings .
And there &apos;s a reason .
They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism .
So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas .
And I didn &apos;t want one , frankly .
It &apos;s a process of academic inflation .
We know three things about intelligence .
We think in abstract terms , we think in movement .
Secondly , intelligence is dynamic .
The brain isn &apos;t divided into compartments .
Because you are , aren &apos;t you ?
It wasn &apos;t an available condition .
People weren &apos;t aware they could have that .
Take her to a dance school . &quot;
I said , &quot; What happened ? &quot;
And for the future , it won &apos;t serve us .
And he &apos;s right .
What TED celebrates is the gift of the human imagination .
The hidden beauty of pollination
It &apos;s great being here at TED .
It fills me with wonder , and it opens my heart .
Their relationship is a love story that feeds the Earth .
It &apos;s like the canary in the coalmine .
If they disappear , so do we .
I go , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Well , in order to reproduce . &quot;
&quot; Well , why ? &quot;
Everything in the universe wears out . &quot;
And that blew my mind .
So here is some nectar from my film .
Here are some images from the film .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
You &apos;re also talking about baseball .
A glove or a catcher &apos;s mitt is a condom .
This baseball model is incredibly problematic .
It &apos;s sexist . It &apos;s heterosexist .
It &apos;s competitive . It &apos;s goal-directed .
So we need a new model .
I &apos;m here today to offer you that new model .
And it &apos;s based on pizza .
So let &apos;s do this .
So when do you play baseball ?
It &apos;s not exactly your choice .
That &apos;s just not the way it happens .
That &apos;s usually a sign to the boy .
Somebody &apos;s trying to defend people moving into the field .
That &apos;s often given to the girl .
It &apos;s competitive .
We &apos;re not playing with each other .
We &apos;re playing against each other .
Everybody knows the rules .
You just take your position and play the game .
But when do you have pizza ?
Well , you have pizza when you &apos;re hungry for pizza .
&quot; Huh . I could go for some pizza . &quot;
You talk about it .
You talk about what you want .
You talk about what you like .
You may even negotiate it .
&quot; How do you feel about pepperoni ? &quot;
&quot; Well , maybe we can go half and half . &quot;
&quot; Or maybe something a little more adventurous ? &quot;
You can &apos;t hit the ball and run to right field .
That doesn &apos;t work .
No .
Not everybody can play baseball . It &apos;s pretty exclusive .
Okay , but what about pizza ?
There are a million different kinds of pizza .
There &apos;s a million different toppings .
There &apos;s a million different ways to eat pizza .
And none of them are wrong . They &apos;re different .
And lastly , what &apos;s the expected outcome of baseball ?
Well , in baseball , you play to win .
You score as many runs as you can .
But what about pizza ?
And we get to decide when we feel satisfied .
If we &apos;re still hungry , we might have some more .
And those young people become older people .
They &apos;re all exclamation points .
But under the pizza model , they &apos;re questions .
And who gets to answer those questions ?
You do . I do .
Thank you very much for your time .
Auret van Heerden : Making global labor fair
One man died after working a 36-hour shift .
We all love chocolate .
We buy it for our kids .
This is a mine in Zimbabwe right now .
It &apos;s forced child labor on an institutional scale .
These places , these origins , represent governance gaps .
That &apos;s the politest description I have for them .
Some of these governance gaps are run by rogue states .
Some of them are not states anymore at all .
They &apos;re failed states .
We need a reality check .
This is an independent republic , probably a failed state .
It &apos;s definitely not a democratic state .
Now , that &apos;s not a new story .
But take the example of heparin .
It &apos;s a pharmaceutical product .
A no-brainer .
The problem was that it killed more people .
And the USFDA has a jurisdictional problem .
This is offshore .
And you can just look at the headlines .
Their voters are local .
They have parochial interests .
We need a different machine .
Fortunately , we have some examples .
Companies didn &apos;t feel it was their responsibility .
They don &apos;t own those facilities .
They don &apos;t employ those workers .
They &apos;re not legally liable .
We &apos;ll make it part of the contract . &quot;
Those factories will probably never see an inspector .
That makes a difference .
But they are extremely efficient organizations .
Now , getting there is not easy .
You need a safe space .
We can do it . The technical solutions are there .
It &apos;s crazy .
Multinationals are protecting human rights .
I know there &apos;s going to be disbelief .
You &apos;ll say , &quot; How can we trust them ? &quot;
Well , we don &apos;t .
So we audit .
Transparency is absolutely critical to this .
Go to the website . Look at the audit results .
Can I buy that product without compromising my ethics ?
That &apos;s the way the system works .
So we started out thinking this was a stopgap measure .
Call it network governance . Call it what you will .
Look at the health systems in so many countries .
No .
Absolutely .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to provide .
There are thousands of suppliers in there . &quot;
But there are companies .
We have 4,000 companies who are members .
Some of them are very , very large companies .
The example , the role model , is there .
It seems overwhelming .
The numbers just make you want to zone out .
But we break it down to some basic realities .
It starts with just giving people back their dignity .
They didn &apos;t say money .
Please ask them to treat us like human beings . &quot;
That &apos;s my simple understanding of human rights .
So I appeal to you .
Thank you very much .
Ben Saunders : Why did I ski to the North Pole ?
This is me . My name is Ben Saunders .
I specialize in dragging heavy things around cold places .
More than 2,000 people have climbed Everest .
12 people have stood on the moon .
It all started back in 2001 .
This was like my polar apprenticeship .
I &apos;d spoken to all the experts .
We were attacked by a polar bear on day two .
I had frostbite in my left big toe .
Some very unusual weather conditions , very difficult ice conditions .
We had decidedly low-tech communications .
There &apos;s a wire dangling down either side .
That was our HF radio antenna .
Ultimately , we ran out of time .
We &apos;ve got to pick you up . &quot;
And I felt that I had failed , wholeheartedly .
I was a failure .
The first one was reaching the Pole itself .
And of course , neither of these things happened .
The lesson is : don &apos;t even try . &quot;
He described this expedition as 10 times as dangerous as Everest .
And the expedition started in February last year .
We got to Khatanga .
I was , you can see there , pulling two sledges .
My record was minus 2.5 miles .
: So it &apos;s day 22 .
I &apos;m lying in the tent , getting ready to go .
It was a lack of ice -- open water .
This was my little bit of bio-mimicry .
Polar bears on the Artic Ocean move in dead straight lines .
Another exciting thing we did last year was with communications technology .
I &apos;d navigate using the direction of the wind .
So , kind of a weird combination of high-tech and low-tech .
I got to the Pole on the 11th of May .
I knew this , but I was expecting something .
Took a few photos . I got my satellite phone out .
I warmed the battery up in my armpit .
I dialed three numbers . I dialed my mum .
And I got three voicemails .
: Ninety .
It &apos;s a special feeling .
The entire planet is rotating beneath my feet .
The -- the whole world underneath me .
She started crying . She asked me to call her back .
I skied on for a week past the Pole .
This was the last day I had on the ice .
We &apos;d like to pick you up .
Ben , could you please look for an airstrip ? &quot;
I thought , it &apos;ll have to do .
I &apos;m supposed to be the roughty toughty explorer type .
The plane taxied up to where I was standing .
The co-pilot was a lady called Monica .
She sat there in a sort of hand-knitted jumper .
He put his hand on the throttle .
And only from the air did I see the big picture .
I mean , it really was starting to break up .
Why ? I &apos;m not an explorer in the traditional sense .
There &apos;s a cafe and there &apos;s a tourist shop .
And it &apos;s also about potential , on a personal level .
What &apos;s next : Antarctica .
There was a tent , a letter to the Norwegian king .
Two of us are doing it .
That &apos;s pretty much it .
Ladies and gentlemen , that &apos;s my story .
Thank you very much .
William Kamkwamba : How I harnessed the wind
Thank you .
I spoke very briefly about one of my proudest creations .
It was a simple machine that changed my life .
I had never used a computer .
I had never seen an Internet .
On the stage that day , I was so nervous .
My English lost , I wanted to vomit .
There was a story I wouldn &apos;t tell you then .
But well , I &apos;m feeling good right now .
I would like to share that story today .
We have seven children in my family .
All sisters , excepting me .
Like everyone else , we grew maize .
One year our fortune turned very bad .
In 2001 we experienced an awful famine .
Within five months all Malawians began to starve to death .
My family ate one meal per day , at night .
Only three swallows of nsima for each one of us .
The food passes through our bodies .
We drop down to nothing .
I looked at my father and looked at those dry fields .
It was the future I couldn &apos;t accept .
So I went to a library .
I read books , science books , especially physics .
I couldn &apos;t read English that well .
I used diagrams and pictures to learn the words around them .
Another book put that knowledge in my hands .
It said a windmill could pump water and generate electricity .
So I decided I would build one windmill for myself .
Many people , including my mother , said I was crazy .
I found a tractor fan , shock absorber , PVC pipes .
It was one light at first .
Another machine pumps water for irrigation .
I could not get rid of them .
I had never seen an airplane before .
I had never slept in a hotel .
God bless .
Maybe one day you will watch this on the Internet .
I say to you , trust yourself and believe .
Whatever happens , don &apos;t give up .
Thank you .
Michael Shermer : The pattern behind self-deception
It &apos;s like a water dowsing device .
And you walk around , and it points to things .
Oh , sorry .
So what I want to talk about today is belief .
I want to believe , and you do too .
It is the default option . We just believe .
We believe all sorts of things .
It &apos;s more difficult .
It &apos;s uncomfortable to not believe things .
Essentially , we are pattern-seeking primates .
Our second type of error is a false negative .
So let &apos;s do a thought experiment .
Your name is Lucy , okay ?
And you hear a rustle in the grass .
But no harm . You just move away .
You &apos;re more cautious . You &apos;re more vigilant .
You &apos;ve just won a Darwin award .
You &apos;ve been taken out of the gene pool .
This is the only equation in the talk by the way .
And so I think that we evolved ...
So for example , what do you see here ?
It &apos;s a horse head , that &apos;s right .
It looks like a horse . It must be a horse .
That &apos;s a pattern .
And is it really a horse ?
Or is it more like a frog ?
For example , what do you see here ?
Yes , of course , it &apos;s a cow .
And what do you see here ?
Some people see a Dalmatian dog .
Yes , there it is . And there &apos;s the prime .
What do you see here ?
Planet Saturn . Yes , that &apos;s good .
How about here ?
Just shout out anything you see .
That &apos;s a good audience , Chris .
That is , almost everybody sees the planet Saturn .
Because fielders are successful 90 to 95 percent of the time .
The best batters fail seven out of 10 times .
Anybody see an object there ?
There actually is something here , but it &apos;s degraded .
Here is what you show subjects .
Brugger and his colleague , Christine Mohr , gave subjects L-DOPA .
L-DOPA increases dopamine .
So dopamine appears to be the drug associated with patternicity .
On the other hand , amphetamines like cocaine are dopamine agonists .
They increase the amount of dopamine .
So perhaps more dopamine is related to more creativity .
Dopamine , I think , changes our signal-to-noise ratio .
That is , how accurate we are in finding patterns .
Too high and maybe you see patterns everywhere .
You think people are talking about you .
The other one also , but maybe too many patterns .
And we then call that schizophrenia .
So the signal-to-noise ratio then presents us with a pattern-detection problem .
And what pattern do you see here ?
You know , of course , this is Via Uno shoes .
These are sandals .
Pretty sexy feet , I must say .
Maybe a little Photoshopped .
And you see the lamp here , I know .
Because the lights on here .
That &apos;s a dolphin tail there , guys .
The impossible crate illusion .
It &apos;s easy to fool the brain in 2D .
And so your brain is fooled .
Yet again , your pattern detection devices are fooled .
Here &apos;s some faces on the side of a rock .
But anyway , the point is still made .
Now which one of these looks odd to you ?
In a quick reaction , which one looks odd ?
And you are correct .
Now , they trade up the politicians every time .
Well , why is this happening ?
So you recognize Obama immediately .
Is it just the wind or a dangerous predator ?
What &apos;s the difference between those ?
And I call this process agenticity .
But this is a pattern detection problem , isn &apos;t it ?
Some patterns are real and some are not .
Was JFK assassinated by a conspiracy or by a lone assassin ?
My favorite one was he was in the manhole .
But of course , Lincoln was assassinated by a conspiracy .
So we can &apos;t just uniformly dismiss all patterns like that .
Because , let &apos;s face it , some patterns are real .
Some conspiracies really are true .
Explains a lot , maybe .
We did a whole issue on it .
They think it was an inside job by the Bush administration .
Well , that &apos;s a whole other lecture .
Because it worked .
So we are natural-born dualists .
Because we can imagine , in essence , continuing on .
You get a hypoxia , or a lower oxygen .
And the brain then senses that there &apos;s an out-of-body experience .
And you get a sense of out-of-body experience .
It &apos;s just a minute and a half .
Go ahead and roll it .
Would you have any problem kissing our models to test it ?
Girl : No .
You wouldn &apos;t ? You &apos;d think that was fine .
Girl : That would be fine .
So this is a blind test .
Kay , now can you see anything ?
Pull it so you can &apos;t even see down .
It &apos;s completely blind now , right ?
Girl : Yes .
Girl : Okay .
Girl : No .
Take a step here .
Okay .
And , Jennifer , how did that feel ?
Jennifer : Good .
Girl : Oh my God !
Clint Smith : How to raise a black son in America
Like , why did I really have to mow the lawn ?
Why was homework really that important ?
Why couldn &apos;t I put jelly beans in my oatmeal ?
My childhood was abound with questions like this .
You can &apos;t pretend to shoot guns .
You can &apos;t run around in the dark .
So that we could be kids , not casket or concrete .
But this cannot be what defines us .
Thank you .
Boniface Mwangi : The day I stood up alone
But that wasn &apos;t always me .
Growing up , I had a nickname .
Like every other human being , I avoided trouble .
In my childhood , they taught me silence .
Don &apos;t argue , do as you &apos;re told .
This was reinforced by the political climate of the time .
Kenya is a country where you are guilty until proven rich .
This was reinforced by the political climate of the day .
We had a president , Moi , who was a dictator .
Being a coward was not an insult .
Being a coward was a compliment .
My work was to document the violence .
I saw the killings . I saw the displacement .
We pretended . We all became smart cowards .
My friends did not show up .
What was making me feel this way ?
Most Kenyans did not see the violence .
It was a story to them .
We have even done symbolic burials .
So that was my story .
Do you know why you were born ?
Thank you .
It &apos;s an amazing story .
I just want to ask you a couple quick questions .
What &apos;s happening now with PAWA ?
Can I say one more thing ?
Thank you .
Traditional prescriptions for growth in Africa are not working very well .
Aid is not doing too well .
The newly prescribed silver bullet is microcredit .
My solution : Forget micro-entrepreneurs .
Consider these two alternative scenarios .
But why pan-African ?
Africa shall rise .
Thank you .
So Sangu , of course , this is strong rhetoric .
Do you think there is a role for microcredit at all ?
Sangu Delle : I think there is a role .
We need more than just microcredit .
We need more than just give 200 dollars .
We need to build big businesses , and we need jobs .
Very good . Thank you so much .
Khalida Brohi : How I work to protect women from honor killings
I was not going to cry myself to sleep .
In those days , I had discovered a website called Joogle .
It became enormous in just a few months .
I got a lot of support from all around the world .
Media was connecting to us .
We were challenging centuries-old customs in those communities .
Our car was stoned at one point .
I was devastated .
But we are working in the streets for you !
We are changing the policies .
How is that not impacting their life ?
Yes , apologize .
How do we do that ?
We are going to promote three of your main cultures .
We know that it &apos;s music , language , and embroidery .
Nobody believed us . Nobody wanted to work with us .
And so it began .
It was a beautiful day .
Through embroidery we were promoting their traditions .
We went into the village . We would mobilize the community .
We soon called this project Sughar .
It means skilled and confident women .
Thank you , thank you .
But that &apos;s actually not what I want .
Thank you so much .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
Khalida , you are quite the force of nature .
How does it scale ?
We have been experimenting with three ways only .
There are a hundred different ways to unleash potential in women .
I would just give the inspiration and that &apos;s my job .
I will keep doing it . Sughar will still be growing .
What did this team look like ?
This was school friends , right ?
Wait , wait , wait , not doing anything ?
KB : No . You &apos;re right .
KB : I live over there .
We live between , still , Karachi and Balochistan .
My siblings are all going to school .
I am still the oldest of eight siblings .
How do you handle safety ? Do you feel safe ?
Are there issues there ?
KB : Yeah .
Or they can get involved in the foundation .
Well , it &apos;s been incredible to have you here .
KB : Thank you so much . Thank you , Khalida .
I am multidisciplinary .
And recently , I &apos;ve actually been combining both .
This is the HI-SEAS program .
We did all kinds of research .
Busy , busy work .
But also we learned a lot .
I have no doubt about it .
So I came up with a new art project called Seeker .
That &apos;s the core of the project .
No , no .
It &apos;s a little bit like termites , really .
The first version was done in Belgium and Holland .
It was built with a team of almost 50 people .
And that &apos;s another crucial part of the project .
It &apos;s an evolving artwork , evolving architecture .
So there &apos;s always a strong ecological component in the project .
First of all , it &apos;s really considered a Mars analogue .
Thank you .
What &apos;s the fastest growing threat to Americans &apos; health ?
Cancer ? Heart attacks ? Diabetes ?
Could I please have my sock model on the stage ?
Great .
Thank you . Thank you , sock model .
So this is a drawing of my preliminary design .
Once pressure is applied , the connectivity between the particles increases .
Thank you very much .
Brian Dettmer : Old books reborn as art
I &apos;m an artist and I cut books .
This is one of my first book works .
It &apos;s called &quot; Alternate Route to Knowledge . &quot;
I &apos;m just carving around whatever I find interesting .
Or something like this can become a piece like this .
So books really are alive .
I think of the book as a tool .
And I also think of the book as a machine .
I also think of the book as a landscape .
sort of a flip flop .
And I think of my work as almost an archaeology .
Thank you .
And most people draw something like this .
The toast is then deposited for some time .
And then there are others that are about people .
It &apos;s about visualizing the experience that people have .
So it &apos;s crazy stuff .
Do you see it ? What &apos;s common about these ?
Most drawings have nodes and links .
So that &apos;s the value of these things .
So for example , Americans make toast with a toaster .
That seems obvious .
It &apos;s too complex .
So the sweet spot is between 5 and 13 .
So what happens then ?
It &apos;s the essence of the design process .
The drawings are much richer .
So what happens then ?
Well , here &apos;s what happens .
Really interesting -- talking gets in the way .
So here &apos;s some key lessons that can emerge from this .
So that &apos;s interesting .
And the practice is really pretty simple .
So , one example is from an organization called Rodale .
Big publishing company .
Why ? Because there &apos;s alignment from the executive team .
Make your ideas visible , tangible , and consequential .
Thank you .
Bassam Tariq : The beauty and diversity of Muslim life
Crowds of men with beards and skullcaps were swarming the streets .
What emerged was a beautiful and complicated portrait of America .
There &apos;s really nothing like it in America .
We must fight with an inventive approach .
Thank you .
Khadija Gbla : My mother &apos;s strange definition of empowerment
Hi .
I &apos;m not going to name the things your body does .
I was born in Sierra Leone .
Did anybody watch &quot; Blood Diamond &quot; ?
I don &apos;t have Ebola . You &apos;re all safe .
Don &apos;t rush to the door .
My grandfather had three wives .
Men , do you need more than one wife ?
I don &apos;t think so . There you go .
Oh yeah , he was .
Ebola is there as well . Stay away from it .
My mom applied for refugee status .
Australia said , we will take you in .
Good job , Aussies .
In this bush , we found two huts .
An old lady came towards us .
She was ethnic-looking , very old .
She had a chat with my mom , and went back .
We never talked about this again .
Yeah , that comforted us a bit .
It took us three days to get here .
We went to Senegal , then France , and then Singapore .
We went to the bathroom to wash our hands .
We spent 15 minutes opening the tap like this .
Like , seriously .
We were very grateful .
We settled and we liked it .
Then somebody took us to Rundle Mall .
Adelaide has only one mall .
It &apos;s this small place .
And we saw a lot of Asian people .
So fine , it &apos;s all good .
Let me say that . Chocolate color .
There were no Asians , no indigenous .
Type I is when they cut off the hood .
My eyes went onto Type II .
Before all of this , I pretty much had amnesia .
This had happened to everybody else .
I remembered what was done to me .
Oh my God .
And then the anger came .
I was a black angry woman . Oh yeah .
A little one , but angry nevertheless .
&quot; You did something to me . &quot;
She &apos;s used to me mouthing off .
You cut away something that belonged to me . &quot;
She said , &quot; Yes , I did .
I did it for your own good .
It was in your best interest .
It &apos;s made you a woman . &quot;
I &apos;m like , &quot; How ? &quot;
She said , &quot; You &apos;re empowered , Khadija .
Do you get itchy down there ? &quot;
Women who are not circumcised get itchy all the time .
Then they sleep around with everybody .
You are not going to sleep around with anybody . &quot;
I went back to school .
These were the days when we had Dolly and Girlfriend magazines .
The naughty bits , you know ?
This doesn &apos;t talk about people like me .
I don &apos;t have a clitoris .
I was like , these people and their damned clitoris .
That &apos;s what I want to know .
Didn &apos;t happen .
You have invaded me in the most sacred way .
I want pleasure .
I want to get horny , dammit , as well . &quot;
Are they your new friends , Khadija ? &quot;
She didn &apos;t get it .
We came from two different worlds .
It was celebrated .
I was an African Australian girl .
I lived in a society that was very clitoris-centric .
It was all about the damn clitoris !
And I didn &apos;t have one !
That pissed me off .
I feel incomplete .
Am I going to be asexual ? &quot;
It &apos;s so that we don &apos;t have any sexual desire .
And I said , &quot; Am I asexual now ?
She couldn &apos;t answer my questions , so they went unanswered .
Then they told me I had fibroids .
They &apos;re like these little balls sitting there .
One was covering one of my ovaries .
And there came then the big news .
And once again , I was an angry black woman .
What do you have to say for that ? &quot;
I &apos;m still waiting for an apology , by the way .
Then I got married .
You figure that out very soon .
Sex was very painful .
It hurt all the time .
I am the lucky girl .
It &apos;s that gift . It doesn &apos;t stop giving .
That &apos;s why it happened to me .
You heard me right .
Why No FGM Australia ?
FGM is in Australia .
And she said , &quot; Well , you married me . &quot;
This is an Australian problem , people .
FGM is child abuse .
It &apos;s violence against women .
It says we don &apos;t have a right to our bodies .
That &apos;s what I have to say to that .
What are you going to do ?
Culture should not be a defense for child abuse .
Make it personal .
It could be your daughter , your sister , your cousin .
I can &apos;t fight FGM alone .
I could try , but I can &apos;t .
So my appeal to you is , please join me .
So please join me in ending this act .
Thank you .
Morgana Bailey : The danger of hiding who you are
I didn &apos;t follow along with the crowd .
I wasn &apos;t afraid to try weird clothing trends or hairstyles .
I was outspoken and extremely social .
I became the opposite of who I thought I once was .
I stayed in my room instead of socializing .
I stopped engaging in clubs and leadership activities .
I didn &apos;t want to stand out in the crowd anymore .
I had always assumed I was immune to needing acceptance .
After all , I was a bit unconventional .
What have I been hiding for 16 years ?
I am a lesbian .
Thank you .
Just Morgana .
But I was paralyzed by my fear of not being accepted .
And I &apos;m not alone , of course .
Twelve years reduced life expectancy .
How does her father feel ?
And that shakes me to the core .
What if I had told her my story years ago ?
Could she have told her father my experience ?
Could I have ultimately helped change his vote ?
Their commitment to diversity is evident through their global inclusion programs .
But I didn &apos;t .
Instead of taking advantage of the opportunity , I did nothing .
&quot; There are more scary things inside than outside . &quot;
Thank you .
My students and I work on very tiny robots .
But what are the real challenges of engineering these ants ?
So I &apos;ll start with mobility .
Insects move around amazingly well .
This video is from UC Berkeley .
That &apos;s almost 100 times its own length .
So this leads to the robot that I showed you earlier .
But ultimately we want to add everything onboard the robot .
So this robot &apos;s about the size of a Tic Tac .
So the next video is one of my favorites .
It &apos;s only four by four by seven millimeters in size .
Right ? &quot; Fantastic Voyage , &quot; Isaac Asimov .
of what we can do with these small robots .
Thanks very much .
Navi Radjou : Creative problem-solving in the face of extreme limits
Take Mansukh Prajapati , a potter in India .
He can keep fruits and vegetables fresh for many days .
That &apos;s a cool invention , literally .
The Peruvians are amazing .
They can literally create water out of thin air .
Many of them did not go to school .
The street is the lab .
Why do they do that ?
In India , we call it Jugaad .
Second , we are running out of natural water and oil .
The good news is , that &apos;s starting to happen .
Let me give you two examples .
I guess you can call it a low-fat factory .
Actually , no .
Let me give you an example .
It &apos;s called gThrive .
It pays for itself within one year .
How do they do that ?
They charge a flat annual maintenance fee of just 20 Euros .
This is what I call low-cost banking without the bank .
The exciting news is that &apos;s starting to happen .
Let &apos;s go to Nairobi to find that out .
Nairobi has horrendous traffic jams .
and yet more effective .
The first principle is : Keep it simple .
Don &apos;t create solutions to impress customers .
Second principle : Do not reinvent the wheel .
Third principle is : Think and act horizontally .
The South pioneered frugal innovation out of sheer necessity .
Thank you very much .
Guatemala is recovering from a 36-year armed conflict .
A conflict that was fought during the Cold War .
We call them the Desaparecidos .
And only about 17 percent are of European descent .
Now the families , they want information .
They want to know what happened .
They want the bodies of their loved ones .
And we left .
We left Guatemala and we came here .
I didn &apos;t care for it ; it was too painful .
So I went back .
The way we work is that we give people information .
We talk to the family members and we let them choose .
A piece , an essence , of who they are .
We literally bring the skeleton out of the ground .
The other thing we want to understand is who they are .
Whether it &apos;s a baby , or an adult .
Whether it &apos;s a woman or a man .
The first is the case of the military diary .
And then you see a date .
Now that &apos;s going to come into play in a second .
Now Sergio was a professor at the university .
And he was captured on February 23 , 1984 .
And then we noticed that he was also in the diary .
Six .
That &apos;s right , six as well .
All put in that grave .
and go to countries like Haiti and the Congo .
It &apos;s very ironic .
People that 533 families are looking for .
So we &apos;re going to focus on Grave 15 .
Well , guess what ?
So we conducted some DNA analysis , and guess what ?
We identified Martina Rojas and Manuel Chen .
Now , Manuel Chen was three years old .
But we &apos;re doing more than that .
So no more missing , guys .
Okay ? No more missing .
Thank you .
Asha de Vos : Why you should care about whale poo
This is actually a disservice , because whales are ecosystem engineers .
Let &apos;s also do it for ours .
Thank you .
Erin McKean : Go ahead , make up new words !
I &apos;m a lexicographer .
I make dictionaries .
So they say something like , &quot; Because grammar ! &quot;
It &apos;s a wug .
Now there is another one .
There are two of these .
There are two ...
Audience : Wugs .
That rule lives in your brain .
So we &apos;ve been talking about this for a long time .
Nobody says this .
So you can think of a word as like a hat .
Who gets to wear a hat ?
What are the kinds of hats you get to wear ? &quot;
And I think that is , well , stupid .
But that makes no sense to me .
Words are great . We should have more of them .
I want you to make as many new words as possible .
The first way is the simplest way .
Basically , steal them from other languages .
This is called compounding .
Who here knew that &quot; motel &quot; was a blend word ?
You can also make words by changing how they operate .
This is called functional shift .
Almost any word in English can be verbed .
You can also take adjectives and make them into nouns .
And of course , you can &quot; green &quot; things .
Another way to make words in English is back-formation .
&quot; Edit &quot; was formed from &quot; editor . &quot;
So National Aeronautics and Space Administration becomes NASA .
And of course you can do this with anything , OMG !
So it doesn &apos;t matter how silly the words are .
They can be really good words of English .
&quot; Absquatulate &quot; is a perfectly good word of English .
&quot; Mugwump &quot; is a perfectly good word of English .
Why should you make words ?
And new words grab people &apos;s attention .
You can make a new word right now .
English has no age limit .
Thank you so much .
Mundano : Pimp my ... trash cart ?
Our world has many superheroes .
But they have the worst of all superpowers : invisibility .
And this is how I first met these marginalized superheroes .
But at this time , giving voice to the catadores .
Thank you .
So now everybody can join .
Muito orbigado , thank you .
Carol Dweck : The power of believing that you can improve
The power of yet .
It gives you a path into the future .
Some of them reacted in a shockingly positive way .
They understood that their abilities could be developed .
They had what I call a growth mindset .
But other students felt it was tragic , catastrophic .
So what do they do next ?
And in study after study , they have run from difficulty .
On the left , you see the fixed mindset students .
There &apos;s hardly any activity .
They run from the error .
They don &apos;t engage with it .
They engage deeply .
Their brain is on fire with yet .
They engage deeply .
They process the error .
They learn from it and they correct it .
How are we raising our children ?
Are we raising them for now instead of yet ?
Are we raising kids who are obsessed with getting A &apos;s ?
So what can we do ?
How can we build that bridge to yet ?
Here are some things we can do .
That has failed .
Don &apos;t do that anymore .
This process praise creates kids who are hardy and resilient .
There are other ways to reward yet .
And we can actually change students &apos; mindsets .
So let &apos;s talk about equality .
And here are just a few examples .
So the native kids outdid the Microsoft kids .
This happened because the meaning of effort and difficulty were transformed .
That &apos;s when they &apos;re getting smarter .
I received a letter recently from a 13-year-old boy .
I now realize I &apos;ve wasted most of my life . &quot;
Thank you .
Let &apos;s take a look at San Francisco .
You see something a little bit different happening in San Francisco .
And so it leads to things like this .
Let &apos;s take a look at Rio de Janeiro .
Even Justin Bieber fans are represented here .
How cool is that ?
And then the Flamengo football team is also represented here .
So we have all this data .
So what can we do with it ?
So what is a city ?
Thank you .
Location information can be very sensitive .
This information used to be private .
Did you know this was happening ?
Mike hasn &apos;t done anything wrong .
The question is , what should we do about this ?
I think this poses a serious civil liberties threat .
Fortunately , there are steps we can take .
Thank you .
.
Cảm ơn .
Thậm chí , cuộc bầu cử tuần rồi cũng trôi qua một cách lặng lẽ .
Al Jazeera . CNN . Chúng tôi làm điều đó như thế nào ?
Ý tưởng của anh đến từ đâu ?
Phòng ăn trưa .
Kể lại câu chuyện vào đúng thời điểm trong đêm .
Điều gì khác có thể diễn ra trong một thời gian thật dài ?
Vậy là một người trong chúng tôi nghĩ tới tàu hoả .
&quot; Ồ &quot; , chúng tôi nói &quot; toàn bộ hành trình &quot;
&quot; Ý chúng tôi là chương trình cơ &quot;
Rồi cứ thế , nói đi nói lại .
Một số đoạn phỏng vấn hành khách , một số đoạn đưa thông tin .
Thông báo : Đoàn tàu sắp vào Ga Haugastøl
Phong cảnh đồi núi cuối cùng trước khi đến đích hành trình .
Chúng ta đi qua Ga Mjølfjell .
Và lại một đường hầm mới .
Nó phù hợp với 2000 người sưu tập tàu hoả ở Na Uy .
Chúng tôi lên sóng vào tháng 11 năm 2009 .
Thế mà không , nó còn hấp dẫn hơn thế nữa .
Đó quả là một chương trình truyền hình sống động .
Chúng tôi muốn làm điều gì đó khác biệt .
Bergen Railway là một chương trình được ghi lại .
Liệu sẽ có nhiều người đến ?
Mọi chuyện sẽ như thế nào nhỉ ?
Rồi chúng tôi quyết định chương trình tiếp theo sẽ được phát trực tiếp .
Một kỷ niệm khó quên .
Nó thuộc về một anh chàng tên là Erik Hansen .
Họ đã tạo nên những câu chuyện .
Đây là Karl . Cậu bé học lớp chín .
Cậu lẽ ra phải đến trường lúc 8 giờ sáng .
Chúng tôi đã làm điều này như thế nào ?
Vâng , chúng tôi dùng một phòng họp trên chuyến tàu Hurtigruten .
Biến nó thành một phòng điều hành hoàn chỉnh .
Đây là một trong số đó .
những giải pháp thật sự sáng tạo .
Bình luận viên : Cho nó chạy lên chạy xuống .
Nó là cái máy khoan quan trọng nhất ở Na Uy .
8 dây cáp giữ cho máy quay ổn định .
Quay phim : Việc của tôi là tìm ra các giải pháp cho máy quay phim .
Chúng chỉ là các công cụ được dùng trong các hoàn cảnh khác nhau .
Anh ấy ổn . Mọi thứ đều tốt cả .
Đó là một thành công to lớn trên lĩnh vực truyền thông xã hội .
Xin cảm ơn .
Một vài người xem nhiều hơn một chút .
Ông cụ đã 82 tuổi và hầu như ngủ rất ít .
Dự án gần đây nhất , một chương trình camera giấu kín
Chúng tôi đã làm chương trình trực tiếp 18 tiếng về câu cá hồi .
Dự án tiếp theo của chúng tôi đã thu hút sự chú ý từ bên ngoài Na Uy .
Đây là từ Colbert Report trên kênh Comedy Central .
TH : Đúng vậy . Thế tại sao chương trình này lại nổi bật ?
Nó khác biệt hoàn toàn với những chương trình truyền hình khác .
Bạn không thể lên kế hoạch cho những gì sẽ diễn ra .
Bạn chỉ việc mang theo máy quay .
Chúng tôi không biết gì hơn khi rời Bergen .
Vài người để ý đến lá cờ .
Một vài người bắt đầu tự hỏi , người nông dân có nhà không ?
Anh ta đi đâu rồi ? Có ai trông chừng bò không ?
Con bò đó đi đâu thế ?
Đó là Slow TV .
Xin cảm ơn .
Anastasia Taylor-Lind : Cách mạng Ukraina : Kẻ chiến đấu - Người khóc than
Sau nhiều tháng , chạm trán giữa cảnh sát và người dân ngày càng bị đẩy lên cao .
Chụp ảnh đúng theo cách truyền thống .
Rất nhiều người bị giết chỉ trong một thời gian ngắn .
Khu sảnh của khách sạn Ukraine trở thành một nhà xác tạm thời .
Xác chết ngả rạp thành hàng trên đường .
Máu vấy khắp vỉa hè .
Ngày hôm sau , tổng thống Yanukovych trốn khỏi Ukraine .
Lịch sử diễn ra quá nhanh nhưng trong lòng Maidan , mọi thứ vẫn rất khó nắm bắt .
Nỗi đau bao trùm Maidan .
Thinh lặng đến mức tôi nghe thấy cả tiếng chim hót
mà trước đây , tôi chưa từng nghe thấy .
Phần lớn họ đều bật khóc khi lên hình .
Đàn ông lao vào chiến đấu còn đàn bà khóc than cho họ .
Tôi mới quay lại Ukraine 6 tuần trước .
Những chiến binh , phụ nữ và những đoá hoa đều đã biến mất .
&quot; Vinh quang về tay Ukraine , Vinh quang cho những anh hùng . &quot;
Cảm ơn các bạn đã lắng nghe .
Nhưng chúng tôi có một vài vấn đề .
Có thể các bạn cũng đã biết .
Đất nước chúng tôi có cuộc chiến tranh du kích dài nhất trong lịch sử ,
Đã có những vụ khủng bố , những vụ đánh bom ngẫu nhiên .
Rõ ràng , đó không phải là điều tốt . Thực sự rất không tốt .
Gần như là chiến tranh Bolivia thứ hai vậy .
Đã có rất rất nhiều người chết một cách vô ích .
Hãy giải ngũ .
Đêm Giáng Sinh , mọi chuyện đều có thể &quot;
Làm thế nào chúng tôi biết những cây này có tác dụng ?
Tôi sẽ nói về bốn năm trước khi có những cái cây này .
Nhưng chúng tôi chưa biết nhiều về cuộc chiến này .
Tôi muốn kể cho các bạn một trong số đó .
Người các bạn đang thấy tên là Giovanni Andres .
Giovanni Andres 25 tuổi khi chụp bức ảnh này .
Và anh ta làm thật .
Chuyện là họ đã gặp được nhau .
Tôi biết các bạn đang thắc mắc điều đó .
Họ đã gặp nhau .
Để chỉ huy nói với những người chỉ huy .
Đó là khi chiến dịch Những cây thông Noel bắt đầu .
Chúng tôi dùng đường sông &quot;
Chúng tôi đã thu được hơn 6.000 lời nhắn .
Có những tờ giấy ghi hãy rời khỏi đó đi .
Một số lại là đồ chơi , có cả bánh kẹo .
Rất nhiều cái đã được lấy đi .
Đến một lúc nào đó , mình sẽ thoát khỏi đây &quot; .
thay vào đó là &quot; Liệu tôi có bị từ chối ?
Cảm ơn .
Đó là lúc chúng tôi quyết định phối hợp với cộng đồng .
Đầu tiên là những bà mẹ trong mùa Giáng Sinh .
Tiếp theo nữa là những người còn lại .
Tôi không -- Cảm ơn .
Chúng tôi rất sẵn lòng giúp đỡ .
Xin cảm ơn .
Rosie King : Tự kỉ để tôi được là chính mình
Tôi còn bị tự kỉ nữa .
Nó không nói . Không thể nói gì .
Nhưng tôi lại thích nói .
Không chỉ với người bị tự kỉ ,
Tôi tra google &quot; người tự kỉ là ... &quot;
và kết quả trên cùng là &quot; ma quỷ &quot; .
Họ biết .
Để tôi giải thích một chút .
Đó là một trong những điều về tự kỉ .
Bạn không phải vội vàng làm điều đó .
Mặc dù có nhiều vấn đề .
Khi nghĩ về điều đó , điều gì là bình thường ?
Điều đó có nghĩa gì ?
Hãy tưởng tượng đó là lời khen hay nhất bạn từng nhận được .
&quot; Wow , bạn thật sự bình thường . &quot;
&quot; Bạn thật tuyệt vời . &quot;
Tại sao lại đổ ánh sáng rực rỡ của riêng mình vào 1 cái khuôn ?
Xin cảm ơn .
Joe Landolina : Loại gel giúp cầm máu ngay tức thì
Tế bào là đơn vị cơ bản nhất của sự sống .
Nhưng hiếm người biết tiếp theo là gì .
Ví dụ , hãy nghĩ đến rừng mưa nhiệt đới
Đó chính là công nghệ Cám ơn
Xin cám ơn rất nhiều .
David Grady : Làm thế nào để cứu thế giới khỏi những buổi họp tệ hại
chẳng có chương trình cụ thể
dù gì thì bạn cũng đồng ý đến cuộc họp .
Đó là thời gian . Thời gian của các bạn .
Cộng tác là chìa khoá thành công của mọi doanh nghiệp
và một cuộc họp tốt có thể mang lại những kết quả tích cực và khả thi .
Để tôi giải thích cho các bạn .
Mọi thứ như sụp đổ thành đống đổ nát của con tàu .
Và mọi người bỏ đi trong giận dữ .
Thật buồn cười .
Hãy xem đoạn video đó .
Chào Joe , cám ơn vì đã tham gia .
Giờ đã gần con số một triệu .
Tôi khóc và khóc nhiều hơn nữa . &quot;
Đây là những lời bình luận thật và đáng buồn .
Sự thật là , ta không hề bất lực .
No MAS rất đơn giản .
Ngay cạnh &quot; accept &quot; - đồng ý
và bạn sẽ cẩn trọng hơn trong việc chấp nhận lời mời .
Người ta có thể sẽ gửi lịch trình cuộc họp . Tưởng tượng xem !
Xin cảm ơn
Vincent Moon and Naná Vasconcelos : Hidden music rituals around the world
And actually , why do we record ?
We were crazy about music .
We started to publish every week sessions on the Internet .
We are going to see a few extracts now .
So I went on five-year travels around the globe .
My desire was to make it as a trek .
Well , or other drinks , depending on where you are .
In Peru , they drink pisco sour .
This is important to record that whole person .
This is important to create this exchange .
Are you a journalist ? NGO ? Politics ?
What kind of problems are you going to study ? &quot;
I just want to represent them in a beautiful light .
They &apos;re going to think about it differently .
It may be a way to maintain a certain diversity .
Why you will record ?
What &apos;s the point of that ?
Where do we go with it ?
Where is this all coming from ?
Maybe a few more extracts now .
I &apos;m doing it with Priscilla Telmon .
It &apos;s research on the new spiritualities all around the country .
Why do we record ?
I was still there .
I really believe cinema teaches us to see .
I think we are recording to regain a certain complexity .
And it &apos;s very simple .
Muito obrigado .
Vincent , Vincent , Vincent .
You don &apos;t do much editing .
It &apos;s correct ?
Tell us a couple of things .
When did you do a video with him ?
So it was one of your first ones in Brazil .
So let &apos;s introduce him . Who are we waiting for ?
VM : I &apos;ll just make it very short .
Please welcome Naná Vasconcelos .
Naná Vasconcelos !
Naná Vasconcelos : Let &apos;s go to the jungle .
He was that most unlikely of heroes , an economist .
And you &apos;re absolutely right .
It &apos;s dry as a bone .
Kuznets &apos; report was delivered at a moment of crisis .
Struggling because they didn &apos;t know what was going on .
They didn &apos;t have data and statistics .
And now today , every country produces GDP statistics .
It &apos;s in the introductory chapter .
It &apos;s not a measure of our well-being .
And it shouldn &apos;t be a guide to all decision making .
But we have ignored Kuznets &apos; warning .
Our politicians boast when GDP goes up .
Our societies have become engines to create more GDP .
But we know that GDP is flawed .
It ignores the environment .
It counts bombs and prisons as progress .
It can &apos;t count happiness or community .
And it has nothing to say about fairness or justice .
Do I have enough to eat ?
Can I read and write ?
Am I safe ?
Do I have rights ?
These are questions that GDP does not and cannot answer .
It &apos;s a whole new way of looking at the world .
Together , these 12 components form the Social Progress framework .
Not indicators of effort or intention , but real achievement .
Okay , I &apos;m going to show you .
I &apos;m going to show you on this chart .
Higher is better .
Further to the right is more .
Well done ! Never been ; must go .
I &apos;ve never been ; maybe next year .
Or maybe the year after .
Now , I know what you &apos;re thinking .
It &apos;s a good point , well made .
But let me show you two other countries .
So what &apos;s going on ? Well , look .
There we go . Lots of dots .
Come on , cheer !
Go , Brazil !
So this shows the average relationship between GDP and social progress .
I &apos;ll show you an example of Brazil .
And look , Brazil &apos;s above the line .
But where does Brazil go next ?
But that is only half a plan .
We don &apos;t want Brazil to become like Russia .
And it &apos;s not just about countries .
We did it for the Amazon region .
We all know and love TEDx ; this is Social Pogress-x .
This is a tool for anyone to come and use .
Thank you .
Ramanan Laxminarayan : The coming crisis in antibiotics
That small scratch became infected .
His fever went down , his appetite came back .
Second day , he was doing much better .
Day four , well on the way to recovery .
This was a miracle .
Millions have lived , and global health has been transformed .
Now , what did that lead us to ?
This is serious .
Now watch what happens when we play the video .
Now , these are not separate .
Whereas how do we stay ahead of the bacteria ?
A third option might include something like tradeable permits .
And certainly consumer education works .
It &apos;s a fairly cheap drug .
But what is that really telling us ?
So we need to think about that .
It includes bacteriophages , probiotics , quorum sensing , synbiotics .
But there are challenges here .
We don &apos;t want to just throw money at a problem .
So it &apos;s not as if these are permanent solutions .
Viruses are becoming resistant .
Agricultural pests . Malaria parasites .
Mosquitos develop resistance .
So those are also resistant .
And we have to bring an example from across the pond .
Turns out that rats are also resistant to poisons .
And so we stand at a crossroads .
Thank you .
Haas &amp; amp ; Hahn : How painting can transform communities
But Vila Cruzeiro is also the place where our story begins .
Now , we learned that favelas are informal communities .
Where we &apos;re from , in Holland , everything is planned .
Who would expect something like that in a place like this ?
So we thought , would that even be possible ?
But somehow the idea stuck .
JK : We had a friend .
He ran an NGO in Vila Cruzeiro .
His name was Nanko , and he also liked the idea .
It &apos;s when a house is finished . &quot;
They said , &quot; What did you do ?
In a favela , that is not a good thing .
Also the same color as the prison cell .
We said , &quot; Uh , it &apos;s art .
And this image somehow went all over the world .
So we immediately said yes .
JK : So now we had painted a whole street .
How about we do this whole hill now ?
How many square meters is that ?
And maybe it &apos;s a mistake to think like that .
Together with them , we decided where to start .
This article about Angelo appeared .
DU : Thank you .
Let &apos;s start with the global challenge of urbanization .
It &apos;s a fact that people are moving towards cities .
and even if counterintuitive , it &apos;s good news .
Evidence shows that people are better off in cities .
A one million-person city per week with 10,000 dollars per family .
Detached houses , 30 families could be accommodated .
Row houses , 60 families .
We had to innovate .
So what did we do ?
Our design was something in between a building and a house .
This was our first project in Iquique 10 years ago .
This is our last project in Chile .
The second case is how design can contribute to sustainability .
Well , how does that building look , typically ?
You may also open those windows and get cross-ventilation .
None of this is rocket science .
You don &apos;t require sophisticated programming .
It &apos;s not about technology .
First one : Forbid installation on ground zero .
Thirty million dollars spent mainly in land expropriation .
So this alternative was irresponsible .
Vote for Constitución .
Go to the Open House and express your options .
Participate !
Fisherman : I am a fisherman .
Twenty-five fishermen work for me .
Where should I take them ? To the forest ?
So why can &apos;t we have a concrete defense ?
Done well , of course .
I am the history of Constitución .
and my grandchildren and everyone else will .
But why are you imposing this on me ?
You ! You are imposing this on me !
In danger zone I am not authorized to build .
He himself is saying that .
No , no , no , Nieves ...
There is nothing worse than answering well the wrong question .
It &apos;s poor and it &apos;s scarce .
The sum of them : 52 million dollars .
It is life itself .
Thank you so much .
Kare Anderson : Be an opportunity maker
Do you dare raise your hand ?
Remember , I was young then .
So what did they do ?
What we still do perhaps too often .
We talk about ourselves .
That &apos;s why I &apos;m sitting here .
I said , &quot; I know someone you ought to meet .
He had workout regime he did every day .
I think she was following me at that point .
I said , &quot; He &apos;d be an unexpected ally . &quot;
I think they &apos;d make good allies .
And indeed they were .
They met together . They prepared .
They spoke in front of the Los Angeles City Council .
They were startling , compelling and credible .
You can &apos;t buy that .
That &apos;s what opportunity-makers do .
It &apos;s especially important now .
Why is it important now ?
And he thought , I have a set of racquetball courts .
That guy could teach it .
They &apos;re frequent travelers .
They could practice in their hotel room , no equipment provided .
That &apos;s how Wally got hired .
Not only that , years later he was also teaching racquetball .
Years after that , he was teaching the racquetball teachers .
So here &apos;s what I &apos;m calling for you to do .
Remember the three traits of opportunity-makers .
Opportunity-makers keep honing their top strength and they become pattern seekers .
Thank you very much .
Frans Lanting : Photos that give voice to the animal kingdom
When they arrived , they would all take off their skins .
I want to get under the skin .
You may wonder , do I ever photograph people ?
You just have to learn how to look past their disguise .
Let &apos;s find a way to join the dance .
Thank you .
Sergei Lupashin : A flying camera ... on a leash
I came here to show you the Fotokite .
It &apos;s a tethered , flying camera .
Here &apos;s one of the panoramas .
You just can &apos;t consider this insignificant .
And it make sense . It &apos;s such a unique perspective .
One is piloting .
It &apos;s quite heavy , lots of spinning , sharp things .
So we already have cameras .
There are more and more of them .
You hear about people with Google Glass being attacked .
Here &apos;s some personal input I didn &apos;t expect .
But I think there are better solutions .
I think we have to defuse the situation .
And this is one potential solution .
So this is the Fotokite .
It &apos;s literally a dog leash . It &apos;s very convenient .
You give it a little twist .
That &apos;s kind of the way you communicate .
And there it goes .
So the interaction is super simple .
It &apos;s like a personal flying pet .
You can turn it on .
So I just shifted its position .
And it &apos;s really safe .
You don &apos;t have to look for someone controlling it .
What would you use it for ?
What would you use such a camera for in your life ?
Thank you .
The child comes flying out through centrifugal force .
How does this happen ?
Their brain does not slosh around like ours does .
And the woodpecker maybe relates to that .
After a year , he still smelled putrid .
After two years , still smelled putrid .
Three years , four years , still smelled putrid .
After five years , it went away on its own .
It &apos;s a mystery .
Try one of two conditions .
Every year we give out 10 prizes .
That &apos;s the quality we look for .
What do you get if you win an Ig Nobel prize ?
Well , you get several things .
These are always handmade from extremely cheap materials .
That &apos;s the heart of the ceremony .
Keep in mind , we &apos;ve given 230 prizes .
There are lots of these people who walk among you .
Maybe you have one .
It was written by Dr. Peter Barss , who is Canadian .
So he went to Papua New Guinea .
You &apos;re all familiar with colonoscopies , one way or another .
And there were some difficulties at first .
And so , you want to have a larger space .
So they added oxygen to methane gas .
And that &apos;s where the idea came from .
Thank you .
Fabien Cousteau : What I learned from spending 31 days underwater
I have a confession to make .
But they didn &apos;t test for curiosity .
Maybe you &apos;ve heard of her .
It &apos;s called Aquarius .
In other ways , it &apos;s a legacy .
We had megafauna come and visit us .
So mission 31 wasn &apos;t so much about breaking records .
It was about that human-ocean connection .
It &apos;s like seeing dogs and cats behaving well together .
Now , this wasn &apos;t just about adventure .
There was actually a serious note to it .
And finally , we looked at predator-prey behavior .
It &apos;s available to every one of us .
We had never seen that before .
And I &apos;ve thought about this my whole life .
Nothing is impossible .
Thank you very much .
This time , it was different .
There were no coups .
Everything worked . Great education .
Six years later , I returned to the country .
Everything was different .
It had shattered into pieces .
How could a country go so bad so fast ?
Most people would agree that it &apos;s all because of leadership .
The first is it made me fall in love with Africa .
Let me make it a bit more concrete .
You become the president of the United States .
So you decide , perhaps let me pass a law .
You say , &quot; Let me try this way . &quot;
You say , perhaps , &quot; Let me print some money .
I think the economy needs a stimulus . &quot;
The central bank governor will think you &apos;re crazy .
You might get impeached for that .
You decide you want to print money .
We &apos;ve had three generations of leaders , in my mind .
The legacy they left is that they brought independence to Africa .
They were followed by generation two .
These are people that brought nothing but havoc to Africa .
Think warfare , corruption , human rights abuses .
So where to from here ?
Why is prosperity so important ?
And she &apos;s just turned 18 .
Another example is Erick Rajaonary .
Erick comes from the island of Madagascar .
Erick is known as the Batman .
No , I don &apos;t think so .
Laetitia is one of our young leaders .
But one thing has been troubling me .
But we couldn &apos;t satisfy it .
But they won &apos;t just learn academics .
But what we &apos;re doing is just one group of institutions .
We cannot transform Africa by ourselves .
You can be that great generation . &quot;
Thank you .
Melissa Fleming : Let &apos;s help refugees thrive , not just survive
So when I meet refugees , I always ask them questions .
Who bombed your house ?
Who killed your son ?
Did the rest of your family make it out alive ?
How are you coping in your life in exile ?
And he would risk his life to get that diploma .
On his way to school , he would dodge snipers .
But one day , the family got terrible news .
Their throats were slit .
It was time to flee .
But they would begin a life of grueling hardship and monotony .
This is generosity and humanity that is remarkable .
Think about it this way , proportionately .
Six and a half million people have fled for their lives .
I took this picture of this little girl .
It allows them to think of hope rather than hatred .
And she said yes , but she refused to smile .
Hany &apos;s home was also destroyed .
Refugees have a lot of time to prepare for their return .
Well far from it .
And there are more and more victims .
They flee across borders like this one .
Well , I think that should be the minimum .
Thank you .
We can help them thrive .
And imagine living in this camp .
I visited this camp .
It was dusty and it was terribly hot .
My schooling days are over . &quot;
And I also thought , what a waste .
She should be and she is the future of Somalia .
So I want to take you back to Hany .
Hany is at a tipping point .
University is a luxury .
Thank you .
Jorge Soto : The future of early cancer detection ?
Almost a year ago , my aunt started suffering back pains .
It was stage 3 lung cancer .
Her lifestyle was almost free of risk .
So microRNAs are small molecules that regulate gene expression .
It is the uncontrolled regulation of genes .
Let me do a demonstration .
This entire platform is a working prototype .
You don &apos;t need to have any symptoms .
Today , cancer detection happens mainly when symptoms appear .
It is too expensive for our families .
It is too expensive for humanity .
We cannot lose the war against cancer .
However , I want fights like this to become very rare .
Thank you very much .
Sleep .
You can actually see it in this video here .
It was ingenious , but it was also beautiful .
Let me tell you about what we found .
We call it the CSF .
You can see that in these videos .
This is a solution that is entirely unique to the brain .
It &apos;s almost nothing .
Thank you .
My father was a government worker .
So I wanted to be a poet when I grew up .
My story is not unique .
There are millions of people who migrate each year .
There are 232 million international migrants in the world .
Those sums of money are called remittances .
In Tajikistan , remittances are 42 percent of GDP .
They actually act like an insurance .
Migrants send more money then .
Remittances are dollars wrapped with care .
Foremost among them is the exorbitant cost of sending money home .
Money transfer companies structure their fees to milk the poor .
The global average cost of sending money is eight percent .
For example , sending money from Benin to Nigeria .
It all goes in suitcases .
Whereever costs are high , money goes underground .
There are .
Remittances are the lifeblood of Somalia .
I cannot go to a cheaper option .
This has to go .
First , relax regulations on small remittances under 1,000 dollars .
Governments should recognize that small remittances are not money laundering .
You have seen what has happened there .
I was in Dubai a few years ago .
I visited a camp for workers .
The remittance arrives .
This has to stop .
The family doesn &apos;t get to see any of it .
It is not only men .
Women are especially vulnerable to recruitment malpractices .
You can also do the same for mobilizing diaspora giving .
Remittances empower people .
And it can be done .
My wife is a Venezuelan .
My children are Americans .
Increasingly , I feel like a global citizen .
My parents are not there anymore .
My brothers and sisters have moved on .
There is no real urgency for me to send money home .
Thank you .
Pia Mancini : How to upgrade democracy for the Internet era
And the many get to vote once every couple of years .
We want our seat at the table .
And rightly so .
And we should be immensely proud of this .
What institutions do we want to build for the 21st-century society ?
I don &apos;t have the answer , just in case .
I don &apos;t think anyone does .
So DemocracyOS is about persuading and being persuaded .
And yes , we failed .
We failed big time .
We were sent to play outside like little kids .
Amongst other things , we were called naive .
It was our way of hacking the political system .
But it got attention .
I &apos;m not saying it &apos;s easy .
And in my heart , it &apos;s most definitely worth trying .
Thank you .
Let &apos;s take a look .
I live there on the corner .
Does that sound like fun ? Yes !
Now you may ask , why have I done these things ?
They &apos;re not really typical for a musician &apos;s day-to-day life .
It started a couple of years ago .
So I downloaded the sheet music and started playing .
The first piece that I played through started like this .
Well this sounds very melancholic , doesn &apos;t it ?
And I turned the page and what came next was this .
Well , this sounds very energetic , doesn &apos;t it ?
And I consider these two elements to be vital human expressions .
And I would like to invite you to do so now .
Thank you .
Nancy Kanwisher : A neural portrait of the human mind
Do you need new glasses ?
Are you losing your mind ?
You run through a quick mental checklist .
And everything looks normal except the children &apos;s faces .
Here we go .
It &apos;s not that easy . It &apos;s an artichoke .
Broccoli ! It &apos;s a head of broccoli .
Isn &apos;t it beautiful ? I love that .
In fact , it &apos;s my brain .
We &apos;re going through slices through my head like that .
So here &apos;s how this works .
Brains are like muscles .
So I was the first subject .
Is it really specialized just for face recognition ?
Well , maybe not , right ?
No , we haven &apos;t .
So let &apos;s watch what happens .
All right ?
Patient : Okay .
Neurologist : One , two , three .
Patient : Nothing . Neurologist : Nothing ? Okay .
I &apos;m going to do it one more time .
Look at my face .
One , two , three .
Patient : You just turned into somebody else .
Your face metamorphosed .
Your nose got saggy , it went to the left .
That was a trip .
So let &apos;s get started . Here &apos;s my right hemisphere .
Okay , now let &apos;s look at these same regions .
Yes , we do .
So here in pink are my language regions .
And his region responded the same to both sets of images .
So much for &quot; Oprah . &quot;
I mean , it could have been otherwise .
It &apos;s early days in this enterprise .
The most fundamental questions remain unanswered .
Second , how are all these things connected in the brain ?
Susan Colantuono : The career advice you probably didn &apos;t get
I met her two years ago .
I don &apos;t understand why I &apos;m being passed over . &quot;
So pay attention to the green box as I move forward .
Here &apos;s what I mean by that .
So which element of leadership does that relate to ?
Personal greatness .
Which element of leadership does that equate to ?
Engaging the greatness in others .
And then they pretty much stopped .
So this is obvious , right ?
But how can it be ?
This doesn &apos;t mean that this advice is unimportant .
Well , there are primarily two ways .
So what &apos;s women &apos;s experience as it relates to mentoring ?
And he was sincere about that .
Thank you .
Eman Mohammed : The courage to tell a hidden story
The male-dominated field made my presence unwelcome by all possible means .
The &quot; No &quot; sign was pretty clear .
The perception of women &apos;s life in Gaza is passive .
To men , women &apos;s stories were seen as inconsequential .
I started paying closer attention to women &apos;s lives in Gaza .
Thank you .
Kenneth Cukier : Big data is better data
America &apos;s favorite pie is ?
How do we know it ?
Because of data .
You look at supermarket sales .
The majority of the sales are apple .
Why ? What happened ?
Okay , think about it .
You can get your first choice .
You have more data .
More data allows us to see new .
It allows us to see better .
It allows us to see different .
Now , you probably all have heard the term big data .
This is how society stored and transmitted information .
Now , society hasn &apos;t advanced all that much .
Searching it is easier . Copying it easier .
Sharing it is easier . Processing it is easier .
There is , if you will , a liquidity to information .
More data . More .
Think , for example , the question of location .
Take , for example , Martin Luther .
In this respect , location has been datafied .
So what could we do with this ?
What could we do then ?
So what is the value of big data ?
Well , think about it .
You have more information .
You can do things that you couldn &apos;t do before .
And it will help you understand it by seeing its origins .
He played . He won .
He played . He won .
Arthur Samuel knew something else .
Arthur Samuel knew strategy .
He plays the computer . He wins .
He plays the computer . He wins .
He plays the computer . He wins .
And then Arthur Samuel leaves the computer to play itself .
It plays itself . It collects more data .
And this idea of machine learning is going everywhere .
How do you think we have self-driving cars ?
No . Memory is cheaper . No .
Algorithms are faster . No . Processors are better . No .
All of those things matter , but that &apos;s not why .
It &apos;s because we changed the nature of the problem .
You figure it out .
The problem : The medical literature only knew nine of them .
Now , there are dark sides to big data as well .
Privacy was the central challenge in a small data era .
The person went to university .
The person buys property .
He or she votes .
He or she is a stakeholder in society .
It &apos;s not just a problem for the National Security Agency .
We are at a remarkable moment in time .
Let me illustrate with an example .
Like most other people , I moved around Beijing by bicycle .
Cycling in Beijing now is a completely different prospect .
The roads are jammed by cars and trucks .
How did this come about ?
It has become the world &apos;s second largest economy .
Hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of poverty .
That &apos;s really important .
China &apos;s planning to scale back coal .
It &apos;s looking to build its cities in different ways .
That &apos;s a remarkable change .
Fifty percent now in urban areas .
That &apos;s going to go to 70 percent in 2050 .
This is profound structural change .
That would transform the relationship between human beings and the planet .
And we couldn &apos;t just turn it off .
You can &apos;t make a peace treaty with the planet .
You can &apos;t negotiate with the laws of physics .
You &apos;re in there . You &apos;re stuck .
Those two transformations face us in the next two decades .
And let me start with cities .
Now , some things in cities do take time .
Some things in cities can happen much more quickly .
Take my hometown , London .
And it happened all the time .
For those of you live outside London in the U.K.
will remember it used to be called The Smoke .
That &apos;s the way London was .
I remember the smogs well .
This was the 1950s .
I had to walk home three miles from school .
Again , breathing was a hazardous activity .
But it was changed . It was changed by a decision .
Good decisions can bring good results , striking results , quickly .
Let me turn to energy .
Eighty percent of that comes from fossil fuels .
We can see how to do that .
Take the example of California .
That &apos;s a striking achievement .
It shows what can be done .
They &apos;ve set themselves a target of five years .
I think they &apos;ve got a good chance of doing that .
Look at land , land and particularly forests .
Forests are the hosts to valuable plant and animal species .
But we &apos;re losing our forests .
And it &apos;s not just stopping deforestation .
I first went to Ethiopia in 1967 .
You &apos;re seeing that commitment there .
You &apos;re seeing what can be done .
Ethiopia is investing in clean energy .
It &apos;s working in the rehabilitation of land .
We do understand how to manage those well .
And technology is changing very rapidly .
You can see better insulation .
And there &apos;s much more coming .
We &apos;re not cutting emissions in the way we should .
We &apos;re not managing those structural transformations as we can .
We need political pressure to build .
We need leaders to step up .
We know that we can do this .
Two weeks old .
Avi Reichental : What &apos;s next in 3D printing
My grandfather was a cobbler .
Back in the day , he made custom-made shoes .
I never got to meet him .
He perished in the Holocaust .
It &apos;s a little older than TED .
So think about useful things .
You all know your shoe size .
Anybody ?
It wasn &apos;t made to measure .
And we did . We built her an amazing suit .
And you know what ? She &apos;s not standing still .
She now wants to walk in high heels .
It doesn &apos;t stop there .
Millions of in-the-ear hearing aids are already 3D printed today .
Millions of people are served today from these devices .
Good for G.E. , right ?
And their customers and the environment .
A real moonshot , powered by 3D printing .
How about food ?
With 3D printing , complexity is free .
That will take new tools .
I think it &apos;s the wrong question to ask .
Now , these are not my grandfather &apos;s shoes .
He passed away three years ago .
Thank you .
Mac Barnett : Why a good book is a secret door
Hi everybody . So my name is Mac .
So how could I untangle this knotted bunch of sentences ?
That liminal space , that &apos;s art .
I used to be a summer camp counselor .
It was a sports summer camp for four- to six-year-olds .
And she was like , &quot; Why ? &quot;
And so Riley was like , &quot; That will never happen .
That &apos;s not going to happen . &quot;
It &apos;s anything . Art can get us to that place .
I &apos;m going to call it wonder .
It &apos;s not just kids who can get there .
Adults can too , and we get there when we read .
I think kids are the best audience for serious literary fiction .
And I was happy to tell her all about it .
This is a place called 826 Valencia .
You don &apos;t know . Black is boring . Pastel .
It &apos;s a secret door that you can walk through .
So we have The Echo Park Time Travel Mart .
And it &apos;s on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles .
Our friendly staff is ready to help you .
Some great people have come up through our ranks .
This is our kind of pharmacy section .
It was going to be the highlight of our store .
Dead languages .
Leeches , nature &apos;s tiny doctors .
The joke isn &apos;t a joke .
I see it as kind of a book in three dimensions .
It &apos;s almost as old as storytelling itself .
And one metafictive technique is breaking the fourth wall . Right ?
For me , I kind of prefer the opposite .
And so I try to do this in my books .
And here &apos;s just one example .
This is the first book that I ever made .
A lot of hills , real estate is at a premium .
This market &apos;s crazy , everybody .
And kids do write in .
Eliot Gannon . &quot;
And they get a picture of their whale too .
This is the first message I ever got from Nico .
Nico : Hello , this is Nico .
I am your owner , Randolph . Hello .
And here &apos;s another one of Nico &apos;s messages .
Nico : Hello , Randolph , this is Nico .
He &apos;s left over 25 messages for Randolph over four years .
This is the Christmas message from Nico .
But Nico &apos;s the best reader I could hope for .
Thank you very much .
Uldus Bakhtiozina : Wry photos that turn stereotypes upside down
Good afternoon .
My name is Uldus .
I am a photo-based artist from Russia .
Next portrait interpretation is metaphoric .
And what about me ?
I &apos;m 27 years old .
Be brave . Be ironic — it helps .
Be funny and create some magic .
Use this device . Use this device to answer .
Please answer A , B or C.
Oh , very , very good .
And we go to the next question .
A , B or C ? Please answer .
And we go to the next question .
Extreme poverty — not having enough food for the day .
A , B or C ?
Now , answers .
And then , how did that change ?
Gapminder asked the public in Sweden .
This is how they answered .
So only 12 percent of the Swedes know this .
So I went to the zoo and I asked the chimps .
Now how did you do ?
That &apos;s you .
You were beaten by the chimps .
But it was close .
You shouldn &apos;t compare yourself to Swedes .
You must have higher ambitions in the world .
Here , you can see men went eight years .
How long did women go to school ?
Let &apos;s see , let &apos;s see . Here we come .
Yes , yes , yes , women have almost caught up .
This is the U.S. public .
And this is you . Here you come .
Ooh .
Now , we miss the majority .
What about poverty ?
And you ?
Ah , you almost made it to the chimps .
That little , just a few of you !
There must be preconceived ideas , you know .
Look here . This is how it was in 1975 .
The world was two groups .
The percent in poverty has decreased .
Still it &apos;s appalling that so many remain in extreme poverty .
Well , it &apos;s me . It &apos;s me .
It &apos;s very difficult , this . It &apos;s very difficult .
So Ola told me , &quot; Take these devices .
You are invited to media conferences .
Give it to them and measure what the media know . &quot;
And then , lately , from the European Union media .
The problem is that the media doesn &apos;t know themselves .
What shall we do about this , Ola ?
Do we have any ideas ?
That &apos;s basically what I will do .
It &apos;s Hudiksvall . It &apos;s a city in northern Sweden .
It was not representative . Okay ?
So this is the first piece of the ignorance puzzle .
We have a personal bias .
So that &apos;s what we are focusing on .
What happens next is news , okay ?
Unusual events are more interesting , no ?
It was good in evolution .
It was supposed to be our strength , wasn &apos;t it ?
So how do we solve such problems ?
Okay , I gather those facts .
Imagine a long list with , say , 250 facts .
Of course you shouldn &apos;t .
So now we come to the practical tricks .
How are you going to succeed ?
That will never happen , actually .
Not even Hans thinks that &apos;s going to happen .
People don &apos;t have that time .
People like shortcuts , and here are the shortcuts .
We need to turn our intuition into strength again .
We need to be able to generalize .
Let &apos;s start with the first misconception .
This is very widespread .
Everything is getting worse .
You heard it . You thought it yourself .
The other way to think is , most things improve .
Okay ? Don &apos;t go for the worse .
That will help you score better on our tests .
That was the first one .
There are rich and poor and the gap is increasing .
It &apos;s a terrible inequality .
That &apos;s going to help you get the answer right .
No , no , no . That &apos;s wrong .
Let &apos;s look at the last one .
I actually , I &apos;m very afraid of sharks .
That &apos;s a rule of thumb .
Of course there are dangerous things that are also great .
They cannot generalize these kinds of rules .
That &apos;s a systematic approach .
Now the question , is this important ?
We &apos;re going back to these two humps in 1975 .
That &apos;s the current EU countries and North America .
But this has changed , okay ?
Today it &apos;s 50 / 50 .
The Western domination is over , as of today .
That &apos;s nice . So what &apos;s going to happen next ?
I did that , but I went even further .
Let &apos;s move into the future .
In 2020 , it &apos;s 57 percent in the rest .
In 2025 , 63 percent .
These are just projections of GDP per capita into the future .
Thank you very much .
Hans and Ola Rosling !
The New York City that I encountered felt pretty built up .
I just didn &apos;t really know how .
It &apos;s really pretty remarkable .
You can see the six solar collectors at the center there .
Thanks .
Colin Grant : How our stories cross over
This is my father , Clinton George &quot; Bageye &quot; Grant .
Maybe it &apos;s a migrant lesson .
&quot; You are being watched .
Actually , you are .
You are being watched . &quot;
That was his mantra to us , his children .
Time and time again he would say this to us .
You are being watched , so confound their expectations of you .
Now , there was no tradition of wearing trilbies in Jamaica .
They invented that tradition for their arrival here .
So Bageye is bald and has baggy eyes .
Tidy Boots is very fussy about his footwear .
Anxious is always anxious .
Clock has one arm longer than the other .
And my all-time favorite was the guy they called Summerwear .
You did not just represent yourself .
So that was what needed to be challenged .
They were built to transmit but not receive .
We were to keep quiet .
But they do care , actually .
They cross over .
Somehow they find their way to you .
So listen to how I sound .
The children became the parents to the parent .
The reality was very much different .
Having started the process , my father did not continue .
And I wonder what Bageye would make of that .
I was very disconcerted by that .
But I never felt that connection .
This will close the generation gap , perhaps .
This could be an instrument of repair .
Poor , deluded fool .
And it was a coruscating account of my betrayal .
I was no son of his .
I lost my hatred of my father .
And I wonder whether that freedness could be transferred to him .
This is a photograph of me , nine months old .
But there &apos;s another way of looking at this photograph .
I was almost a foot taller than my father .
There was dignity in defeat .
Thank you .
Shubhendu Sharma : How to grow a tiny forest anywhere
I &apos;m an industrial engineer .
I wanted to make more of these forests .
But that &apos;s not enough .
This methodology , I believe , has a potential .
By sharing , we can actually bring back our native forests .
Thank you very much . Thanks .
Isabel Allende : How to live passionately — no matter your age
Hi , kids .
I &apos;m 71 .
My husband is 76 .
So let &apos;s talk about aging .
Me , I intend to live passionately .
When do we start aging ?
I am still 17 .
Sophia Loren . Look at her .
She says that everything you see she owes to spaghetti .
I tried it and gained 10 pounds in the wrong places .
But attitude , aging is also attitude and health .
She has also founded orphanages and nutritional clinics .
She is always happy and eternally young .
What have I lost in the last decades ?
What have I gained ?
Freedom : I don &apos;t have to prove anything anymore .
I don &apos;t have to please men anymore , only animals .
I love my brain .
I feel lighter .
It &apos;s great to let go .
I should have started sooner .
I don &apos;t see it as weakness anymore .
And I &apos;ve gained spirituality .
I &apos;m aware that before , death was in the neighborhood .
Now , it &apos;s next door , or in my house .
I try to live mindfully and be present in the moment .
Meditation helps .
Ommm . Ommm . Ommm .
Isabel Allende : Ommm . Ommm . There it is .
And it &apos;s good to start early .
Nobody else sees that . I &apos;m invisible .
I want to be the center of attention .
I hate to be invisible .
This is Grace Dammann .
She doesn &apos;t see herself as disabled .
In her mind , she &apos;s still surfing in the ocean .
So how can I stay passionate ?
I cannot will myself to be passionate at 71 .
Attitude , attitude .
Yes to life .
And I train by trying to stay in love .
Jubilation . Celebration .
We have paid our dues .
We have contributed to society .
Unless you are ill or very poor , you have choices .
I am working on it every day .
Want to join me ?
Thank you .
So Isabel — I Thank you .
I Oh , of course . About what ?
Moderator : About your erotic fantasies . I With Antonio Banderas .
Once ? Twice ? Seventeen times ?
And she said , &quot; Awesome . &quot;
And I thought , &quot; Really ?
Seriously , can saving anything as a PDF be awesome ?
How about that parking space ? Was that awesome ?
Or that game the other day ? Was that awesome ?
The answer is no , no and no .
Yes , so I think I &apos;ll invent the wheel .
The wheel , ladies and gentlemen .
Is the wheel awesome ? Say it with me .
Yes , the wheel is awesome !
Were the Great Pyramids awesome ?
Yes , the pyramids were awesome .
The Grand Canyon . Come on .
It &apos;s almost 80 million years old .
Is the Grand Canyon awesome ?
Yes , the Grand Canyon is .
I mean , come on . Is photography awesome ?
Yes , photography is awesome .
Was D-Day awesome ? Yes , it was awesome .
Did you eat food today ? Did you eat ?
It &apos;s just like that .
Bees are awesome . Are you kidding me ?
Landing on the moon ! Come on !
Apollo 11 . Are you kidding me ?
That &apos;s like from here to the moon .
You &apos;re damn right , it was .
Tickets were only 24 dollars back then .
You can &apos;t even buy a freaking t-shirt for that now .
Was Woodstock awesome ? Yes , it was awesome .
Sharks ! They &apos;re at the top of the food chain .
Some sharks can lose 30,000 teeth in their lifetime .
Does awesome inspire fear ?
Oh , hell yeah , sharks are awesome !
I will save you the time .
Sally Kohn : Don &apos;t like clickbait ? Don &apos;t click
That &apos;s a thing . Google it .
I &apos;m talking about nasty personal attacks .
Which , incidentally , is only a third correct .
I don &apos;t mean giving up the Internet .
Increasingly , we &apos;re all the media .
That is a public act of making media .
Wrong .
We are the new editors .
That &apos;s how the media works now .
It does not have to be that way .
It does not .
We can change the incentive .
For starters , there are two things we can all do .
If someone is being abused online , do something .
Be a hero . This is your chance .
Speak up . Speak out . Be a good person .
Drown out the negative with the positive .
I know you do it . You too , apparently .
Clicking on a train wreck just pours gasoline on it .
It makes it worse , the fire spreads .
Our whole culture gets burned .
So click responsibly . Thank you .
Rose Goslinga : Crop insurance , an idea worth seeding
That ended the discussion .
Go find us some insurance . &quot;
It &apos;s microinsurance .
So instead , we rely on technology and data .
The data alone isn &apos;t enough .
I was disappointed and confounded .
Why would I buy insurance now ? &quot;
That &apos;s an attractive proposition .
It &apos;s a very different value proposition .
How do you expect me to repay my loan ? &quot;
They couldn &apos;t take on this kind of risk .
Let me tell you one more story .
So they took out loans and planted .
We &apos;ve got you .
Could you give us the money now ?
No more years of the cup .
Thank you .
Martin Rees : Can we prevent the end of the world ?
Americans like instant gratification and the reverse .
The worst have thankfully not yet happened .
Indeed , they probably won &apos;t .
We get ever more vulnerable .
Well , can we guard against such risks by regulation ?
Well luckily , reassurance could be offered .
Biologists should avoid release of potentially devastating genetically modified pathogens .
Scenario A wipes out 90 percent of humanity .
Scenario B wipes out 100 percent .
How much worse is B than A ?
Some would say 10 percent worse .
The body count is 10 percent higher .
But I claim that B is incomparably worse .
And so let &apos;s not jeopardize that future .
Thank you very much .
Ziyah Gafic ́ : Everyday objects , tragic histories
We are all familiar with these mundane , everyday objects .
And it is quite possibly the largest ever discovered .
As much as genocide is about killing .
Not a single body should remain undiscovered or unidentified .
I like to move beyond raising awareness .
Thank you very much .
Jarrett J. Krosoczka : Why lunch ladies are heroes
I thought she lived in the cafeteria with the serving spoons .
I had never thought about any of that before .
But it meant the most to Jeannie .
Kids made hamburger cards that were made out of construction paper .
I didn &apos;t think that anyone noticed us down here . &quot;
A thank you can change a life .
Thank you .
The entire city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site .
Those urban voids quickly became illegal parking or trash yards .
I will show you briefly now two of these public spaces .
Like , you can see here in the Rcif Plaza .
This is how it looked like about six years ago .
This is how it looks like today .
Thank you very much .
Clint Smith : The danger of silence
As a teacher , I &apos;ve internalized this message .
But one year , I gave up speaking .
Silence is the residue of fear .
It is feeling your flaws gut-wrench guillotine your tongue .
It is the sound after the noose is already tied .
I will not let silence wrap itself around my indecision .
Thank you .
Dan Pacholke : How prisons can help inmates live meaningful lives
They can &apos;t contain them , so we must .
That &apos;s our job : contain them , control them .
When we lock someone up , that is no small thing .
And yet , we are called the Department of Corrections .
I followed my dad into this field .
He was a Vietnam veteran . Corrections suited him .
He was strong , steady , disciplined .
In many ways , it was worse .
I walked into a cell house that was five tiers high .
There were eight men to a cell .
there were 550 men in that living unit .
Hundreds of men streamed out of their cells .
I walked away as fast as I could .
Eventually I went back and I started as an officer there .
Contain and control — that was our job .
Guess what ?
It got quieter .
Disturbances died down in the general population .
But isolation isn &apos;t good .
Deprive people of social contact and they deteriorate .
We met violence with force and chaos with chaos .
We were pretty good at putting out fires .
Have you ever thought about how to prevent them ? &quot;
They were patient with me .
Instead of four weeks of training , we gave them 10 .
They both got better at the work .
It was the non-force use of force .
And then we did something even more radical .
We trained the inmates on those same skills .
There were no toilets .
No one had ever heard of a cell without a toilet .
We all thought it was dangerous and crazy .
Even eight men to a cell had a toilet .
That small detail changed the way we worked .
It was easier to detect conflict and intervene before it escalated .
The unit was cleaner , quieter , safer and more humane .
We changed the environment and we changed the behavior .
It &apos;s no small thing to change a prison system .
When we changed the environment , the behavior changed .
And these were not huge system changes .
These were small changes , and these changes created new possibilities .
One of them was a rainforest ecologist .
The way we think about our work changes our work .
The project just made my job more interesting and exciting .
I was excited . Staff were excited .
Officers were excited . Inmates were excited .
They were inspired .
Everybody wanted to be part of this .
Inmates are highly adaptive . They have to be .
And they &apos;re here for a reason .
Remember , IMUs are for punishment .
In fact , they needed intensive programming .
What we found was a new kind of chair .
What I can tell you , though , it is working .
Inmates can be scientists and beekeepers , dog rescuers .
We can contain and control and provide humane environments .
These are not opposing qualities .
Our strategy is not massive system change .
Prisons need to be secure , yes , safe , yes .
We can do that .
We &apos;re learning how to do that .
That &apos;s why I &apos;m hopeful .
We can define that . We can create that .
Thank you .
Talithia Williams : Own your body &apos;s data
Now , as a statistician , what &apos;s my response ?
Show me the data !
Maybe it was shifting around . &quot;
I said okay .
Would your decision be to induce ? &quot;
We can collect more data .
I can try to be really still for 20 minutes .
That makes three of us .
Show me the data !
Let &apos;s talk chances . Let &apos;s talk chances .
So I say , &quot; Okay , great .
Do I go from a 30-percent chance to a 60-percent chance ?
Where are we here with this miscarriage thing ?
Undaunted , I try a different angle .
I &apos;m not anti-medical intervention .
But why were confident to leave that day ?
Well , we had data that told a different story .
We had been collecting data for six years .
In fact , we could probably pretty accurately estimate conception .
Now , what does that data look like ?
You &apos;ll see that the temperature is not random .
So what &apos;s happening here ?
What is that data telling you ?
So why this temperature jump ?
Well , think about when a bird sits on her eggs .
Why is she sitting on them ?
We were really very excited about this chart .
That &apos;s exactly how your thyroid works in your body .
Your thyroid tries to keep an optimal temperature for your body .
If it gets too hot , your thyroid cools you down .
But what happens when your thyroid is not functioning well ?
You &apos;re having a heart attack .
He says , &quot; Well , do you two exercise ? &quot;
We ride our bikes , we go to the gym occasionally .
We move around .
I &apos;m thinking , I was sleeping , honestly .
But okay , what was Donald doing just before ?
So Donald goes into this slew of medications he was taking .
He gives us a prescription .
This is about the heart rate of a healthy 16-year-old .
What story is this data telling you ?
You become the authority .
It &apos;s not hard to do .
Yes , get it up .
I challenge you to take ownership of your data .
Audience : Show me the data !
TW : One more time !
Audience : Show me the data !
TW : Show me the data .
Thank you .
Megan Washington : Why I live in mortal dread of public speaking
I have a problem .
It &apos;s not the worst thing in the world .
I &apos;m fine . I &apos;m not on fire .
And the thing is that I have a stutter .
I &apos;ve never really talked about it before so explicitly .
I &apos;m pretty sure that I &apos;m grown now .
So , I might as well come clean about it .
There are some interesting angles to having a stutter .
People think I &apos;m drunk all the time .
But with people &apos;s names , you can &apos;t change them .
And I do use that . I do .
I get through it that way for my job .
It &apos;s more than feeling known , or understood .
It &apos;s not about mythology , or mythologizing myself to you .
And that &apos;s why I &apos;m here today .
Thank you .
Singing for me is sweet relief .
It is the only time when I feel fluent .
This is a song that I wrote last year .
Thank you very much . Thank you .
Janet Iwasa : How animations can help scientists test a hypothesis
Take a look at this drawing .
Can you tell what it is ?
So we start outside of the cell .
Now we &apos;re looking inside .
Clathrin are these three-legged molecules that can self-assemble into soccer-ball-like shapes .
Why ?
The payoffs can be huge , though .
I believe that animation can change biology .
Thank you .
Ze Frank : Are you human ?
Please raise your hand if something applies to you .
Are we agreed ? Yes ?
Then let &apos;s begin .
Have you ever eaten a booger long past your childhood ?
It &apos;s okay , it &apos;s safe here .
Okay .
Yes .
Yes .
Good .
Mmm .
Yes , it &apos;s safe here .
Mmm .
Congratulations .
You have now completed the test .
You are all human .
I was born in Taiwan .
I also liked to make devices that work with body parts .
I also like to modify household appliances .
This is an automatic night light .
Some of you might have them at home .
This sculpture has four eyes .
Each eye is controlling a different device .
This eye is turning itself around in a television .
This eye is inflating a plastic tube .
This eye is watching a video of another piece being made .
And these two eyes are activating glowing water .
I love science and biology .
Thank you .
David Kwong : Two nerdy obsessions meet -- and it &apos;s magic
Puzzles and magic .
It &apos;s certainly true for me .
I &apos;ve been solving my whole life .
I test your ability to solve .
From birth , we are wired to solve .
And then the pattern was changed : triangle , square .
It &apos;s remarkable .
Like .
Now , solving exists across all cultures .
But many other cultures have their signature puzzles as well .
Chaos . Order .
Order .
And order .
That one &apos;s my favorite , let &apos;s hear it again .
Okay .
Is this not making order out of chaos ?
So as you can see , we are always solving .
We are always trying to decode our world .
It &apos;s an eternal quest .
But anyway , &quot; Don Quixote &quot; is an important book .
You guys have read &quot; Don Quixote , &quot; yes ?
I &apos;m seeing some heads nod .
Come on guys , really ?
There we go . Smart audience .
Who &apos;s read &quot; Don Quixote ? &quot; Get them up .
Let &apos;s see .
Everybody &apos;s looking away all of a sudden .
Gwen , after you .
Are you so excited ?
Okay , stand right here , Gwen , right here .
And over here we have a drawing of some farm animals .
It &apos;s going to be a lot of fun .
But I &apos;m going to go over here .
I don &apos;t want to see what you &apos;re doing .
Now Gwen , are you ready ?
All right . Great .
Big scribbles .
And color in the owl for me .
Color in the owl .
Good , good , good , good , good .
Big , big , big strokes . Good , good .
Okay , good .
Did I forget ? Oh , I forgot my purple marker .
This is still going to work , though .
I think this is still going to work , mostly .
So Gwen , I &apos;m going to hand you this envelope .
An emerald rooster . Okay .
Yes , I think it does .
So ladies and gentlemen , how is this possible ?
Well this is the puzzle I present to you .
Could there be order in the chaos that I created ?
Let &apos;s take a closer look .
Do you recall when I showed you these puzzle pieces ?
What image did it ultimately become ? A cobalt horse .
The plot thickens .
That one &apos;s my favorite .
And then we had an experiment with a silver ox .
Thank you , Katy , for taking that photo for me .
I believe you colored a red donkey , Gwen .
There &apos;s more .
Ladies and gentlemen , we have today &apos;s New York Times .
The date is March 18th , 2014 .
Really dig . We hid them under there .
You can see my name above the grid .
And I will also put it up on the screen .
That &apos;s pretty cool , right ?
It &apos;s The New York Times .
But wait , wait , wait , wait . Wait .
That &apos;s chaos and order .
We &apos;ve all made order out of chaos .
Thank you .
George Takei : Why I love a country that once betrayed me
I &apos;m a veteran of the starship Enterprise .
My mother was born in Sacramento , California .
My father was a San Franciscan .
America suddenly was swept up by hysteria .
That all disappeared .
They carried bayonets on their rifles .
They stomped up the front porch and banged on the door .
I will never be able to forget that scene .
It is burned into my memory .
I still remember the barbed wire fence that confined me .
Children are amazingly adaptable .
We were penniless .
My parents worked hard to get back on their feet .
We had lost everything .
We were denied service , and categorized as enemy non-alien .
All men are created equal .
And they went to fight for this country .
They fought with amazing , incredible courage and valor .
There is one battle that illustrates that .
It was a battle for the Gothic Line .
The Germans thought an attack from the backside would be impossible .
The men of the 442nd decided to do the impossible .
They climbed all night long on that sheer cliff .
They all fell silently .
was broken by the 442nd in 32 minutes .
They are my heroes .
Thank you very much .
Paul Bloom : Can prejudice ever be a good thing ?
And the thing is , these judgments tend to be accurate .
We &apos;re very good at this sort of thing .
Now we might be wrong .
But for the most part , we &apos;re good at this .
Or take bias .
But other times we &apos;re proud of it .
We openly acknowledge it .
The American people are suffering in our country right now .
AC : Governor Perry , what about that ?
Now some of you may reject this .
Tajfel was born in Poland in 1919 .
He got involved in different pursuits .
He helped out the war orphans .
And Tajfel rejected this .
It was entirely bogus .
Their answers had nothing to do with Kandinsky or Klee .
They probably hadn &apos;t heard of the artists .
He just arbitrarily divided them up .
This bias seems to show up very early .
So one of the puppets might like green beans .
The other puppet might like graham crackers .
We see it in political clashes within groups with different ideologies .
Stereotypes can also go awry .
They were the same baseball cards .
And there are different avenues .
If I look at the one , I will . &quot;
Psychologists have explored this .
People don &apos;t tend to deluge people with facts and statistics .
Rather , you show them faces , you show them people .
This is Harriet Beecher Stowe .
And he was talking about &quot; Uncle Tom &apos;s Cabin . &quot;
It could be China or India or a country in Africa .
And Smith says , how would you respond ?
Smith says , that would matter a lot .
You would not sleep that night wondering about that .
Our reason could cause us to override our passions .
This is what a constitution is .
We have bound ourselves .
And we bind ourselves in other ways as well .
But other times we say , &quot; This is wrong . &quot;
Thank you .
Sara Lewis : The loves and lies of fireflies
Maybe something like this .
Are they talking to one another ?
And what happens after the lights go out ?
In person , fireflies are charming .
They &apos;re charismatic .
They &apos;ve been celebrated in art and in poetry for centuries .
Other creatures can enjoy them too .
They flew during the daytime and they didn &apos;t light up .
How do they do that ?
Incredible .
But how could these bright lights have benefited some proto-firefly ?
Fireflies completely reinvent their bodies as they grow .
And firefly light first originated in these juveniles .
But what &apos;s the point to being so conspicuous ?
to any would-be predators .
They &apos;re flying and flashing their hearts out .
I still find it very romantic .
But meanwhile , where are all the females ?
Well , they &apos;re lounging down below surveying their options .
It &apos;s her &quot; come hither &quot; sign .
So he flies closer and he flashes again .
These creatures speak their love in the language of light .
So what exactly do these females consider sexy ?
We decided to conduct some firefly opinion polls to find out .
So it &apos;s not all sweetness and light .
Firefly romance is risky .
His own female responds , &quot; Maybe . &quot;
So then he flashes again .
So a firefly vampire , brought to you by natural selection .
The main culprit : habitat loss .
Do we really need fireflies ?
Thank you .
Julian Treasure : How to speak so that people want to listen
The human voice : It &apos;s the instrument we all play .
It &apos;s the most powerful sound in the world , probably .
And why is that ?
How can we speak powerfully to make change in the world ?
Second , judging .
Third , negativity .
You can fall into this .
It &apos;s hard to listen when somebody &apos;s that negative .
And another form of negativity , complaining .
Well , this is the national art of the U.K.
It &apos;s not spreading sunshine and lightness in the world .
Excuses . We &apos;ve all met this guy .
Maybe we &apos;ve all been this guy .
Some people have a blamethrower .
Penultimate , the sixth of the seven , embroidery , exaggeration .
It demeans our language , actually , sometimes .
And finally , dogmatism , the confusion of facts with opinions .
It &apos;s difficult to listen to that .
So here they are , seven deadly sins of speaking .
These are things I think we need to avoid .
But is there a positive way to think about this ?
Yes , there is .
Fortunately , these things spell a word .
So what do they stand for ?
See if you can guess .
The A is authenticity , just being yourself .
And the L is love .
I mean , my goodness , you look ugly this morning .
Perhaps that &apos;s not necessary .
So hail .
You have an amazing toolbox .
Register , for example .
You can locate your voice , however .
You hear the difference ?
That &apos;s register .
Then we have timbre .
It &apos;s the way your voice feels .
Go and get a voice coach .
Then prosody . I love prosody .
It &apos;s root one for meaning in conversation .
We don &apos;t have to fill it with ums and ahs .
It can be very powerful .
Where did you leave my keys ?
Where did you leave my keys ?
So slightly different meaning in those two deliveries .
And finally , volume .
I can get really excited by using volume .
Sorry about that if I startled anybody .
Some people broadcast the whole time .
Try not to do that .
Warm up your voice .
Actually , let me show you how to do that .
Would you all like to stand up for a moment ?
One more time .
Ahhhh , very good .
Brrrr . Now your lips should be coming alive .
Beautiful . You &apos;re getting really good at this .
And then , roll an R. Rrrrrrr .
That &apos;s like champagne for the tongue .
So you go , weeeaawww , weeeaawww .
Fantastic . Give yourselves a round of applause .
Now let me just put this in context to close .
This is a serious point here .
This is where we are now , right ?
I have talked about that on this stage in different phases .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Ge Wang : The DIY orchestra of the future
To which I usually respond , I do computer music .
Which is true .
So I &apos;ve connected myself into the speaker .
Let &apos;s do this every 200 milliseconds .
All right .
the canonical computer music .
So is this computer music ?
So these speakers are meant to emulate that .
This is an 11-inch Blanda Matt .
Add people , add laptops , you have a laptop orchestra .
And what might a laptop orchestra sound like ?
We can prototype instruments out of this . &quot;
So let me see if this will work .
And put it back .
This is a slightly metallic sound .
It &apos;s like a hovering car .
Thank you .
Thank you .
I &apos;m not sure why that would be .
Was that computer music ?
It is about people .
Naomi Oreskes : Why we should trust scientists
Scientists tell us that the world is warming .
Scientists tell us that vaccines are safe .
But how do we know if they are right ?
Why should be believe the science ?
So why should we believe the science ?
And faith is a separate thing apart and distinct from science .
Maybe a few hours on Sunday .
And so Pascal said , we &apos;d better believe in God .
He made that leap of faith leaving science and rationalism behind .
Most chemists are not experts in evolutionary theory .
Why do they believe each other &apos;s claims ?
And should we believe those claims ?
Can we observe them taking place in the natural world ?
Starlight actually does bend as it travels around the sun .
This was a huge confirmation of the theory .
So nomological means having to do with laws .
Why does it matter that it is a law of nature ?
And that relationship is true no matter what .
The main problem is that it &apos;s wrong .
So the first reason is a logical reason .
It &apos;s the problem of the fallacy of affirming the consequent .
Well , why ?
So that &apos;s one problem with the textbook model .
That difference , that angular difference , is the stellar parallax .
So this is a prediction that the Copernican model makes .
So what happened ?
And that turned out not to be true .
So , there &apos;s a third problem as well .
So he started collecting data .
And he collected many things , including his famous finches .
Besides inductive science , scientists also often participate in modeling .
And how do we do that ?
I don &apos;t know why he &apos;s got the Wellington boots .
Maybe it &apos;s going to rain .
So it was an argument about the cause of mountains .
But a computer simulation is a kind of a model .
So what , though , is driving that change ?
How can we know what &apos;s causing the observed warming ?
Well , scientists can model it using a computer simulation .
So here is the real life in black .
Scientists are creative .
And who judges ?
And in this sense , science is intrinsically conservative .
Scientists can say yes , something &apos;s true .
Scientists can say no , it &apos;s false .
That &apos;s what scientists call &quot; intractable . &quot;
It &apos;s the authority of the collective community .
Okay , so that brings me to my final point .
Most of us get up in the morning .
Most of us trust our cars .
The modern automobile hardly ever breaks down .
So why is that ? Why do cars work so well ?
Thank you very much .
So passwords are something that I hear a lot about .
It &apos;s tough .
And I said , &quot; Well , you know what ?
They didn &apos;t ask me . &quot;
No , we just asked them about their password .
How long is it ? Does it have a digit ?
Does it have a symbol ?
So we wanted to find some better source of data .
So a dumb attacker will try every password in order .
In fact , some of you probably have these passwords .
So we need to do more than just say long passwords .
Here are some examples .
So this was pretty fun .
What we found was that password meters do work .
He says , in fact , you &apos;ve already remembered it .
&quot; Oh , have you seen it ? That xkcd .
Correct horse battery staple . &quot;
So we tried a few different conditions .
That comes up with something that &apos;s sort of sentence-like .
And then we decided to try something called a pronounceable password .
That one kind of rolls off your tongue .
So these were random passwords that were generated by our computer .
So it &apos;s not really a clear win for pass phrases .
Sorry , all of you xkcd fans .
They audited our code .
They ran the code .
And so we never actually saw anybody &apos;s password .
We have lots of other really interesting demographic information as well .
So that was good news .
It &apos;s called &quot; Security Blanket . &quot;
So here are some examples of the difficulty .
So &quot; justin . &quot;
Maybe they &apos;re a Justin Bieber fan .
Or &quot; princess . &quot;
Is that a nickname ?
Are they Disney princess fans ?
Or maybe that &apos;s the name of their cat .
&quot; Iloveyou &quot; appears many times in many different languages .
There &apos;s a lot of love in these passwords .
And that guy is really cute .
Thank you .
Anne Curzan : What makes a word &quot; real &quot; ?
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll hear every mistake I make . &quot;
Those are the questions I want to talk about today .
I do not write dictionaries .
With that , let &apos;s turn to dictionaries .
Okay , so that looks like most of you .
Okay , many fewer .
I &apos;m actually fascinated by this .
Anyone who comes can vote .
Will all of these words stick ? Absolutely not .
We &apos;re noticing words that are coming into prominence .
It &apos;s really a question of attitude .
In response , the American Heritage Dictionaries include usage notes .
American Heritage has that as the first definition .
And what should I do with their pronouncements ? &quot;
But who looks at the front matter of dictionaries ?
There are about 200 people on the Usage Panel .
They include academicians , journalists , creative writers .
As of 2005 , the list includes me .
Here &apos;s what we can do for you .
That is and should be the extent of our authority .
We are not a language academy .
Now here &apos;s what I do to fill out the ballot .
I listen to what other people are saying and writing .
Does the language have to change that way ? &quot;
Well , you know what ?
Language just doesn &apos;t work that way .
So how does a word get into a dictionary ?
Thank you .
Now I did not know what to make of this .
I also thought , 80,000 relatives , do I want that ?
But another part of me said , this is remarkable .
It &apos;s in all seven continents , including Antarctica .
Here &apos;s my cousin Gwyneth Paltrow .
We have just 17 links between us .
And there &apos;s my cousin Barack Obama .
But does it really matter ?
What &apos;s the importance ?
First , it &apos;s got scientific value .
Number two , it brings history alive .
Also , it &apos;s not all good news .
So I want to make that clear . Sorry , honey .
Number three , interconnectedness .
We all have a bit of their DNA in us .
Now , it &apos;s not just ancestors we share , descendants .
Number four , a kinder world .
Now , I know that there are family feuds .
I have three sons , so I see how they fight .
We &apos;re not just part of the same species .
We &apos;re part of the same family .
We share 99.9 percent of our DNA .
Now the final one is number five , a democratizing effect .
I thought , what can I do with this information ?
So that &apos;s what I &apos;m doing .
And you &apos;re all invited .
Thank you . I want you there .
I want you there .
There &apos;s going to be exhibits and food , music .
He hasn &apos;t RSVP &apos;d yet , but fingers crossed .
He was a former member of the Obama administration .
Only together can we solve these big problems .
Goodbye .
In the middle of my Ph.D. , I was hopelessly stuck .
Every research direction that I tried led to a dead end .
It seemed like my basic assumptions just stopped working .
I stopped shaving .
I couldn &apos;t get out of bed in the morning .
And so obviously , I couldn &apos;t be a scientist .
I got stuck and I made it through .
And I started thinking , maybe there &apos;s a pattern here .
You &apos;re going to fail miserably .
You &apos;re going to get stuck .
And we would practice staying creative inside that stuck place .
That &apos;s why your schemas had better match reality .
Here &apos;s an example where things don &apos;t match your schema .
So I teach my students a different schema .
And I call this place the cloud .
It &apos;s dead , and everybody feels frustrated .
That &apos;s called blocking .
Saying &quot; Yes , and &quot; sounds like this .
It &apos;s pulling us to the moon ! &quot;
So saying &quot; Yes , and &quot; bypasses our inner critic .
We talk about the results .
So there was no way to talk about it in conferences .
That was unthinkable .
I thought , that &apos;s the way it is .
You see , science seeks knowledge that &apos;s objective and rational .
That &apos;s the beautiful thing about science .
I was in the cloud .
We call it being scooped , and being scooped feels horrible .
Thank you for your backup singing .
It feels like a huge taboo has been lifted .
Finally , we can talk about this in a scientific conference .
Thank you .
Will Potter : The shocking move to criminalize nonviolent protest
Police took this blurry photo of me holding leaflets as evidence .
The rest were outside at a new memorial .
But apparently , even exposing stuff like that is a threat .
They even included this nice little write-up of my book .
They described it as &quot; compelling and well-written . &quot;
Blurb on the next book , right ?
Our best weapon is sunlight .
It &apos;s time we strike a new note .
Thank you .
Keren Elazari : Hackers : the Internet &apos;s immune system
I &apos;m here today because I think we actually need hackers .
And I feel the same way .
That &apos;s why I &apos;m here today .
They scare us .
In true TED fashion , here is my most embarrassing picture .
Open Sesame .
This is the rush of power that hackers feel .
What would you do then ?
But they didn &apos;t steal anything .
Here &apos;s what you should do to fix it .
We hope we helped .
This is what Khalil did .
But I think there &apos;s a greater story here still .
These are things that will come back and bite you .
Since then , they &apos;ve gone after many targets .
They &apos;ve uncovered corruption , abuse .
It &apos;s not your documents . It &apos;s your attention .
They can bring people together .
They are now shaping the world &apos;s stage .
Hackers represent an exceptional force for change in the 21st century .
Two years ago , I saw General Keith Alexander .
I think he saw untapped potential .
In fact , he was there to give a hiring pitch .
To me , that represents hope .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Hack the planet !
They can perform gymnastic maneuvers like no robot we have yet .
This is the foot of a cockroach .
They can run up mesh without their feet .
Here &apos;s one moving with two middle legs gone .
Robust systems are also damage resistant .
Here &apos;s an animal climbing up a wall .
Here &apos;s what they do .
extraordinary exoskeletons .
Here &apos;s a dissection of an abdomen of a cockroach .
You see these plates , and you see the compliant membrane .
And you can do that now in less than 15 minutes .
They even have some of the beginnings where they disappear .
Now we want to know why they can go anywhere .
Dan Gilbert : The psychology of your future self
On and on and on .
Is it teenage years ? Is it middle age ?
Let me give you some data to back up that claim .
Here &apos;s three values .
So how does it do so ?
Well , we asked thousands of people .
Here &apos;s what we found .
We call this the &quot; end of history &quot; illusion .
For example , personality .
And it isn &apos;t just ephemeral things like values and personality .
People can name these things .
Does any of this matter ?
It bedevils our decision-making in important ways .
I put mine up on the screen to help you along .
The bottom line is , time is a powerful force .
It transforms our preferences .
It reshapes our values .
It alters our personalities .
We seem to appreciate this fact , but only in retrospect .
It &apos;s a watershed on the timeline .
It &apos;s the moment at which we finally become ourselves .
The one constant in our life is change .
Thank you .
Kitra Cahana : A glimpse of life on the road
No one loses their inner demons by taking to the road .
Thank you .
We make those choices all our lives .
I survived that childhood through a mix of avoidance and endurance .
And I said , &quot; Pity ? &quot;
Forge meaning , build identity , forge meaning and build identity .
That became my mantra .
Forging meaning is about changing yourself .
Building identity is about changing the world .
It only makes what was wrong precious .
Ease makes less of an impression on us than struggle .
And that &apos;s what they did .
It took identity to rescue me from sadness .
Identity politics can be narcissistic .
People extol a difference only because it &apos;s theirs .
So who can forge meaning and build identity ?
And yet , every step forward is so sweet .
Perhaps I could .
And everyone turned around , startled .
I &apos;m glad we all get cake .
And I thought — Thank you .
Forge meaning . Build identity .
Forge meaning .
Build identity .
And then invite the world to share your joy .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
Simon Sinek : Why good leaders make you feel safe
We have it backwards . Right ?
And my initial conclusion was that they &apos;re just better people .
But that &apos;s completely wrong .
Why did you do it ? &quot;
It &apos;s this deep sense of trust and cooperation .
So trust and cooperation are really important here .
It &apos;s not how it works . It &apos;s a feeling .
So where does that feeling come from ?
Nothing personal .
There are inherent benefits to this .
Bad system of survival .
The modern day is exactly the same thing .
We have no control over these forces .
These are a constant , and they &apos;re not going away .
So I said something .
Why can &apos;t you treat us like human beings ? &quot;
And this is exactly what she said to me .
It &apos;s because they don &apos;t fear their leaders .
Great leaders want exactly the same thing .
We would never do it .
Then why do we consider laying off people inside our organization ?
Charlie implemented a policy of lifetime employment .
It &apos;s not the numbers .
It &apos;s that they have violated the very definition of leadership .
This is what so offends us , not the numbers .
How about a $ 250 million bonus to Mother Teresa ?
Do we have an issue with that ? None at all .
None at all .
Great leaders would never sacrifice the people to save the numbers .
They would sooner sacrifice the numbers to save the people .
And Bob refused .
You see , Bob doesn &apos;t believe in head counts .
And so they came up with a furlough program .
Leadership is a choice . It is not a rank .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you .
Rives : The Museum of Four in the Morning
She &apos;s a Polish poet .
&quot; The hour from night to day .
The hour from side to side .
The hour for those past thirty ... &quot;
Had I shared an elevator ride with this poem ?
Did I flirt with this poem in a coffee shop somewhere ?
We didn &apos;t get home till around four in the morning .
Obviously , the demigods of coincidence were just messing with me .
That &apos;s how we did it in the pre-TED.com days .
It was fun . That was pretty much it .
A bunch of people sent me this when it came out .
I was surprised at the TEDster / &quot; Rugrats &quot; overlap .
More than one person sent me this .
Didi Pickles : It &apos;s four o &apos;clock in the morning .
Why on Earth are you making chocolate pudding ?
Stu Pickles : Because I &apos;ve lost control of my life .
Ronnie : Not at four o &apos;clock in the morning .
Those were all really solid examples .
But they followed the pattern . They played along .
I don &apos;t know anybody with juvenile diabetes .
People sent me magazine ads .
They took photographs in grocery stores .
I got a ton of graphic novels and comics .
Take a look .
Wilma Flintstone : Like how early ?
A thousand years from now , people are still doing this .
: The time is 4 a.m.
Rives : It shows the spectrum .
Here &apos;s your sampler .
Secondly , I did a little research .
You know , I was kind of interested .
Literature probably shows it best .
There are a couple three in the mornings in Shakespeare .
There &apos;s a five in the morning .
&quot; Lolita &quot; has as a creepy four in the morning .
&quot; Huckleberry Finn &quot; has one in dialect .
Someone sent in H.G. Wells &apos; &quot; The Invisible Man . &quot;
Someone else sent in Ralph Ellison &apos;s &quot; Invisible Man . &quot;
What kind of person would do that ?
This kind of person would do that .
But of course , there is no news yet .
Everyone &apos;s still asleep in their comfy , comfy beds .
Rives : Exactly .
And when I got to that point , I embraced it .
I started archiving .
Why &quot; Porn Star : Legend of Ron Jeremy &quot; ?
Because someone told me I would find this clip in there .
You can click on that red &quot; refresh &quot; button .
Rives : So the first hour of this project was satisfying .
I received a poignant tweet .
It was brief .
The name was a pseudonym , actually , or a pseudo-pseudonym .
L.D. was my college romance .
She was a grad student in the library sciences department .
But her mix tape did not get away .
I did this again last October .
And then I thought , &quot; Good for him . &quot;
&quot; PG &quot; is Slavic literature .
&quot; 7000 &quot; series Polish literature .
Z9A24 is a collection of 70 poems .
Tristram Wyatt : The smelly mystery of the human pheromone
&quot; Pheromone &quot; is a very powerful word .
They &apos;ve got lots of syllables .
It &apos;s things like androstenol , androstenone or androstadienone .
But sadly , these are fraudulent claims supported by dodgy science .
We &apos;re mammals . We produce a lot of smell .
You couldn &apos;t demonstrate it was chemical .
He analyzed it very carefully .
That &apos;s closing the circle .
It works just as well underwater for goldfish and lobsters .
What about humans ?
What &apos;s changed ? And of course , it &apos;s puberty .
There are , indeed , problems .
And the first of these is perhaps surprising .
It &apos;s all about culture .
It &apos;s ripe blue Stilton .
Liking it is incomprehensible to people from other countries .
Every culture has its own special food and national delicacy .
You &apos;re part of the in-group .
The second thing is the sense of smell .
We don &apos;t just have one kind of receptor .
So it doesn &apos;t apply to 20 percent of the world .
I &apos;m fairly convinced that we do have them .
There is one team that I &apos;m actually very impressed by .
They &apos;ve turned their attention now to human babies and mothers .
It &apos;s a very interesting secretion .
The baby remains sleeping , showing no interest at all .
It &apos;s not about individual recognition .
Any mother will do .
You &apos;ll be dead .
There could be all sorts of medical interventions .
So do go forward and do search for more .
There &apos;s lots to find .
Thank you very much .
Randall Munroe : Comics that ask &quot; what if ? &quot;
So I did some calculations .
Can you do this one soon ?
So I decided to try to figure this out myself .
There are a few things that I looked at here .
I started with money .
So they go through a huge number of them .
You can also look at power .
How much room is that ?
How many server racks could you fit in there ?
And this is a lot of fun .
And there are some things I didn &apos;t look at .
That gives you an idea of where they have people .
And sometimes not .
Thank you .
Stanley McChrystal : The military case for sharing knowledge
It was security . It was protecting information .
But the question often came , who needed to know ?
But what we found is we had to change .
We had to change our culture about information .
We had to knock down walls . We had to share .
And I said , &quot; Well , can we declassify them ?
What if the enemy finds out ? &quot;
And he says , &quot; They &apos;re their personnel records . &quot;
Thank you .
Stanley McChrystal : I think that Rick said something very important .
We , most people , don &apos;t know all the facts .
I think there are two parts of this .
HW : Thank you so much . Thank you .
Marco Tempest : And for my next trick , a robot
Say hello to EDI .
Now he &apos;s asleep . Let &apos;s wake him up .
EDI , EDI .
These mechanical performers were popular throughout Europe .
Audiences marveled at the way they moved .
It comes from &quot; robota . &quot;
It means &quot; forced labor . &quot;
Marco Tempest : But these robots were not real .
They were not intelligent .
EDI is different .
EDI is real .
EDI : I am 176 centimeters tall .
MT : He weighs 300 pounds .
MT : We love robots .
It &apos;s one of the leitmotifs of science fiction .
That &apos;s not true of the robot .
Now , this goes both ways .
EDI : Wow !
MT : Robots cannot anticipate human actions .
Accidents are inevitable .
EDI : Ow ! That hurt .
Ready , EDI ? EDI : Uh , ready , Marco .
Abracadabra .
MT : Abracadabra ?
Come on , keep up .
MT : Magic creates the illusion of an impossible reality .
Technology can do the same .
Thank you , Isaac Asimov .
MT : We anthropomorphize our machines .
We give them a friendly face and a reassuring voice .
EDI : I am EDI .
I became operational at TED in March 2014 .
MT : We let them entertain us .
EDI : Marco , you &apos;re standing on my foot !
Thank you .
EDI : Thank you !
Mellody Hobson : Color blind or color brave ?
So it &apos;s 2006 .
My friend Harold Ford calls me .
You come with him . &quot;
Harold and I arrive in New York .
We are in our best suits .
We look like shiny new pennies .
She motions for us to follow her .
Just as this happens , my friend rushes in .
The blood drains from her face .
There are literally no words , right ?
You see , my mother was ruthlessly realistic .
I was seven . I did not understand .
I mean , why would anyone treat me differently ?
But she knew .
There is shock , followed by a long silence .
And so I decided to actually talk about race .
So that is a fact .
And I know how we got here .
I know how we got here .
There &apos;s no question about it .
I tell the uniform story because it happened .
And I think it also threatens to hold back businesses .
And I failed a lot .
We cannot afford to be color blind .
We have to be color brave .
He runs ESPN .
I think that &apos;s a part of the secret sauce .
The example that he gives is the smallpox epidemic .
And the smallpox vaccination is bovine-based because of that dairy farmer .
What can I do ?
And I &apos;m telling you , you can be color brave .
She was an unbelievable role model .
We take a stand . We show courage .
I &apos;m asking you to be bold .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thanks . Thanks .
Andrew Bastawrous : Get your next eye exam on a smartphone
There are 39 million people in the world who are blind .
The challenges were great .
Power was rarely available .
We &apos;d have to run our equipment from petrol power generators .
And the beauty is , anybody can do it .
And it costs just 500 dollars .
Here are people who are blind from a curable condition cataract .
This is something that has to happen .
The reality is everyone goes blind on their own .
So here we have the Peek Vision app .
We can see all parts of the retina .
But now we can . Thank you .
The Olympic motto is &quot; Citius , Altius , Fortius . &quot;
Faster , Higher , Stronger .
And athletes have fulfilled that motto rapidly .
So what &apos;s going on here ?
That &apos;s a lot in sprinter land .
Now close your eyes for a second and picture the race .
Bang ! The gun goes off .
An American sprinter jumps out to the front .
Usain Bolt starts to catch him .
That &apos;s the entire finish of the race .
You can open your eyes now .
That first beep was Usain Bolt .
That last beep was Jesse Owens .
Listen to it again .
Listen to it again .
Consider a longer event .
Nowadays , college kids do that every year .
On rare occasions , a high school kid does it .
Only 530 are left .
That was his idea of a performance-enhancing drug .
Take a look at the record for the 100-meter freestyle swim .
This final cliff , the introduction of full-body and low-friction swimsuits .
Throughout sports , technology has changed the face of performance .
Where does the record stand today ?
Essentially the entire improvement in this record was due to technology .
Still , technology isn &apos;t the only thing pushing athletes forward .
And this showed in athletes &apos; bodies .
And this happened throughout the sports world .
It accelerated the artificial selection for specialized bodies .
My arm span is exactly equal to my height .
Yours is probably very nearly so .
But not the average NBA player .
And the opposite is advantageous in running .
You want long legs and a short torso .
And this shows in athletes &apos; bodies today .
We think of Kenyans as being great marathoners .
Kenyans think of the Kalenjin tribe as being great marathoners .
That &apos;s a four-minute-and-58-second-per-mile pace .
Thirty-two Kalenjin men did that last October .
That &apos;s from a source population the size of metropolitan Atlanta .
Athletes have a different mindset than they once did .
There &apos;s no explosion there .
They &apos;re essentially jumping .
That &apos;s the power that &apos;s contained in the human body .
But normally we can &apos;t access nearly all of it .
Endurance and ultra-endurance sports serve as a great example .
Our primate cousins can &apos;t do that .
They have to run like this .
Have you ever looked at an ape &apos;s butt ?
They have no buns because they don &apos;t run upright .
Here &apos;s Kílian running up the Matterhorn .
With a sweatshirt there tied around his waist .
It &apos;s so steep he can &apos;t even run here .
He &apos;s pulling up on a rope .
Amazing .
Changing technology , changing genes , and a changing mindset .
Thank you very much .
Wendy Chung : Autism — what we know
&quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Why did my child develop autism ? &quot;
But autism is not a single condition .
He &apos;s actually quite remarkably gifted in mathematics .
He doesn &apos;t make eye contact .
Has that number been increasing dramatically over time ?
The next question everyone wonders is , what caused autism ?
And a common misconception is that vaccines cause autism .
So the question remains , what does cause autism ?
In fact , there &apos;s probably not one single answer .
Remarkably , though , it &apos;s not 100 percent .
So this provides some of the data that autism is genetic .
Well , how genetic is it ?
And let me pose something that might not be intuitive .
They fit together in a pathway .
But early diagnosis is a key for us .
This baby we know is going to be in the clear .
How are we going to intervene ?
It &apos;s probably going to be a combination of factors .
But that &apos;s not going to be the only answer .
Beyond just drugs , we &apos;re going to use educational strategies .
They learn in a different way .
Thank you .
Elizabeth Gilbert : Success , failure and the drive to keep creating
And I said , &quot; Yes , I did . &quot;
So that &apos;s who I am .
I failed at getting published for almost six years .
And that &apos;s how I pushed through it .
She had failed constantly .
I had succeeded beyond my wildest expectation .
We had nothing in common .
For me , that home has always been writing .
And you know what happened with that book ?
It bombed , and I was fine .
Thank you .
James Patten : The best computer interface ? Maybe ... your hands
This one &apos;s called &quot; The Chase . &quot;
So here &apos;s an example of what I mean .
And this is a mapping application for disaster response .
This is a video chat application .
One example of those is protein folding .
Maybe this is the computer of the future .
There &apos;s no touchscreen .
There &apos;s no technology visible at all .
Thank you .
Hamish Jolly : A shark-deterrent wetsuit
And when we do , the results will often surprise .
The incident of shark engagements on humans is escalating worldwide .
So what &apos;s going on here ?
on the doorstep here , with the Oceans Institute .
And we did three key things .
We did that genetically and we did that anatomically .
And here &apos;s an example of one of the first drawings .
And this one &apos;s configured to go with a surfboard .
So we knew that we had some really solid science here .
We can &apos;t put humans in the water .
It &apos;ll be an ongoing process .
It &apos;s subject to peer review and subject to publication .
We &apos;ll license others to do that .
And Eduardo .
Cheers , mate .
Cheers .
Thanks , gentlemen . So what have we done here ?
Thank you .
Sarah Lewis : Embrace the near win
I learned so much from her .
I remember asking her what she thought of those early works .
In that moment , my view of success and creativity changed .
This is a question I &apos;ve long asked myself .
For three hours this went on .
Mastery is not just the same as excellence , though .
Elizabeth Murray surprised me with her admission about her earlier paintings .
Mastery is in the reaching , not the arriving .
How many inventors and untold entrepreneurs live out this phenomenon ?
We thrive when we stay at our own leading edge .
It &apos;s called the Dunning – Kruger effect .
And this is what a near win does .
They &apos;re masters because they realize that there isn &apos;t one .
This is the dynamic of mastery .
Thank you .
The universe is teeming with planets .
We &apos;ve only detected them indirectly .
This is NASA &apos;s famous picture of the pale blue dot .
Why haven &apos;t we done that ? Why is that hard ?
Now let &apos;s move ten times further away .
Here we are at the orbit of Uranus .
Now it &apos;s not resolved at all .
It &apos;s that pale blue dot of Carl Sagan &apos;s .
But let &apos;s move yet again ten times further away .
One more time , ten times further away .
The light from the star is diffracting .
We have to get rid of it .
You &apos;ve all seen that . That &apos;s a solar eclipse .
The moon has moved in front of the sun .
Well , what &apos;s going on ?
Well the moon is casting a shadow down on the Earth .
Spitzer &apos;s suggestion was we do this in space .
Well that would look something like this .
But Spitzer actually knew the answer .
It looks something like that .
We call that our flower petal starshade .
It starts wrapped around a hub .
It separates from the telescope .
Boom , we get planets orbiting about it .
Thank you .
That &apos;s not science fiction .
So those are four petals .
This is a sub-scale star shade .
You &apos;ll see the petals unfurl .
Now you &apos;re seeing it deploy .
Those petals have to rotate into place .
I think this is the coolest possible science .
That will change everything when we see that .
Thank you .
Jennifer Senior : For parents , happiness is a very high bar
Thank you for indulging me .
I have always wanted to do that .
It sold almost 50 million copies by the time he died .
All of these books are well-intentioned .
I am sure that many of them are great .
I see anxiety .
Parents experience more stress than non-parents .
Their marital satisfaction is lower .
Who are on par with strangers . &quot;
But here &apos;s the thing .
Something about parenting right now at this moment is the problem .
Our roles as mothers and fathers have changed .
The roles of our children have changed .
So how did we get here ?
Kids were considered economic assets .
And thank God it did .
Once kids stopped working , the economics of parenting changed .
This was true even when I was young .
I ate jars of pureed macaroni and beef .
And you know what ? I &apos;m doing okay .
I pay my taxes .
I hold down a steady job .
I was even invited to speak at TED .
The writer Michael Lewis once put this very , very well .
Guess what it was ?
Dad in a room by himself .
But here is the thing : Men are doing plenty .
They are truly improvising as they go .
We are one of eight known countries that does not .
We are all the custodians of their self-esteem .
But it is a very elusive one .
It &apos;s not like teaching them how to ride a bike .
There &apos;s no curriculum for it .
Can I just repeat that ?
Bad modeling . I don &apos;t know .
I cannot tell you how much this distresses me .
The offending muppet , right there .
That &apos;s my son the day he was born .
I was high as a kite on morphine .
I had had an unexpected C-section .
I whispered it into his ear .
That , anyway , is one response to having no script .
Thank you .
Adam II is the humble side of our nature .
Adam I wants to conquer the world .
Adam II wants to hear a calling and obey the world .
Adam I savors accomplishment .
Adam II savors inner consistency and strength .
Adam I asks how things work .
Adam II asks why we &apos;re here .
Adam I &apos;s motto is &quot; success . &quot;
You have to give to receive .
You have to conquer the desire to get what you want .
In order to fulfill yourself , you have to forget yourself .
In order to find yourself , you have to lose yourself .
You don &apos;t have the depth of conviction .
You don &apos;t have an emotional sonorousness .
Adam I is built by building on your strengths .
Adam II is built by fighting your weaknesses .
You were both doing the work that you love .
People don &apos;t realize that .
I certainly didn &apos;t .
Gabby Giffords : Yes .
She didn &apos;t have much other information .
She just said , &quot; Gabby was shot . &quot;
GG : The new one -- better , stronger , tougher .
PM : And there were certain words , too .
Didn &apos;t she surprise you with words in the beginning ?
Yeah , that was it .
GG : Talking . Really hard . Really .
I do .
She works incredibly hard every day .
Yeah , Gabby , she used to race motorcycles .
So you meet .
What attracts you to Gabby ?
Gabby would — GG : Fact-finding mission .
She would call it an important fact-finding mission .
PM : Would you describe it as a whirlwind romance ?
GG : No , no , no .
A good friend .
Yeah , we were friends for a long time .
Where &apos;d we go , Gabby ?
GG : Death row .
So that was our first date .
We &apos;ve been together ever since . GG : Yes .
You were willing to go to death row , after all .
I guess .
I thought we always had a very special relationship .
Actually , you didn &apos;t even live together .
We had one of those commuter marriages .
What did you like best about being in Congress ?
GG : Fast pace . Fast pace .
Gabby &apos;s in a coma . I &apos;m in Tucson .
You &apos;ve got to find a replacement for me . &quot;
PM : Is that for appetizer or dessert , Mark ?
Well , it just gets the conversation going .
GG : The debt ceiling . The debt ceiling .
What &apos;s life like , day to day ?
Well , that &apos;s Gabby &apos;s service dog Nelson .
GG : Nelson .
New member of our family . GG : Yes , yes .
But she did a great job with this dog .
He &apos;s a fabulous service dog .
PM : Your relationship is deeper .
I imagine being grateful , too , right ?
GG : Grateful .
GG : I want to make the world a better place .
And Gabby , what &apos;s on the agenda now ?
GG : Americans for Responsible Solutions .
We &apos;re trying to change that .
We &apos;re gun owners , we support gun rights .
It &apos;s not too difficult to do that .
PM : Thank you both for that effort .
I have to share this video of your most recent adventure .
Take a look at Gabby .
This is a couple months ago .
Good stuff . Gorgeous . Oh , thank you .
Mountains . Gorgeous mountains .
He started doing better .
So they have a very , very nice connection .
GG : Yes .
PM : What a wonderful moment .
GG : Thank you .
Hello , everyone .
Thank you for inviting us here today .
But my spirit is strong as ever .
Get involved with your community .
Be a leader . Set an example .
Be passionate . Be courageous .
Be your best . Thank you very much .
Thank you . GG : Thank you .
Thank you everybody . GG : Bye bye .
David Sengeh : The sore problem of prosthetic limbs
It does not matter how powerful your prosthetic ankle is .
Thank you very much .
Hidden miracles of the natural world
What is the intersection between technology , art and science ?
We can do the same thing with ships at sea .
It can hover , fly backwards , even upside down .
This is the egg of a butterfly .
Can you guess what this is ?
Shark skin .
A caterpillar &apos;s mouth .
The eye of a fruit fly .
An eggshell .
A flea .
A snail &apos;s tongue .
The silk is 100 times thinner than human hair .
People go about their lives surrounded by the unseeable .
We &apos;ll just have to see .
Thank you .
Christopher Emdin : Teach teachers how to create magic
Right now .
And that to me is sad .
I &apos;m going to paraphrase Mark Twain .
Guess where those places are ?
And I &apos;ve been framing this idea called Pentecostal pedagogy .
Who here has been to a black church ?
We got a couple of hands .
So he says , &quot; Can I get an amen ? &quot;
Audience : Amen .
CE : And all of a sudden , everybody &apos;s reawoken .
That preacher bangs on the pulpit for attention .
Magic can be taught .
Magic can be taught .
Now , how do you teach it ?
They study the way that he walks proudly across that stage .
Thank you .
Amanda Burden : How public spaces make cities work
They think of buildings and streets and skyscrapers , noisy cabs .
But when I think about cities , I think about people .
They are what makes it come alive .
But what makes a public space work ?
And it was green .
Unfortunately , that &apos;s not how cities were being designed .
So here you see a familiar sight .
This is how plazas have been designed for generations .
They not only look desolate , they feel downright dangerous .
I mean , where would you sit here ?
What would you do here ?
But architects love them .
They are plinths for their creations .
And for developers , they are ideal .
But don &apos;t you think this is a waste ?
Now , open spaces in cities are opportunities .
So we came up with a radical , almost insane idea .
So you see , details really do make a difference .
Well , I didn &apos;t have any idea .
And what about cars ?
Our city couldn &apos;t possibly handle any more cars .
So what were we going to do ?
So here was the answer to our puzzle .
So how was I going to get this done ?
It &apos;s not something you can just fake .
And so I began walking .
You can &apos;t see zoning and you can &apos;t feel zoning .
My mission was always to create great public spaces .
Honestly , I had no idea how it would turn out .
I had to have faith .
And here is a new park in lower Manhattan .
And it did .
Lower Manhattan finally has a public waterfront on all three sides .
I really love this park .
So what &apos;s the trick ?
You don &apos;t tap into your design expertise .
You tap into your humanity .
I mean , would you want to go there ?
Would you want to stay there ?
Can you see into it and out of it ?
Are there other people there ?
Does it seem green and friendly ?
Can you find your very own seat ?
The High Line was an elevated railway .
You might see a beautiful park , but not everyone does .
Well , a developer sees just one thing : customers .
Well no , it would not be terrific .
It would be a mall , and not a park .
Perhaps it was just in their way .
I believe that a successful city is like a fabulous party .
People stay because they are having a great time .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Lawrence Lessig : The unstoppable walk to political reform
So a chip , a poet and a boy .
So there was a revolution across the world .
Number two , a poet .
This is Martin Niemöller .
You &apos;re familiar with his poetry .
Then they came for the socialists .
Then they came for the trade unions .
Then they came for the Jews .
And then they came for me .
But there was no one left to speak for me . &quot;
Now , Niemöller is offering a certain kind of insight .
This is an insight at the core of intelligence .
We could call it cluefulness .
Can you save yourself or save your kind ?
Turns out ants are pretty good at this .
Cows , not so much .
So can you see the pattern ?
Number three , a boy .
This is my friend Aaron Swartz .
He &apos;s Tim &apos;s friend .
So I was a little put off by this .
He wasn &apos;t sharing in my celebration .
He said , &quot; What about as a citizen ?
As a citizen . &quot;
Now , this is the way Aaron was .
He didn &apos;t tell . He asked questions .
But his questions spoke as clearly as my four-year-old &apos;s hug .
It is every time , every single important issue .
We &apos;ve got to end the bovinity of this political society .
I couldn &apos;t begin to describe the sadness .
Because I had to focus .
It saved me .
Hope .
I loved that boy like I love my son .
But we failed him .
I &apos;m not going to fail that .
What &apos;s next ?
And then finally number three , the hardest .
We &apos;re in the age of the Super PAC .
It is now an official word in the dictionary .
And the basic way this works is this .
What is that number ? Half a billion ? A billion ?
What is that number ?
So last night , we heard about wishes .
Here &apos;s my wish .
May one .
May one .
Aaron asked me that .
Now I &apos;ve asked you .
Thank you very much .
Facebook has 1.2 billion users per month .
So half the Earth &apos;s Internet population is using Facebook .
So this is Target , the company .
Yeah , the dad was really upset .
We can do all of this really well .
If you Google this , you &apos;ll find it .
It &apos;s four pages , easy to read .
We also know a lot about how information spreads through networks .
So this is something we &apos;ve studied for a long time .
We have good models of it .
So this is pretty complicated stuff , right ?
And I see that as a real problem going forward .
We totally can do that now .
That seems to me to be a problem .
so users control their data .
So that gives us an advantage over the law side .
Thank you .
So , this is an interview with a difference .
So , we &apos;re going to start here .
Melinda Gates : With those big glasses , huh ?
We were already engaged to be married .
We started asking ourselves questions .
Does it have to be like this ?
Were there things that weren &apos;t being done ?
There was a lot we didn &apos;t know .
So it started there , but it got accelerated .
How on Earth do you decide what to focus on ?
What &apos;s this about ?
and others supported .
How do you navigate that ?
Bill , this is your graph . What &apos;s this about ?
Well , my graph has numbers on it .
I really like this graph .
So this is a story largely of vaccines .
Smallpox was killing a couple million kids a year .
That was eradicated , so that got down to zero .
Measles was killing a couple million a year .
That &apos;s down to a few hundred thousand .
We can actually accelerate the progress .
It &apos;s not reported .
Does that drive you crazy ?
Yeah , because it &apos;s a silent thing going on .
It &apos;s a kid , one kid at a time .
These causes have been a bit invisible .
You should look at , what was your goal ?
We can spend aid smarter .
It is not all a panacea .
How have you guys managed it ?
That just wouldn &apos;t work out . &quot;
He &apos;s going to listen and be really interested .
That must have been hard , adjusting to that . No ?
I was actually really excited .
Yes , the foundation employees had angst about that .
That &apos;s cool .
Including some of the employees .
She &apos;s got a lot of insight .
She &apos;ll sit down with the employees a lot .
We &apos;ll take the different trips she described .
So there &apos;s a lot of collaboration .
MG : Well , here &apos;s the thing .
For me , I come at it from intuition .
What about failure , though ?
Well , we got hundreds of ideas .
Maybe a few of those will work out .
Are there any failures that you can talk about ?
They bring down the dropout rate .
They have less violence and crime in those schools .
MG : So we went to Tanzania .
Jenn &apos;s been to Tanzania .
Anna and Sanare are the parents .
They invited us to come and stay in their boma .
It was a very loving relationship .
She was very , very shy .
So she kept wanting to talk to me and Jenn .
We kept trying to engage her , but she was shy .
Oh , wow .
How have you managed it ?
What &apos;s been your approach ?
You &apos;ve obviously guarded their privacy carefully for obvious reasons .
MG : Well , it &apos;s interesting .
Is that your plan for them ?
Nope . No . They won &apos;t have anything like that .
How on Earth did that happen ?
We &apos;ve got time for the short version .
Half the resources we have come from Warren &apos;s mind-blowing generosity .
Yes .
How is that going ?
We &apos;re not trying to homogenize it .
I mean , the beauty of philanthropy is this mind-blowing diversity .
People give to some things .
We look and go , &quot; Wow . &quot;
But that &apos;s great .
We need more experimentation .
To me , that &apos;s the piece that &apos;s incredible .
I &apos;m curious , can you make the pitch ?
What &apos;s the pitch ?
Is that a fair comment ?
It tries to balance out , and that &apos;s just .
MG : But you change systems .
That , to me , really changes the inequality balance .
That &apos;s the most important .
Thank you . MG : Thank you .
Thank you . MG : Thank you very much .
All right , good job .
Allan Adams : The discovery that could rewrite physics
It &apos;s now 2.7 degrees .
But it &apos;s not exactly 2.7 degrees .
What happens ? It rings .
Those waves have long since faded .
If you go for a walk , you don &apos;t wiggle .
And on Monday , they announced that they had found it .
And that amazes me .
Thanks a lot .
TED staff : It &apos;s TED , the Musical
Daffodil Hudson : Hello ?
Yeah , this is she .
What ?
What are the dates again ?
Pen . Pen . Pen .
March 17 through 21 .
Okay , all right , great . Thanks .
Lab Partner : Who was that ?
DH : It was TED .
LP : Who &apos;s TED ?
DH : I &apos;ve got to prepare .
Can I help you ?
DH : Right now ?
Stagehand : Break a leg .
Del Harvey : Protecting Twitter users
Let &apos;s talk about what scale looks like at Twitter .
We were seeing two million tweets in less than six minutes .
That &apos;s a 24,900-percent increase .
There &apos;s no risk involved .
My job is to root out and prevent activity that might .
Sounds straightforward , right ?
Say 99.999 percent of tweets pose no risk to anyone .
There &apos;s no threat involved .
You know what else makes my role particularly challenging ?
People do weird things .
We &apos;ll start off easy .
Let &apos;s look at spam .
Seems pretty straightforward .
Turns out there &apos;s some exceptions to that rule .
Okay . Let &apos;s make the stakes higher .
Back to my account , again exhibiting classic behavior .
This time it &apos;s sending the same message and link .
That &apos;s pretty clearly not a good thing .
So why are the stakes higher for this ?
So what do I do ?
I visualize catastrophe .
What do I mean by &quot; visualize catastrophe ? &quot;
Which happens to be my next example .
This is my cat , Eli .
You only get 140 characters .
My job isn &apos;t to think of those .
It &apos;s to think of what could go wrong .
How could this picture lead to my death ?
Well , here &apos;s one possibility .
There &apos;s more in that picture than just a cat .
There &apos;s geodata .
It &apos;s not .
Thank you .
Ed Yong : Zombie roaches and other parasite tales
But why do these groups form ?
And that is often not the case .
This is Artemia , a brine shrimp .
You probably know it better as a sea monkey .
These shrimp are infected with a tapeworm .
As a freelance journalist , I sympathize .
The shrimp are just one step on its journey .
Its ultimate destination is this , the greater flamingo .
It &apos;s not safety in numbers .
It &apos;s actually the exact opposite .
And here is another example of a parasitic manipulation .
This is a suicidal cricket .
Crickets are really roomy . Who knew ?
The tapeworm and the Gordian worm are not alone .
And I &apos;ve been writing about these creatures ever since .
Few topics in biology enthrall me more .
It &apos;s like the parasites have subverted my own brain .
But there &apos;s more to it than that .
Parasites invite us to resist the allure of obvious stories .
Their world is one of plot twists and unexpected explanations .
Is it maybe protecting its siblings ?
No .
See what I mean ?
Now , the caterpillar didn &apos;t die .
Manipulation is not an oddity .
And this is one of my favorite examples .
This discovery came out three weeks ago .
These hosts won &apos;t get to survive or reproduce .
Now humans , of course , are no stranger to manipulation .
The cat eats the rat . Toxo gets to have sex .
It &apos;s a classic tale of Eat , Prey , Love .
You &apos;re very charitable , generous people .
Hi , Elizabeth , I loved your talk .
How does the parasite control its host in this way ?
We don &apos;t really know .
But how those puzzle pieces fit together is not immediately clear .
What is clear is that this thing is a single cell .
This has no nervous system . It has no consciousness .
It doesn &apos;t even have a body .
But it &apos;s manipulating a mammal ?
We are mammals .
Now typically , this doesn &apos;t lead to any overt illness .
subvert our way of thinking about the world makes parasites amazing .
But perhaps , that &apos;s just a parasite talking .
Thank you .
Good morning .
In our home , art was everywhere .
It was like oxygen , around us and necessary for life .
I found these objects both useful and fascinating .
I did this for hours every day , apparently avoiding electrocution .
Life was good .
But I wondered , what about when it rained ?
But the ceiling was amazing .
It looked like a Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome .
I loved this place .
He said , &quot; About 2,000 years ago . &quot;
He said , &quot; It &apos;s the original roof . &quot;
To build the Pantheon took some miracles .
For example , here are some of the Pantheon &apos;s miracles .
I discovered for the first time that light itself has substance .
Someone themselves , perhaps Hadrian , needed a brilliant creative vision .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the quota .
Take the oculus of the Pantheon .
Not bad .
Enough ancient history .
So what came after the moon ?
The Internet isn &apos;t a Pantheon .
The smartphone is a perfect example .
So what &apos;s next ?
What imminent advance will be the equivalent of the Pantheon ?
It is a different kind of language , like art .
So what is next ?
Now you &apos;re thinking , give me a break .
How can a fancy version of cruise control be profound ?
Automotive energy consumption and air pollution will be cut dramatically .
But why now ? Why do we think this is ready ?
So what are the five miracles needed for autonomous vehicles ?
This will start with the HOV lanes and move from there .
Occasionally , humans will need to do sense-making .
But these people don &apos;t spontaneously pop into existence .
We need to love them and help them discover their passions .
They are in fact essential to what makes us special .
Thank you .
The problem is anonymous companies .
So , why am I here talking to all of you ?
But why does the Earth go around the sun ?
But why is blood red ?
But why do I have to go to school ?
But why do I have to respect the teachers and authority ?
And we had talked about that many , many times before .
So , what exactly does Global Witness do ?
And then we campaign hard to change the system itself .
And one of these is anonymous companies .
That &apos;s twice the country &apos;s health and education budget combined .
Well , that uses anonymous companies too .
Now anonymous companies are great for sanctions busting too .
And really , that is unfair .
Well , the answer is , yes you can .
And then you add the owner of the company .
It could be another company .
Well , that &apos;s no problem either .
You can simply keep adding layers , companies owned by companies .
But whose interests is this all serving ?
And what does it all mean for us ?
It was the night before New Year &apos;s Eve .
Over 200 people died .
Seven hundred were injured trying to get out .
Why should this secrecy be such an accepted business practice ?
And so I come to my wish .
So what might this look like ?
Imagine what a game changer that would be .
So how are we going to do this ?
Well , there is only one way .
There is such an opportunity right now .
You really can make this change happen .
It &apos;s going to be a springboard for our global campaigning .
That is momentum .
But it &apos;s early days .
This isn &apos;t just a dry policy issue .
This is a human issue which affects us all .
This is about being on the right side of history .
Together , let &apos;s kickstart this global movement .
Let &apos;s just do it , let &apos;s end anonymous companies .
Thank you .
Chris Hadfield : What I learned from going blind in space
What &apos;s the scariest thing you &apos;ve ever done ?
And why did you do it ?
It feels like someone &apos;s pouring cement on you or something .
And we &apos;re alive .
It &apos;s an amazing experience .
But why would we take that risk ?
Why would you do something that dangerous ?
In my case the answer is fairly straightforward .
How do you deal with fear versus danger ?
I was thinking , what do I do next ?
But unfortunately , without gravity , tears don &apos;t fall .
So what &apos;s the scariest thing you &apos;ve ever done ?
Maybe it &apos;s spiders .
A lot of people are afraid of spiders .
And how do you know ?
I don &apos;t know . Are there brown recluses here ?
The danger is entirely different than the fear .
How do you get around it , though ?
How do you change your behavior ?
And then you see another spiderweb and walk into that one .
And you can apply this to anything .
It would make you nervous and worried .
He could come over and help me . &quot;
I could find my own way back .
It &apos;s not nearly as big a deal .
What is the real thing that you should be afraid of ?
Not just a generic fear of bad things happening .
You see a beauty that otherwise never would have happened .
It &apos;s time to come home at the end .
This is our spaceship , the Soyuz , that little one .
Just to finish , they asked me to play that guitar .
That &apos;s very nice of you . Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Carin Bondar : The birds and the bees are just the beginning
Anyone in the room thought about sex today ?
Yeah , you did .
Thank you for putting your hand up over there .
Penile diversity is especially profuse .
So this is a paper nautilus .
Just what is a hectocotylus ?
A detachable , swimming penis .
Now , the tapir is a mammal from South America .
And the tapir has a prehensile penis .
And these contributions are far from equal .
And quite frankly , that &apos;s exactly what it is .
From flaccid to ejaculation in less than a second .
There are some more primitive ways of pleasing one &apos;s partner .
Why do they do this ?
Mm-hm .
A little guppy porn for you right there .
I mean , imagine putting a penis into another penis .
So what are my take-home messages from my talk today ?
So thank you , and happy daydreaming .
Anne-Marie Slaughter : Can we all &quot; have it all &quot; ?
So my moment of truth did not come all at once .
The woman I thought I was would have said yes .
That was a decision based on love and responsibility .
But the real change came more gradually .
The best companies actually know this .
Siesta is not just about avoiding the heat of the day .
But consider a same-sex couple like my friends Sarah and Emily .
They &apos;re psychiatrists .
And what criteria should they use to make that decision ?
Or who has the most flexible boss ?
The feminist revolution still has a long way to go .
It &apos;s certainly not complete .
And as many women hold that view as men do .
For a man , that &apos;s a risky proposition .
We should be socializing them to make caregiving cool for guys .
But in fact , the change is actually already happening .
They are in the birthing rooms .
They take paternity leave when they can .
That was completely unthinkable 50 or even 30 years ago .
Bill Gates agrees .
Let &apos;s bring them both together .
Let &apos;s make the feminist revolution a humanist revolution .
Today , not so much .
The revolution for human equality can happen .
It is happening .
It will happen .
How far and how fast is up to us .
Thank you .
Ajit Narayanan : A word game to communicate in any language
I work with children with autism .
Specifically , I make technologies to help them communicate .
Let me tell you a little bit about why this is .
Now , this was very effective .
Let me explain this in a little more detail .
Take this sentence : &quot; I want soup tonight . &quot;
Now , this is what we call grammar .
in order to convey anything you want to .
The solution came to me from a very interesting perspective .
You want to eat ? Somebody else wants to eat ?
It &apos;s what comes after thought but before language .
And I found that this is not enough .
Why is this not enough ?
You do that by changing the word &quot; want . &quot;
It &apos;s a past tense .
It &apos;s a fairly complicated sentence .
I &apos;m going to start with the word &quot; tell . &quot;
So this is the word &quot; tell . &quot;
I &apos;m going to ask questions .
So , who told ? I told .
I told whom ? I told the carpenter .
Couldn &apos;t pay whom ? I couldn &apos;t pay the carpenter .
I told the carpenter I could not pay him .
And there are two or three interesting things about this .
First of all , I could have started anywhere .
I was trying out so many different combinations of this .
And then I noticed something very interesting about FreeSpeech .
And so this gave me this idea .
And so I tried a number of experiments .
All right , let &apos;s talk about something else .
Let &apos;s talk about speech .
Now what &apos;s interesting about speech is that speech is one-dimensional .
It &apos;s also one-dimensional because our mouths are built that way .
Our mouths are built to create one-dimensional sound .
Take Google , for example .
What if we could do this in FreeSpeech instead ?
Instead they &apos;re processing the data structure of thought .
The data structure of thought .
That &apos;s a provocative idea .
But let &apos;s look at this in a little more detail .
So this is the FreeSpeech ecosystem .
FreeSpeech , I told you , is completely language-independent .
That &apos;s a pretty interesting concept in itself .
You &apos;ve encoded an entire human language into a software program .
it &apos;s actually not very complicated .
And that gives this interesting idea .
And that gives another interesting idea .
We have so many different languages .
That means &quot; ever-smiling speaker of beautiful languages . &quot;
Language is beautiful .
I think it &apos;s the most beautiful of human creations .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Here are some images of clusters of galaxies .
They &apos;re exactly what they sound like .
Useful as the universe &apos;s most massive laboratories .
So , how big ?
Well , here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster .
It &apos;s just mind-boggling how massive these systems can get .
But more than their mass , they have this additional feature .
might be answered by studying these systems .
So that was very big .
The second things is very hot .
This is in false color .
It &apos;s actually X-ray light that we &apos;re seeing .
Third thing : probing the very small .
You were lied to .
And dark matter is no exception .
Well , how do we do this ?
Here is an image .
So , it &apos;s very funny .
Fourth thing : the physics of the very strange .
Certainly what I &apos;ve said so far is crazy .
Similarly , cosmologists understand why the universe is expanding .
And , again , we want to learn more about it .
Here is a computer simulation .
And we need a way to simplify it .
Well , I like to think about this using an analogy .
And the solutions to these problems are not obvious .
They are not faster horses .
They will require an enormous amount of scientific ingenuity .
Christopher Ryan : Are we designed to be sexual omnivores ?
Okay . Pretty much everybody .
I see one guy there .
It doesn &apos;t count if it was you , sir .
So his hand &apos;s down . And one woman . Okay .
Sitting next to a loud guy .
Now what does this tell us ?
This is known as female copulatory vocalization to the clipboard crowd .
So I thought , got to talk about that .
We &apos;ll get back to that a little bit later .
Now this sets men and women up in an oppositional relationship .
And there &apos;s really no argument about this among anthropologists .
There were no strangers . Right ?
In a hunter-gatherer band , there are no strangers .
But I &apos;m not saying they were having sex with strangers .
And I &apos;m not saying there was no pair-bonding going on .
I &apos;m just saying it wasn &apos;t sexually exclusive .
Okay ? So this is my point .
That one took a minute to sink in , huh ?
This is vanishingly rare among mammals .
So it &apos;s a very interesting aspect of human sexuality .
So what we &apos;re talking about is sperm competition .
There &apos;s a lot to talk about in this chart .
That indicates female copulatory vocalization .
Just look at the numbers .
The average human has sex about 1,000 times per birth .
We share that ratio with chimps and bonobos .
That &apos;s what the external testicles are .
I &apos;m sorry . It &apos;s true .
Now , this evidence goes way beyond anatomy .
It goes into anthropology as well .
These women are the Mosuo from southwestern China .
There &apos;s no shame associated with sexual behavior .
Women have hundreds of partners .
The biological father is a nonissue .
Now , why does this matter ?
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you . Christopher Ryan : Thank you .
So a question .
How is that different from the talk you gave ?
But that &apos;s just an example .
Everyone has to respond to the modern world .
But the body does have its inherent evolved trajectories .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m trying to get at .
Thank you . Communicated powerfully . Thanks a lot .
CR : Thank you , Chris .
Molly Stevens : A new way to grow bone
Take , for example , this beautiful blue nacre shell .
We &apos;re not quite sure why they did it .
It &apos;s hard . It &apos;s durable .
But it also had other very nice properties .
They &apos;ve taken things off the shelf .
Their very purpose was to perform a mechanical function .
We have cells there , typically from the patient .
And bone is actually quite good at repairing .
And I &apos;ll talk you through this .
That layer is called the periosteum .
We &apos;ve lots of blood vessels in there .
But there &apos;s a difference here .
Thank you .
Rupal Patel : Synthetic voices , as unique as fingerprints
That &apos;s what I &apos;d like to share with you .
Rupal Patel : That was the voice of Professor Stephen Hawking .
So why then the same prosthetic voice ?
I want you to take a listen to how they sound .
They &apos;re saying the same utterance .
So I reached out to my collaborator , Tim Bunnell .
These are people who had lost their voice later in life .
So we decided to do exactly that .
Children sound different from teens who sound different from adults .
We &apos;ve all experienced this .
And that happens in one individual .
It &apos;s that simple .
That &apos;s the science behind what we &apos;re doing .
It &apos;s not such an ominous thing .
The process goes something like this .
Voice : Things happen in pairs .
I love to sleep .
The sky is blue without clouds .
We &apos;re going to call this database a voice bank .
Voice : I love chocolate .
RP : So that &apos;s speech synthesis .
That &apos;s not the novel part .
This is Samantha .
She calls it mixing colors to paint voices .
It &apos;s beautiful . It &apos;s exactly that .
Samantha : Aaaaaah .
RP : So now , Samantha can say this .
Samantha : This voice is only for me .
But there &apos;s so much more work to be done .
They say that giving blood can save lives .
Well , giving your voice can change lives .
So that &apos;s the science behind what we &apos;re doing .
And then I saw William typing a message on his device .
I wondered , what was he thinking ?
Imagine that .
Thank you .
Chris McKnett : The investment logic for sustainability
Let me remind you what we already know .
See , I told you this is the really juicy stuff .
Well , the really cool thing is that most CEOs are .
So the views of CEOs are clear .
There &apos;s tremendous opportunity in sustainability .
One example is near and dear to our hearts .
That &apos;s the equivalent of taking 21,000 cars off the road .
So awesome , right ?
Another example is Pentair .
I mean , come on , really ?
Do companies that take sustainability into account really do well financially ?
The answer that may surprise you is yes .
In blue , we see the MSCI World .
Over three plus years , no performance tradeoff .
In some cases , there may be outperformance from ESG .
So yes , this is correlation . It &apos;s not causation .
Hesta .
You gotta love the Aussies , right ?
CalPERS is another example .
and the sixth largest in the world .
This is why we are concerned with ESG . &quot;
I mean , let me clarify something right here .
They &apos;re compatible .
So I &apos;m not talking about tradeoffs here .
But institutional investors are the x-factor in sustainability .
Why do they hold the key ?
A lot of it .
I mean , a really lot of it .
The global stock market is worth 55 trillion dollars .
The global bond market , 78 trillion .
That &apos;s 133 trillion combined .
That &apos;s eight and a half times the GDP of the U.S.
That &apos;s the world &apos;s largest economy .
That &apos;s some serious freaking firepower .
What if there isn &apos;t enough clean air and fresh water ?
So by investing sustainably we &apos;re doing two things .
I bet you can &apos;t guess which side I &apos;m on .
Thank you .
Aparna Rao : Art that craves your attention
So the first work is called the Imperial Monochromes .
So this is the sketch of the two states .
One is total chaos . The other is absolute order .
This also reminded us of two very different pictorial traditions .
So I &apos;m just going to take you to a video .
So here I &apos;m going to show you two tandem clips .
So here &apos;s a video .
The next work is Decoy .
So here is the first test scenario .
So this is the final fabricated body of the Decoy .
Seated in this audience are 996 small figures .
They &apos;re mechanically enabled to clap of their own free will .
It also has an alluring and trap-like quality to it .
And here is a prototype .
It comes out of the idea of a window .
This grid is inhabited by a tribe of small figures .
So to us , this work also presents its own contradiction .
So it &apos;s really quite small .
Thank you .
Teddy Cruz : How architectural innovations migrate across borders
What do I mean by the informal in this case ?
So these are houses waiting to cross the border .
This layering of spaces and economies is very interesting to notice .
I don &apos;t want to romanticize poverty .
With shovels in hand , they started to dig .
Two weeks later , the police stopped them .
With this knowledge , these teenagers as skaters confronted the city .
They came to the city attorney &apos;s office .
Thank you .
Server : May I help you , sir ?
Customer : Uh , let &apos;s see .
Server : Would you like any desserts , sir ?
Our special is tracking cookie .
Server : Coming right up , sir .
Your food will be served shortly .
Animation and art has always been my first love .
Maybe a restaurant where they meet up and do virusy things ?
And thus , &quot; Malicious Dishes &quot; was born .
That started my love for technology .
Pollinator : Deforestsaurus ! I should have known !
I need to call on the rest of the Pollinators !
Ideas can spark a movement .
Ideas are opportunities and innovation .
Ideas truly are what make the world go round .
And I make eco-friendly clothing and accessories .
And I thought , I can start my own business .
I started making more items like hats , scarves and bags .
Soon , my business really started to take off .
They wanted to feature me and my company in their article .
Thank you , and peace and blessings .
But first , what do we call complexity ?
What is complex ?
Well , complex is not complicated .
These are Scottish terriers .
In the beginning , the system is disorganized .
Then comes a perturbation : milk .
So we took ER-1 to the evaluation room .
The robot &apos;s vision system got confused .
Which brings us to bats .
Bechstein &apos;s bats are a common species of European bats .
They are very social animals .
Mostly they roost , or sleep , together .
Okay ? So that &apos;s what this picture looks like .
It turns out this is a very interesting picture .
We call them cryptic social units .
So these bats remember their friends for a really long time .
And this is where complexity brings an answer .
It &apos;s a mathematical model , but it &apos;s not complicated .
Simple , individual rules .
But it gets better .
And I find this incredible .
This is where meerkats live .
I &apos;m sure you know meerkats .
They &apos;re fascinating creatures .
They live in groups with a very strict social hierarchy .
On this road there are cars , so it &apos;s dangerous .
So we asked , how exactly do they do this ?
It &apos;s a simplistic model .
They simply move together .
So again , that &apos;s simplifying complexity .
Thank you .
Nicolas Perony : I &apos;m okay , thanks .
But is it okay to do these associations ?
So that &apos;s it .
Okay . Thank you very much for this great start .
Thank you , Nicolas Perony .
So allow me to tell you about it .
So I have a brother , Gavin .
When this whole shebang happened , he was four .
He loved to cook .
He wanted to be a chef really badly .
I mean , we all had those when we were little .
And he wanted one so badly .
But then he started to realize something .
And this discouraged my brother a lot .
Thank you .
So , needless to say , it was crazy .
It was literally one of the best moments of my life .
So , let &apos;s see .
But then I started to realize something .
Haters gonna hate .
And you can make that change .
Thank you .
Anant Agarwal : Why massive open online courses matter
I &apos;d like to reimagine education .
It starts with an M.
MOOC : massive open online courses .
What &apos;s changed ?
The seats are in color .
Whoop-de-do .
Education really hasn &apos;t changed in the past 500 years .
Everything else has changed around us .
It &apos;s also been a real issue in terms of access .
So what you see here is not a rock concert .
This is a classroom at the Obafemi Awolowo University in Nigeria .
It &apos;s like going from ox carts to the airplane .
Even the infrastructure has to change .
Everything has to change .
We have to go to interactive virtual laboratories and gamification .
Everything really has to change .
And we had no marketing budget .
Now , 155,000 is a big number .
7,200 is also a big number .
Now these large numbers are just one part of the story .
I call it teen-lish .
It &apos;s a digital language .
It &apos;s got two sounds : a grunt and a silence .
&quot; Honey , come over for dinner . &quot;
&quot; Hmm . &quot;
&quot; Did you hear me ? &quot;
Silence . &quot; Can you listen to me ? &quot;
I texted her . I got an instant response .
So I texted her again . Boom , another response .
I said , this is great .
And so since then , our life has changed .
I text her , she responds .
It &apos;s just been absolutely great .
So our millennial generation is built differently .
But our kids are really different .
The millennial generation is completely comfortable with online technology .
So why are we fighting it in the classroom ?
Let &apos;s not fight it . Let &apos;s embrace it .
So here &apos;s what we can do .
They can solve problems together .
We were also doing other pilots .
Now don &apos;t take these results to the bank just yet .
So the results can be extremely , extremely good .
What are some key ideas that makes all of this work ?
One idea is active learning .
Lessons are interleaved sequences of videos and interactive exercises .
Think of this as the ultimate Socratization of education .
You teach by asking questions .
Students learn much better when they are interacting with the material .
The second idea is self-pacing .
They can hit the pause button .
They can rewind the professor .
Heck , they can even mute the professor .
So this form of self-pacing can be very helpful to learning .
The third idea that we have is instant feedback .
the computer grades exercises .
I mean , how else do you teach 150,000 students ?
Your computer is grading all the exercises .
Some are never graded .
So with instant feedback , students can try to apply answers .
If they get it wrong , they can get instant feedback .
The next big idea is gamification .
How do you teach creativity ? How do you teach design ?
And this can also be graded by the computer .
Fifth is peer learning .
Let me tell you a story .
They had answered questions for 100 students .
How do you do that for 150,000 ?
had popped in with a different answer .
Now this is all not just in the future .
This is happening today .
I would like us to really reimagine education .
We will have to move from lecture halls to e-spaces .
The Aakash is 40 dollars .
We have to move from bricks-and-mortar school buildings to digital dormitories .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
I have worked with more than 500 companies .
Why do people feel so miserable , even actively disengaged ?
Disengaging their colleagues .
Acting against the interest of their company .
The way we organize is based on two pillars .
The hard -- structure , processes , systems .
They are obsolete .
We need quality , cost , reliability , speed .
The hard approach creates just complicatedness in the organization .
Let &apos;s take an example .
An automotive company , the engineering division is a five-dimensional matrix .
What happens when the new requirement emerges ?
So , what was the solution using the hard approach ?
And Mr. Repairability creates the repairability process .
That came on top of 25 other KPIs .
What percentage of these people is variable compensation ?
It is basically the interplay .
How the parts work together .
The connections , the interactions , the synapses .
You know , you could call it cooperation , basically .
Whenever people cooperate , they use less resources . In everything .
You know , the repairability issue is a cooperation problem .
Who will pay for that ?
Shareholders ? Customers ?
No , they will refuse .
Stress , burnout , they are overwhelmed , accidents .
No wonder they disengage .
How do the hard and the soft try to foster cooperation ?
They create a middle office .
What happens one year later ?
Plus I have to pay for the middle office .
The hard approach is unable to foster cooperation .
It is totally wrong .
It is even counterproductive .
Look , at home I have two TVs . Why ?
Precisely not to have to cooperate with my wife .
Not to have to impose tradeoffs to my wife .
Definitely , these approaches are obsolete .
Simple rule number one : Understand what others do .
What is their real work ?
Second , you need to reenforce integrators .
How can you reinforce your managers as integrators ?
By removing layers .
And we end up with the Encyclopedia Britannica of rules .
Otherwise , they will withdraw . They will disengage .
These rules , they come from game theory and organizational sociology .
You can increase the shadow of the future .
We will cooperate .
Remove the second TV .
It changes everything .
On human resource management practices .
You create more value with lower cost .
Complicatedness : This is your battle , business leaders .
The real battle is not against competitors .
This is rubbish , very abstract .
When do we meet competitors to fight them ?
Only you can fight , can do it .
Thank you .
Guy Hoffman : Robots with &quot; soul &quot;
So I made a really bad career decision .
He actually did the weasel in Ice Age .
And then put it back in your character .
So you can see my confusion here .
I &apos;m not an actor .
He was already dead !
Just laying there , eyes glazed over ! &quot;
It was after a Passover seder .
Everybody did their own part .
We didn &apos;t have to divide our tasks .
We didn &apos;t have to communicate verbally about this .
It all just happened .
It &apos;s all about information analysis , decision making and planning .
I took off from a Ph.D. I went to acting classes .
But the real revelation was when I learned about method acting .
It became very popular in the 20th century .
Improvise , play off yor scene partner .
And it was like a lightning bolt .
I went back to my office .
That &apos;s what you saw before with the actors .
Maybe it can make for better robotic teammates .
Let &apos;s look at it .
Let &apos;s call it the calculated brain .
The other got more the stage actor , risk taker brain .
Let &apos;s call it the adventurous brain .
It sometimes acts without knowing everything it has to know .
It sometimes makes mistakes and corrects them .
Whatever that means .
Sounds painful .
So let &apos;s look at a few seconds from this performance .
Where the robot listens to the human musician and improvises .
And I started designing a socially expressive head for the robot .
We are wired for that .
It was one of those things you plug your smartphone in .
So , a lot of bobbing head .
And it &apos;s not just fun and games .
Maybe they should be able to take chances and improvise .
Thank you .
Sheryl Sandberg : So we leaned in ... now what ?
Pat Mitchell : Your first time back on the TEDWomen stage .
But I also had noticed that it wasn &apos;t working .
I said , on the TED stage ? Are you kidding ?
Have you seen changes ?
Everywhere I go , women tell me they ask for raises .
You know , 500 times roughly 10 .
There are over 12,000 circles in 50 countries in the world .
PM : Wow , that &apos;s amazing .
I met one of them , I was in Beijing .
And I kind of just started crying .
That &apos;s the kind of change we have to hope for .
SS : The book is about self-confidence , and about equality .
Men only .
And we know there are groups all the way to Ethiopia .
And it &apos;s part of what TEDWomen does .
And you know what we found ?
Seventy-seven cents to the dollar .
If you are a black woman , 64 cents .
If you are a Latina , we &apos;re at 54 cents .
Do you know when the last time those numbers went up ?
2002 .
We are stagnating , we are stagnating in so many ways .
SS : A lot more leaning in .
PM : Thank you , Sheryl .
Thanks for leaning in and saying yes .
SS : Thank you .
Suzanne Talhouk : Don &apos;t kill your language
Good morning !
Are you awake ?
Anyone ! No one ? All right , no problem .
He looked at me strangely , thinking that he misheard .
He said , &quot; Sorry ? . &quot;
I said , &quot; The menu , please . &quot;
&quot; I do . &quot;
Is the French pronunciation correct ?
What &apos;s the meaning of saying &quot; menu &quot; in Arabic ?
How could she speak that way ?
At that moment , I started thinking .
It made me mad . It definitely hurts !
Where could this happen ?
How did we get here ?
To be one of them ?
Where &apos;s the logic in that ?
Despite all that , I tried to understand him .
The Arabic language doesn &apos;t satisfy today &apos;s needs .
This is one reality .
Arabic is the mother tongue .
How ?
So , this is an example no one can argue with .
This is a reality that developed societies are aware of .
That &apos;s why they legislate to protect their language .
They make it sacred .
Do we know better than them ?
They kept it close to them .
You wouldn &apos;t believe it &apos;s a local product .
It doesn &apos;t ring a bell , does it ?
Regardless of the who , how and why .
What is our intellect ?
How do you say whether this guy understands or not ?
How would you feel ?
I asked her once how things were going .
Does she want to commit suicide ?
Translate that for me .
So , what have we done to protect the Arabic language ?
Forget about this headache and go have fun . &quot;
No problem !
Something very easy , yet creative and persuasive .
Why ? Seriously , don &apos;t kill your language .
We really shouldn &apos;t kill our language .
We &apos;d have to find an existence .
We &apos;d go back to the beginning .
Photos of &quot; cool &quot; guys and girls .
We are very cool !
Creativity is the idea .
Creativity in your mother tongue is the path .
Let &apos;s start from this moment .
Let &apos;s write a novel or produce a short film .
A single novel could make us global again .
It could bring the Arabic language back to being number one .
In conclusion , what can you do today ?
Now , tweets , who &apos;s tweeting ?
But don &apos;t write Arabic with Latin characters mixed with numbers !
It &apos;s a disaster ! That &apos;s not a language .
You &apos;d be entering a virtual world with a virtual language .
That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
Second , there are many other things that we can do .
We &apos;re not here today to convince each other .
Now I will tell you a secret .
A baby first identifies its father through language .
Let &apos;s get rid of this cultural cringe .
Diana Nyad : Never , ever give up
The team is proud of our four attempts .
It &apos;s an expedition of some 30 people .
And I &apos;m thinking , what are they imagining ?
And we &apos;ve been on a journey .
Isn &apos;t life about the journey , not really the destination ?
And it was deep . It was deep in my soul .
That &apos;s always there and it &apos;s undeniable .
And so of course I want to make it across .
But the journey itself was worthwhile taking .
And now we &apos;re there .
You &apos;ve never seen black this black .
Now there &apos;s a talent unto itself .
And then there are the crises . Of course there are .
It &apos;s difficult to swim in .
And the hypothermia sets in .
It &apos;s gorgeous .
That &apos;s the everyday machinations .
What a foundation you lay down in reaching for those horizons .
The epic journey is going to be over .
That little tracker that was on the computer ?
To be is to do .
Yeah .
Thank you .
Bonnie , where are you ?
Where are you ?
There &apos;s Bonnie Stoll . My buddy .
And yeah , I stand before you now .
I &apos;ve signed a wonderful major book contract .
Thank you very much and enjoy the conference .
Thank you .
Find a way !
Boyd Varty : What I learned from Nelson Mandela
And so this talk is going to be for him .
I grew up in wonder .
I grew up amongst those animals .
Ubuntu : I am because of you .
Or , people are not people without other people .
Ubuntu is at play right now .
Solly grew up tending to his father &apos;s cattle .
He then moved across into what we called the habitat team .
We worked together as a team .
Solly remained on the bank .
Wham ! It hits me by my right leg .
It &apos;s shaking me violently .
Solly on the bank sees that I &apos;m in trouble .
He turns . He begins to make his way to me .
The croc again continues to shake me .
It goes to bite me a second time .
As it bites the second time , I kick .
My foot goes down its throat . It spits me out .
My leg from the knee down is mangled beyond description .
The bone is cracked .
The meat is torn up .
He comes straight into the channel .
He wades in to above his waist .
He gets to me . He grabs me .
I &apos;m still in a vulnerable position .
He picks me and puts me on his shoulder .
He turns . He walks me up the bank .
He lays me down . He pulls his shirt off .
And I survive .
Danger is shared . Pain is shared .
Joy is shared . Achievement is shared .
Houses are shared . Food is shared .
And then I met this young lady .
Her name was Elvis .
She was born with very badly deformed back legs and pelvis .
And yet still I remained amazed that she was surviving .
It was sort of a hollow in the ground .
The rest of the herd turned and began to follow .
And on the third attempt , an amazing thing happened .
Thank you .
Boyd Varty : Well thanks , Pat .
He was suffering .
And so of course there &apos;s the mixed emotions .
I mean , that &apos;s just incredible humility .
And everything , they used to call it Madiba magic .
Anywhere he went , things went well .
Dambisa Moyo : Is China the new idol for emerging economies ?
&quot; Give me liberty or give me death . &quot;
Who could blame them ?
This schism has only grown wider .
Now , don &apos;t get me wrong .
Of course they would .
And rather than have private capitalism , they have state capitalism .
Instead of liberal democracy , they have de-prioritized the democratic system .
Today , it &apos;s closer to 82 percent .
So in its totality , economic improvement has been quite significant .
Now this is something that people can see and point to .
I want to be able to do what China &apos;s doing .
That is the system that seems to work . &quot;
What might that world look like ?
And I suggest that they have two options .
The West can either compete or cooperate .
At its very best , the Western model speaks for itself .
It &apos;s the model that put food on the table .
It &apos;s the refrigerators .
It put a man on the moon .
Just to illustrate , I went into my annals of myself .
That &apos;s a picture of me .
Awww . I was born and raised in Zambia in 1969 .
This is an affidavit from the Zambian government .
In this vein , we can increase economic growth .
We can meaningfully put a dent in poverty .
Thank you very much .
Abha Dawesar : Life in the &quot; digital now &quot;
The stores nearby were out of flashlights and batteries and bread .
But these were not the major preoccupations of my day .
I wasn &apos;t the only one .
They &apos;re both stories , interpretations .
You and I can experience things without a story .
It needs months and years .
Discrete moments from our lives are its chapters .
But the story is not about these chapters .
It &apos;s the whole book .
Without it , we would have no music .
I think that technology has altered that flow of time .
What happens when that arrow goes awry ?
What happens when time warps ?
Far away over there is now here .
And that &apos;s not all .
Are you reading an interview by an author ?
Why not buy his book ? Tweet it . Share it .
Like it . Find other books exactly like his .
Find other people reading those books .
And therein lies its greatest convenience and horror .
Sandy was a reminder of how such an illusion can shatter .
There were those with power and water , and those without .
How does one live inside distraction ?
Possibly , but I remember my childhood .
They &apos;re like soap bubbles that disappear when we touch them .
It cannot be stored .
At such moments , our selves are complete .
The present encapsulates the past and a promise for the future .
The present joins a flow of time from before and after .
I first experienced these feelings with my grandmother .
Attention is time .
It threatens the flow of love .
But we don &apos;t need to let it .
We can choose otherwise .
We can choose to take time back .
Thank you .
Michael Porter : Why business can be good at solving social problems
Serious problems , big problems , pressing problems .
We &apos;re all very aware .
Why are we having so much trouble dealing with these problems ?
I &apos;m not a social problem guy .
God forbid .
Business is not seen as the solution .
It &apos;s seen as the problem now , for most people .
And rightly so , in many cases .
So this perspective is perhaps justified .
And many of us here are deeply involved in that .
Even a business school professor has thought about it that way .
We &apos;ve been aware of these problems for decades .
The awkward reality is we &apos;re not making fast enough progress .
We &apos;re not winning .
We &apos;re making incremental progress .
We can &apos;t scale .
We can make progress . We can show benefits .
We can show results . We can make things better .
We can &apos;t scale .
We can &apos;t make a large-scale impact on these problems .
Why is that ?
Because we don &apos;t have the resources .
And that &apos;s really clear now .
And that &apos;s clearer now than it &apos;s been for decades .
We &apos;ve got to confront that reality .
All wealth is actually created by business .
Business creates wealth when it meets needs at a profit .
That &apos;s how all wealth is created .
That &apos;s where all the resources come from .
Only business can actually create resources .
The resources are overwhelmingly generated by business .
The question then is , how do we tap into this ?
How do we tap into this ?
Business generates those resources when it makes a profit .
But that profit is the magic .
The solution becomes self-sustaining .
That &apos;s what business does when it makes a profit .
Now what does this all have to do with social problems ?
Business should give more .
Business should be more responsible .
I &apos;m proud of that .
The classic example is pollution .
It &apos;s profitable to have an unsafe working environment .
That &apos;s been the conventional wisdom .
A lot of companies have fallen into that conventional wisdom .
They resisted environmental improvement .
They resisted workplace improvement .
That &apos;s a very simplistic view .
That &apos;s where the real profit comes .
Let &apos;s take pollution .
It saves money .
It makes the business more productive and efficient .
It doesn &apos;t waste resources .
Accidents are expensive and costly .
Another issue is health .
This is an example of Jain Irrigation .
That &apos;s shared value .
We can address shared value at multiple levels .
It &apos;s real . It &apos;s happening .
We &apos;re now seeing companies embrace this idea .
I know it . I &apos;m seeing it .
I &apos;m feeling it .
Thank you .
Stuart Firestein : The pursuit of ignorance
I &apos;d like to tell you that &apos;s not the case .
So what was the difference ?
That &apos;s clearly not true .
And that &apos;s not really the case either .
We talk about what we don &apos;t know .
This is the stuff that &apos;s exhilarating and interesting .
It is , if you will , the ignorance .
That &apos;s what was missing .
That &apos;s another story , perhaps .
I mean a different kind of ignorance .
I think it &apos;s a wonderful idea : thoroughly conscious ignorance .
How can you ever know all of this ?
And indeed , the scientific literature grows at an alarming rate .
In 2006 , there were 1.3 million papers published .
We just don &apos;t worry about it , in a way .
We don &apos;t have any such guarantee .
So I think the puzzle model doesn &apos;t work .
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s the way it works either .
So the knowledge generates ignorance .
It &apos;s rather kind of the other way around , really .
What do we use this knowledge for ?
What are we using this collection of facts for ?
Scientists argue about this all the time .
Sometimes we call them bull sessions .
Sometimes we call them grant proposals .
But nonetheless , it &apos;s what the argument is about .
It &apos;s what makes a good question .
So how do we think about these questions ?
Doesn &apos;t know much but they have a lot of interest .
They &apos;re interested in almost everything .
Because it &apos;s not always quite so straightforward .
We walk around on two legs .
That seems kind of simple , somehow or another .
So that maybe is not that interesting .
How about the visual system ?
There it is , the visual system .
What ought we to be studying ?
How do we turn molecules into perceptions ?
What &apos;s the process by which that could happen ?
And you don &apos;t even think about it , do you ?
We just can &apos;t sell facts for a living anymore .
How do we do that ?
They like to investigate things . They go to science museums .
They like to play around . They &apos;re in second grade .
They &apos;re interested .
Is this what we want ?
You know . You can imagine what it is .
This can &apos;t possibly continue to go on .
Geneticists always say , you always get what you screen for .
And that &apos;s meant as a warning .
That &apos;s the one I like in particular .
Thank you .
Thank you .
I had just gone through a breakup .
So there is a catch . There is a catch .
Xu Liu : Test mice .
As simple as that .
SR : Are you convinced ?
But memory is not .
So yeah , this task does seem to be daunting .
But luckily , we got help from the brain itself .
It shouldn &apos;t take minutes or hours to work .
SR : So what do you think , Xu ?
And also it takes them forever to act on cells .
XL : Yep . You heard it right .
We are trying to shoot lasers into the brain .
They learn that something bad happened here .
So your best response of defense is trying to be undetected .
SR : All right , and here &apos;s the million-dollar experiment .
XL : And this is what we saw .
It &apos;s interesting .
Clearly it &apos;s freezing .
SR : &quot; Did that just work ? &quot;
We &apos;re really excited about this .
And then we published our findings in the journal Nature .
Maybe we can take a look at some of those .
Could we possibly even turn it into a false memory ?
Yes we can .
It &apos;s sort of like making a remix tape .
SR : So how do we do this ?
We &apos;re just trying to connect the two .
I also see a world where we can erase unwanted memories .
How do we push this technology forward ?
Thank you . XL : Thank you .
Peter Attia : Is the obesity crisis hiding a bigger problem ?
That wasn &apos;t being asked .
The cancer was too advanced .
I brought some for her parents .
She was fat .
I mean , how hard can it be ?
Why did I feel justified in judging her ?
I &apos;d like to say I don &apos;t know .
But I actually do .
She ate too much . She got unlucky .
She got diabetes . Case closed .
Three years later , I found out how wrong I was .
But this time , I was the patient .
Some of you may have heard of this .
I had become insulin-resistant .
This is called fuel partitioning in the lingo .
Now failure to produce enough insulin is incompatible with life .
More importantly , I don &apos;t have insulin resistance .
You treat the obesity .
But what if we have it backwards ?
Cause and effect .
Let &apos;s look at some suggestive facts .
It &apos;s more likely too much glucose : blood sugar .
I &apos;m betting my career on this .
I &apos;ve been humbled enough by all I don &apos;t know .
Some think it &apos;s too many calories consumed .
Others think it &apos;s too much dietary fat .
Others think it &apos;s too many refined grains and starches .
Sometimes I think back to that night in the E.R.
seven years ago .
I wish I could speak with that woman again .
I &apos;d like to tell her how sorry I am .
You didn &apos;t need my judgment and my contempt .
Paul Pholeros : How to reduce poverty ? Fix homes
The idea of eliminating poverty is a great goal .
I don &apos;t think anyone in this room would disagree .
I &apos;ll leave that to others .
Housing For Health works with poor people .
Yami assembled a team in Alice Springs .
He got a medical doctor .
He got an environmental health guy .
Always a good start , no money .
You have six months .
That was our task .
Come on .
Big ideas need big words and preferably a lot of them .
This didn &apos;t fit the bill .
I &apos;m going to ask you to do some more work .
If you get a green tick , your shower &apos;s working .
You and your kids are fine .
Why ? Because you &apos;re all too old .
We &apos;re really concerned with kids naught to five .
They leave a lifelong remnant .
And the same test for the electrical system and the toilets .
Housing for Health projects aren &apos;t about measuring failure .
They &apos;re actually about improving houses .
That &apos;s our average budget .
It &apos;s very easy to spend money .
Why are the houses in such poor condition ?
Things wear out .
Should have been done by state government or local government .
Simply not done , the house doesn &apos;t work .
They don &apos;t work . We have to fix them .
And we &apos;ll go a lot further than that .
They do all aspects of the work .
The developing world bug trachoma , it causes blindness .
Okay , what do we do ?
Well , first thing we do , we get showers working .
Why ? Because that flushes the bug out .
We wash the bug out .
He was loaned to us by a mining company .
So we used dirt to stop dust .
We did it . He provided us dust monitors .
We tested and we reduced the dust .
Then we wanted to get rid of the bug generally .
So how do we do that ?
We changed the environment , not just treated the eyes .
And finally , you get a good eye .
A 40-percent reduction .
Health was poor .
It was choking with smoke .
People were cooking on their only fuel source , green timber .
So all of a sudden we had two problems .
But all of a sudden now there was a second problem .
I put it to you , is this eliminating poverty ?
And I don &apos;t pretend anything else .
Well over 1,000 people use those toilets .
Yami Lama , he &apos;s a young boy .
Kanji Maya , she &apos;s a mother and a proud one .
And that , to me , is the key .
People are not the problem .
We &apos;ve never found that .
Thank you very much for your time .
