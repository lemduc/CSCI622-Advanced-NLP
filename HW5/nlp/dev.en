This is not a finished story .
It is a jigsaw puzzle still being put together .
Let me tell you about some of the pieces .
Words , for so long his friends , now mocked him .
He retreated into silence .
He died broken by history .
He is my grandfather .
I never knew him in real life .
But our lives are much more than our memories .
My grandmother never let me forget his life .
It was inconceivable to her that she would not succeed .
All the adults knew the risks .
The greatest fear was of pirates , rape and death .
No apple has ever tasted the same .
Somehow she found time to study English and gain IT qualifications .
We were poor .
Go home to where ?
Something stiffened inside me .
My mother suffered from nightmares all about the boat .
Grants and sponsors were sought .
Centers were established .
I lived in parallel worlds .
But so many over the years were helped .
I didn &apos;t know the protocols .
I didn &apos;t know how to use the cutlery .
I didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
I didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
I told my mother I couldn &apos;t do it .
No had never been an option .
There had to be another piece of the jigsaw .
Possibilities that would not have been allowed were outrageously encouraged .
So I followed my hunches .
For a year we were penniless .
We worked well into each night .
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
after only one trip .
My hunches again .
Life hadn &apos;t changed for centuries .
Her father died soon after she was born .
Her mother raised her alone .
I knew she had come to say goodbye .
My mother phoned minutes later .
My mother asked us to feel her hand .
&quot; You have not let it go . &quot;
Defeat would have come too easily .
Who could ever wish it on their own ?
I don &apos;t know .
Well this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
And I mention that because I think identity is really important .
And we &apos;ve had some fantastic presentations .
And so I want to talk about the power of identity .
I actually learned about this from my grandmother .
She was tough , she was strong , she was powerful .
She was the end of every argument in our family .
She was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved .
And my grandmother was tough , but she was also loving .
And the only challenge was that she had 10 children .
My mom was the youngest of her 10 kids .
My cousins would be running around everywhere .
And my grandmother was sitting across the room staring at me .
And at first I thought we were playing a game .
And I remember this just like it happened yesterday .
I never will forget it .
I said , &quot; Okay , Mama . &quot;
And she said , &quot; I think you &apos;re special . &quot;
I will never forget it .
I said , &quot; Okay , Mama . &quot;
And then my brother started staring at me .
I was devastated .
And I &apos;m going to admit something to you .
I &apos;m going to tell you something I probably shouldn &apos;t .
I know this might be broadcast broadly .
My grandfather was in prison during prohibition .
My male uncles died of alcohol-related diseases .
In 1972 , there were 300,000 people in jails and prisons .
Today , there are 2.3 million .
We have seven million people on probation and parole .
Wealth , not culpability , shapes outcomes .
And yet , we seem to be very comfortable .
We &apos;ve been disconnected .
It &apos;s interesting to me .
We &apos;re looking at some very interesting developments in our work .
And there is this stunning silence .
I represent children .
A lot of my clients are very young .
We have life imprisonment without parole for kids in this country .
And we &apos;re actually doing some litigation .
The only country in the world .
I represent people on death row .
It &apos;s interesting , this question of the death penalty .
And that &apos;s a very sensible question .
I mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
Death penalty in America is defined by error .
I mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
But somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem .
It &apos;s not our problem .
It &apos;s not our burden .
It &apos;s not our struggle .
I talk a lot about these issues .
We don &apos;t really know very much about it .
In many communities , people had to worry about being lynched .
They had to worry about being bombed .
It was the threat of terror that shaped their lives .
We don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
We &apos;re constantly running into each other .
We &apos;re constantly creating tensions and conflicts .
I was giving some lectures in Germany about the death penalty .
And I thought about that .
I couldn &apos;t bear it .
It would be unconscionable .
And yet , there is this disconnect .
Well I believe that our identity is at risk .
We love innovation .
We love technology . We love creativity .
We love entertainment .
And for me , it becomes necessary to integrate the two .
Vaclav Havel , the great Czech leader , talked about this .
It will get to you .
And these women would get together and just talk .
Do you want to come over and listen ? &quot;
I said , &quot; I &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
It would be so energizing and so empowering .
Tell me what you &apos;re trying to do . &quot;
And I began giving her my rap .
I said , &quot; Well we &apos;re trying to challenge injustice .
We &apos;re trying to help people who have been wrongly convicted .
We &apos;re trying to end life without parole sentences for children .
We &apos;re trying to do something about the death penalty .
We &apos;re trying to reduce the prison population .
We &apos;re trying to end mass incarceration . &quot;
Because ultimately , our humanity depends on everyone &apos;s humanity .
It &apos;s just taught me very simple things .
I believe that for every person on the planet .
I don &apos;t believe that .
I sometimes push too hard .
I do get tired , as we all do .
I start thinking , well , how did that happen ?
Yeah , Bryan , the judge has some magic power .
You should ask for some of that .
And this man came over to me and he hugged me .
And he whispered in my ear .
He said , &quot; I &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
And I have to tell you , it was energizing .
Well I went into the courtroom .
And people started coming in because they were just outraged .
I had written these crazy things .
and assistant prosecutors and clerk workers .
He kept pacing back and forth .
Thank you very much .
Other than writing a check , what could we do ?
Well there are opportunities all around us .
56 percent of all rape cases don &apos;t result .
So there &apos;s an opportunity to change that .
And I think that opportunity exists all around us .
What would you say to someone who believed that ?
Well actually the violent crime rate has remained relatively stable .
It was this misguided war on drugs .
And we got carried away with the rhetoric of punishment .
Bryan , you &apos;ve struck a massive chord here .
You &apos;re an inspiring person .
Thank you so much for coming to TED . Thank you .
I &apos;m going to speak about a tiny , little idea .
And this is about shifting baseline .
He was actually collecting fish .
And he described one of them as very &quot; common . &quot;
This was the sailfin grouper .
A big fishery was run on it until the &apos; 80s .
Now the fish is on the IUCN Red List .
But the point is , we still come to Galapagos .
We still think it is pristine .
The brochures still say it is untouched .
So what happens here ?
And I thought I could blend in .
This was my first sunburn .
They were maturing at five centimeters .
They had been pushed genetically .
There were still fishes .
They were still kind of happy .
And the fish also were happy to be there .
So nothing has changed , but everything has changed .
And these pictures are extraordinary because this transition is very rapid .
This is a dead turtle .
And one time we caught a live one .
It was not drowned yet .
But it &apos;s not documented .
We transform the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
If you generalize this , something like this happens .
And the difference then , they perceive as a loss .
But they don &apos;t perceive what happened before as a loss .
You can have a succession of changes .
At the end you want to sustain miserable leftovers .
So you don &apos;t lose abundant animals .
You always lose rare animals .
And therefore they &apos;re not perceived as a big loss .
They become rarer because we fish them .
And the question is , why do people accept this ?
Well because they don &apos;t know that it was different .
Because with marine protected areas , we actually recreate the past .
This is a simulation of Chesapeake Bay .
Because it evokes something that in a sense has been lost .
Thank you very much .
Do you know how many choices you make in typical week ?
Think about your own choices .
I want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions .
Thank you .
It was a store called Draeger &apos;s .
Here &apos;s their olive oil aisle .
Here &apos;s their jam aisle .
They had 348 different kinds of jam .
Now we see the opposite effect .
So now for the topic of today : financial savings .
And what we found was that indeed there was a correlation .
The first : Cut .
People are always upset when I say , &quot; Cut . &quot;
They &apos;re always worried they &apos;re going to lose shelf space .
The typical Walmart today offers you 100,000 products .
They &apos;re all important choices . &quot;
Here &apos;s a description of the road .
And I &apos;d like you to read it .
Is that all ?
All right , let me show you some more about this .
You guys knew there was a trick , didn &apos;t you .
Now who &apos;s ready to go on this trip .
I think I might have actually heard more hands .
All right .
Because the pictures made it feel more real to you .
Because it doesn &apos;t feel like real money .
The third technique : Categorization .
We can handle more categories than we can handle choices .
But you know what ?
Because the categories tell me how to tell them apart .
Here are two different jewelry displays .
Okay , there &apos;s some .
Okay , a bit more .
Now it turns out you &apos;re right .
This is a highly useless categorization scheme .
Who are they actually supposed to be informing ?
My fourth technique : Condition for complexity .
We have to gradually increase the complexity .
Engines , gearshift -- four choices .
What am I going to look at ?
How engaged you are .
We &apos;re losing them .
So let me recap .
Thank you very much .
Hey , why not ?
We all love baseball , don &apos;t we ?
Baseball is filled with some amazing statistics .
And there &apos;s hundreds of them .
It &apos;s called batting average .
Three times out of 10 .
Good , really good , maybe an all-star .
Do you know what they call a 400 baseball hitter ?
Somehow this isn &apos;t working out , is it ?
But , but , you know what ?
And she &apos;s hitting a 257 .
Somehow this isn &apos;t working .
But I &apos;m going to ask you a question .
1,000 , very good .
I was an obsessive compulsive student .
And so I did .
And I memorized everything .
and to report back to my attending .
And I saw Mrs. Drucker , and she was breathless .
And that wasn &apos;t a difficult diagnosis to make .
I made it and I set to work treating her .
And I felt really good .
Actually , I made two more mistakes .
I sent her home without speaking to my attending .
Maybe I did it for a good reason .
Maybe I didn &apos;t want to be a high-maintenance resident .
The second mistake that I made was worse .
I can remember that like it was yesterday .
And I went back to my work on the wards .
But I carried on with my work .
I walked through the emergency department on my way home .
The three words are : Do you remember ?
&quot; Do you remember that patient you sent home ? &quot;
the other nurse asked matter-of-factly .
Well she was back all right .
She was back and near death .
And she was barely breathing and she was blue .
And the emerg. staff pulled out all the stops .
They gave her medications to raise her blood pressure .
They put her on a ventilator .
And I was shocked and shaken to the core .
She had irreversible brain damage .
And the family gathered .
They say you never forget the names of those who die .
And that was my first time to be acquainted with that .
And you make amends and you never make that mistake again .
That &apos;s the kind of shame that is a teacher .
And it was what I was feeling .
And I kept asking myself these questions .
Why did I go into medicine ?
Slowly but surely , it lifted .
I began to feel a bit better .
And they did .
And I went back to work .
And then it happened again .
He kept pointing here .
And she said the three words : Do you remember ?
He had a potentially life-threatening condition called epiglottitis .
And fortunately he didn &apos;t die .
Twice in one emergency shift , I missed appendicitis .
One I thought had a kidney stone .
The other one had a lot of diarrhea .
Some of my doozies have been in the last five years .
Alone , ashamed and unsupported .
That &apos;s the system that we have .
It &apos;s a complete denial of mistakes .
But there are two problems with that .
And what I &apos;ve learned is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous .
And here &apos;s the thing .
Sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive .
We can &apos;t get rid of it .
I don &apos;t take the same history .
Given all of that , mistakes are inevitable .
What they need is a redefined medical culture .
And it starts with one physician at a time .
She shares her experience with others .
She &apos;s supportive when other people talk about their mistakes .
My name is Brian Goldman .
I am a redefined physician .
I &apos;m human . I make mistakes .
It &apos;s true .
So how does it happen ?
Three things : tastemakers , communities of participation and unexpectedness .
All right , let &apos;s go .
Oh , my God . Oh , my God .
Oh , my God !
Wooo !
Ohhhhh , wowwww !
In 2010 , it was viewed 23 million times .
He just wanted to share a rainbow .
And he had posted lots of nature videos in fact .
So what happened here ?
Jimmy Kimmel actually .
It &apos;s been seen nearly 200 million times this year .
This is a chart of what it looked like .
So what happened on this day ?
Well it was a Friday , this is true .
But what about this day , this one particular Friday ?
It &apos;s this , just like this .
It &apos;s been viewed nearly 50 million times this year .
Even cats were watching this video .
Cats were watching other cats watch this video .
There were remixes .
Someone made an old timey version .
And then it went international .
Because we don &apos;t just enjoy now , we participate .
And who could have predicted any of this ?
And so it all brings us to one big question ...
What does this mean ?
Ohhhh .
What does it mean ?
No one has to green-light your idea .
Thank you .
Today I &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
Now I work in the solar technology industry .
... paying attention to crowd-sourcing .
It &apos;s just a quick video of what we do .
Huh . Hang on a moment .
It might take a moment to load .
No .
This is not ...
Okay .
Solar technology is ...
Oh , that &apos;s all my time ?
Okay . Thank you very much .
Now we do the same with airplanes .
Now we do the same with drills and machines .
And this made me really sad .
I found myself becoming a little bit of a technophobe .
They stopped us from being inspired .
I &apos;ve been illustrating books since I was 16 .
It can know how we &apos;re holding it .
It can know where we are .
Storytelling is becoming more and more multi-sensorial .
But what are we doing with it ?
And actually I become a character in the book .
Now I &apos;ve been talking a lot about magic .
And it opens up a map .
So I &apos;m just going to enter in .
Over here , these are the Apsaras .
And somehow kids don &apos;t do that anymore .
At one point , your screen is filled up with leaves .
We &apos;re harnessing energy from the sun .
Thank you .
Something really weird is going on here .
So , if you could bring up the lights .
Now why do we draw technology curves in semi-log curves ?
They sort of go like this .
And they don &apos;t tell us much .
But when something like this happens , things are qualitatively changing .
It &apos;s not moving like that .
One of two things is going to happen .
That &apos;s about all it can do .
What &apos;s that new state that the world is heading toward ?
It &apos;s about as far as we go out .
That transition is happening . We can all sense it .
And those that were like that started to split and divide .
And so every drop was a little bit different .
So those tended to live longer , get expressed more .
So what was the next step ?
Writing down the DNA was an interesting step .
And in fact , we &apos;re such a multi-cellular community .
Now the next step that happened is within these communities .
These communities of cells , again , began to abstract information .
And those are the neural structures .
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage .
Because evolution could now happen within an individual .
It could happen in learning time scales .
So now we &apos;ve speeded up the time scales once again .
The more it changes , the faster it changes .
We &apos;re seeing this process feeding back on itself .
There are billions of them .
So in other words , I define what I wanted .
So find the programs that come closest to sorting numbers .
Save those . Kill off the rest .
Say , &quot; Please repeat that process . &quot;
Score them again .
Introduce some mutations perhaps .
And try that again and do that for another generation .
Well every one of those generations just takes a few milliseconds .
They &apos;re obscure , weird programs .
But they do the job .
In fact , their life depended on doing the job .
So in a sense , it &apos;s getting ahead of us .
So it &apos;s feeding back on itself .
Because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves .
We &apos;re taking off .
We &apos;re right at that point of transition .
So meet Al .
Al is a fire hydrant in the city of Boston .
So you agree to dig it out when it snows .
So it &apos;s got cute little game dynamics on it .
This is a modest little app .
But it &apos;s doing something that no other government technology does .
It &apos;s spreading virally .
So he &apos;s getting citizens to check on them .
And this has spread just frictionlessly , organically , naturally .
Procuring software usually takes a couple of years .
And that &apos;s nothing .
And there are projects like this at every level of government .
And that &apos;s important .
They haven &apos;t given up on government .
And these folks know something that we &apos;ve lost sight of .
Now a lot of people have given up on government .
Politics is not changing ; government is changing .
This is the call center for the services and information line .
So Scott gets this call .
He types &quot; Opossum &quot; into this official knowledge base .
So that worked . So booya for Scott .
But that wasn &apos;t the end of the opossums .
Boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center .
Now we didn &apos;t write this app .
How do I get this removed ? &quot;
But what happens with Citizens Connect is different .
So Scott was speaking person-to-person .
And in this case , a neighbor saw it .
Opossum ? Check . Living ? Yep .
Turned trashcan on its side . Walked home .
Goodnight sweet opossum . &quot;
Pretty simple .
It connected those two people .
When one neighbor helps another , we strengthen our communities .
That our input to the system of government is voting .
And what &apos;s under that is what we call bureaucracy .
And we say that word with such contempt .
People seem to think politics is sexy .
Because that &apos;s where the real work of government happens .
We have to engage with the machinery of government .
So that &apos;s OccupytheSEC movement has done .
Have you seen these guys ?
They &apos;re using their hands .
We &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
Thank you .
How could we help you ? &quot;
It &apos;s got one knob , on / off .
And every morning I hop on it .
And I put my challenge on 95 kg .
But there &apos;s another thing .
As of next week , it will soon be available .
We &apos;ve all got navigation controls in our car .
We maybe even &#91; have &#93; it in our cellphone .
And sure , we could find fast food chains .
But where would be the nearest AED to help this patient ?
We asked around and nobody knew .
So what we did , we crowdsourced The Netherlands .
And we built an iPad application .
And we would like to start this on a worldwide level .
Thank you .
I &apos;m here to share my photography .
Or is it photography ?
I felt like anyone could do that .
Photos like this : construction going on along a busy road .
But it has an unexpected twist .
And despite that , it retains a level of realism .
When I say realism , I mean photo-realism .
But what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
Is it something about the details or the colors ?
Is it something about the light ?
What creates the illusion ?
Sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
So I think the basics are quite simple .
And let me show you a simple example .
But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
And I see the same process with combining photographs .
It &apos;s just really about combining different realities .
As you can see , these images aren &apos;t really special .
But combined , they can create something like this .
Secondly , photos combined should have the same type of light .
Make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed .
So here &apos;s another example .
But it does require a lot of planning .
The shores are from a different location .
The underwater part was captured in a stone pit .
It always starts with a sketch , an idea .
Then it &apos;s about combining the different photographs .
And here every piece is very well planned .
Thank you .
Essentially concrete blocks had become the building block of our time .
It was called the Automatic Binding Brick .
LEGO made it accessible .
A few years ago I started developing littleBits .
Let me show you how they work .
LittleBits are electronic modules with each one specific function .
So you can &apos;t put them the wrong way .
The bricks are color-coded .
I &apos;m going to stop that .
So beyond simple play , littleBits are actually pretty powerful .
The idea behind littleBits is that it &apos;s a growing library .
And it &apos;s been an incredible experience .
We &apos;ve also been taking littleBits to design schools .
But wait , this is actually my favorite project .
And we want to make this material accessible to everyone .
So littleBits is open-source .
So go ahead and start inventing .
Thank you .
We would never do that in our own countries .
This is happening to us today .
And nobody seems to be making a fuss about it .
We have three main groups .
We have online criminals .
And the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
These guys make money .
Here &apos;s Vladimir Tsastsin form Tartu in Estonia .
This is Alfred Gonzalez .
This is Stephen Watt .
This is Bjorn Sundin .
And then we look at cases like what happened in DigiNotar .
Somebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly .
And his answer was yes .
Well DigiNotar is a C.A.
They sell certificates .
What do you do with certificates ?
Except they can if they hack into a foreign C.A.
and issue rogue certificates .
And this is exactly what happened with the case of DigiNotar .
Among those papers , was this binder entitled &quot; FINFISHER . &quot;
The company headquarters are right here .
But Western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
But today , it goes beyond that .
They will tap your Internet connection .
Why should I worry ?
Because I have nothing to hide . &quot;
And this is an argument , which doesn &apos;t make sense .
Privacy is implied .
Privacy is not up for discussion .
This is not a question between privacy against security .
It &apos;s a question of freedom against control .
