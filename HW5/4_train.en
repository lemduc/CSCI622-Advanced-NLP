Rachel Pike : The science behind a climate headline
That report was written by 620 scientists from 40 countries .
They wrote almost a thousand pages on the topic .
Over 15,000 scientists go to San Francisco every year for that .
We blow it up and look at the pieces .
This is the EUPHORE Smog Chamber in Spain .
But still , we look at the pieces .
And it takes weeks to perform our integrations .
We also fly all over the world looking for this thing .
And this is the tower from below .
So maybe you took a similar aircraft to get here today .
We hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering .
We have to get special flight clearance .
So you can imagine the scale of the effort .
Thank you very much .
Christopher deCharms : A look inside the brain in real time
You can mimic what you can see .
You can program the hundreds of muscles in your arm .
I &apos;m going to tell you about that technology .
People envision this as being very difficult .
It was terribly dangerous .
You could be attacked by white blood cells in the arteries .
But now , we have a real technology to do this .
We &apos;re going to fly into my colleague Peter &apos;s brain .
We &apos;re going to do it non-invasively using MRI .
He can look at these 65,000 points of activation per second .
So put your arms back up and flex your bicep .
When they control their brain , they can control their pain .
When you do , what do you want to control ?
But I want to leave with you the big question .
Where will we take it ?
Beeban Kidron : The shared wonder of film
We are inveterate storytellers .
Cinema is arguably the 20th century &apos;s most influential art form .
As a filmmaker , it worried me .
The films were curated and contextualized .
The outcome , immediate .
It was an education of the most profound and transformative kind .
It &apos;s a remarkable comment on slums , poverty and aspiration .
Frank Capra &apos;s classic values independence and propriety .
After all , Jimmy Stewart filibustered for two entire reels .
As they watch more films their lives got palpably richer .
&quot; Pickpocket &quot; started a debate about criminality disenfranchisement .
&quot; To Sir , with Love &quot; ignited its teen audience .
And those without friends started making them .
The films provided communality across all manner of divide .
And the stories they held provided a shared experience .
Who was right , who wrong ?
What would they do under the same conditions ?
Was the tale told well ?
Was there a hidden message ?
How has the world changed ? How could it be different ?
And they themselves had not known they cared .
I have an aunt who is a wonderful storyteller .
I was past 40 when my father died .
He never mentioned that journey .
After two years in hiding , my grandfather appeared in London .
He was never right again .
And his story was hushed as he assimilated .
But within the reels lie purpose and meaning .
Consider &quot; Citizen Kane &quot; as valuable as Jane Austen .
They are neither feral nor myopically self-absorbed .
Thank you .
Ellen Jorgensen : Biohacking -- you can do it , too
It &apos;s a great time to be a molecular biologist .
Reading and writing DNA code is getting easier and cheaper .
Biotech is probably the most powerful and the fastest-growing technology sector .
So who gets to do it ?
But what about that guy ?
In 2009 , I first heard about DIYbio .
I thought so .
The press started calling us .
Let me take you on a little tour .
Biohackers work alone .
We reverse engineer lab equipment .
We genetically engineer bacteria .
We like to build things .
Then we like to take things apart .
We make things grow .
We make things glow .
And we make cells dance .
I &apos;m not going to minimize those concerns .
That &apos;s a lot more than conventional science has done .
Now , we follow state and local regulations .
I &apos;ve actually chosen to take a different kind of risk .
I signed up for something called the Personal Genome Project .
So this stuff is just beginning .
We &apos;re only seeing just the tip of the DNA iceberg .
Let me show you what you could do right now .
I discovered an invasive species in my own backyard .
Looked like a ladybug , right ?
It actually is a Japanese beetle .
You can make some sort of a biofuel cell .
You can do a lot of things .
It &apos;s really cool .
Some people ask me , well , why am I involved ?
I could have a perfectly good career in mainstream science .
It just has to follow safety guidelines .
It &apos;s spaces like these that spawned personal computing .
Why not personal biotech ?
Geert Chatrou : A whistleblower you haven &apos;t heard
Thank you very much .
That was whistling .
I &apos;m trying to do this in English .
So I whistled along with him .
I whistled alone . I whistled in the classroom .
I whistled on &#91; my &#93; bike . I whistled everywhere .
So &quot; Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer &quot; -- you know it ?
But it can also sound like this .
And I just couldn &apos;t .
So , okay , I &apos;m going to America .
I would love to , but why ?
So I immediately called her up , of course .
She didn &apos;t expect me to go there .
And I would have lost my face .
I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s correct English .
But the Dutch people here will understand what I mean .
I lost my face .
And she thought , &quot; He will never go there . &quot;
But actually I did .
That was great fun , of course .
Then I couldn &apos;t participate for a few years .
And actually I earn my money whistling at the moment .
So I quit my day job as a nurse .
Okay , I &apos;m not the only one whistling here .
You say , &quot; Huh , what do you mean ? &quot;
Well actually , you are going to whistle along .
Why ? Can I go away ? &quot;
No , you can &apos;t .
Actually it &apos;s very simple .
It &apos;s about 80 minutes long .
No , no , no . It &apos;s four minutes long .
And I want to first rehearse with you your whistling .
So I whistle the tone .
Sorry . I forgot one thing .
You whistle the same tone as me .
I heard a wide variety of tones .
This is very promising .
This is very promising .
I &apos;ll ask the technicians to start the music .
Oh , hah .
I &apos;m so sorry , technicians .
I &apos;m so used to that .
I start it myself .
Okay , here it is .
Okay .
It &apos;s easy , isn &apos;t it ?
Now comes the solo . I propose I do that myself .
Geert Chatrou : Thank you . Thank you .
Francesca Fedeli : Ciao .
So he &apos;s Mario . He &apos;s our son .
But in the end everything seemed to be under control .
So he got the right weight at birth .
He got the right Apgar index .
So we were pretty reassured by this .
As you might know , a stroke is a brain injury .
So life had to change .
We needed to change our schedule .
As you may imagine , unfortunately , we were not ready .
And that has been really a tough time .
And what went wrong ?
Will he be able to be normal ?
Honestly , we went down .
So immediately , as Francesca said , we changed our life .
Basically , we spent months doing this with Mario .
He was looking at us .
We were his mirror .
And that day really changed our perspective .
And we started from our passions .
This short video is from last week .
This is why we are here .
Mario !
And we thank you so much , all of you .
Thank you . Thank you . Bye .
Thank you .
Mark Shaw : One very dry demo
Not anymore .
Porous , nonporous .
So what &apos;s superhydrophobic ?
A windshield coating is going to give you about 110 degrees .
Did you guess the one that was dry ?
And we &apos;re talking really small here .
So very small , but very useful .
And it &apos;s not just water that this works with .
You can see the difference .
It &apos;s that afraid of the water .
So what &apos;s going on here ? What &apos;s happening ?
So what are the applications ?
We &apos;ve certainly seen that today .
It could be anti-corrosion .
No water , no corrosion .
It could be anti-bacterial .
Without water , the bacteria won &apos;t survive .
It &apos;s happening !
Dan Ariely : Our buggy moral code
I was burned very badly .
And the nurses told me two things .
This is not just in Hebrew , by the way .
So that &apos;s what I did .
I kept on doing this for a while .
And here &apos;s how it went .
Other people I would tempt to cheat .
I would pass their sheet of paper .
People now solved seven questions on average .
You say , what &apos;s the probability of being caught ?
How much do I stand to gain from cheating ?
And how much punishment would I get if I get caught ?
So , we try to test this .
What about the probability of being caught ?
Some people shredded the whole sheet of paper .
We call this like a personal fudge factor .
Now , how would you test a personal fudge factor ?
Then they shredded it . No cheating whatsoever .
So , all this was about decreasing the fudge factor .
What about increasing the fudge factor ?
No bill ever disappeared .
Think about the following intuition .
These things feel very differently .
Our subjects doubled their cheating .
People see each other behaving .
What does this cause us ?
So , we did another experiment .
The same thing happens .
When we give people the opportunity to cheat , they cheat .
They cheat just by a little bit , all the same .
But in this experiment we also hired an acting student .
That &apos;s it . The task is finished . &quot;
Nobody knew it was an actor .
And they clearly cheated in a very , very serious way .
What would happen to the other people in the group ?
Will they cheat more , or will they cheat less ?
Here is what happens .
Here is the thing .
We ran this at Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh .
It was about the norms for cheating .
So , what have we learned from this about cheating ?
We &apos;ve learned that a lot of people can cheat .
They cheat just by a little bit .
When we remind people about their morality , they cheat less .
Would they not be able to see it this way ?
Of course they would .
The question is , are we going to test those intuitions ?
And I learned two interesting things .
I felt my intuition was correct . &quot;
Thank you very much .
Jane McGonigal : Massively multi-player … thumb-wrestling ?
So thank you , Monochrom .
Sunni , let &apos;s just remind them .
So the first thing we need is more thumbs .
So Eric , come on over .
That is not how you win .
Ah , who did that ? Eric you did that .
We can really go for it .
So you can see up here .
So I think we should kind of get some more involved .
Perfect .
So this is the kind of simple level , right ?
But there are advanced configurations .
This is called the Death Star Configuration .
Any Star Wars fans ?
And this one &apos;s called the Möbius Strip .
Any science geeks , you get that one .
This is the hardest level . This is the extreme .
Thirty seconds . Into the network . Make the node .
Stand up ! It &apos;s easier if you stand up .
Everybody , up up up up up !
Stand up , my friends .
All right .
Don &apos;t start wrestling yet .
Okay . We need to do a last-minute thumb check .
Grab that thumb !
Reach behind you . There you go .
Any other thumbs ?
Try to keep track . Grab , grab , grab it .
Okay ? One , two , three , go !
Well done . Thank you . Thank you very much .
All right .
So curiosity .
I said &quot; massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling . &quot;
So I provoked a little curiosity .
I &apos;m reaching around and I &apos;m reaching up .
So you used creativity . That was great .
You heard that sound go up in the room .
We have relief . You got to stand up .
We had some contentment .
And it &apos;s truly awesome and wondrous .
And the last emotion of pride .
How many people are like me . Just admit it .
You lost both your thumbs .
It just didn &apos;t work out for you .
That &apos;s okay , because you learned a new skill today .
So congratulations .
How many of you won just won thumb ?
All right . I have very good news for you .
So congratulations , grandmasters .
Win one thumb once , you will become a grandmaster .
Did anybody win both their thumbs ?
Yes . Awesome . Okay .
Get ready to update your Twitter or Facebook status .
Pick off the one that looks easiest .
They &apos;re not paying attention . They look kind of weak .
Focus on that one and do something crazy with this arm .
As soon as you win , suddenly stop .
Everybody is thrown off . You go in for the kill .
Thank you for letting me teach you my favorite game .
Wooo !
Thank you .
David Byrne : How architecture helped music evolve
It was , remarkably , a pretty good sounding room .
This is a song that was recorded there .
This is not Talking Heads , in the picture anyway .
The lyrics of the songs could be pretty much understood .
The sound system was kind of decent .
And there wasn &apos;t a lot of reverberation in the room .
So the rhythms could be pretty intact too , pretty concise .
Other places around the country had similar rooms .
This is Tootsie &apos;s Orchid Lounge in Nashville .
The clientele behavior was very much the same too .
And it &apos;s been very exciting .
Is that a kind of model for creativity ?
Okay , Africa .
The music works perfectly in that setting .
It &apos;s no accident .
It &apos;s perfect for that particular context .
In a gothic cathedral , this kind of music is perfect .
It actually improves it .
This is a little bit later .
This is the kind of rooms that Mozart wrote in .
I think we &apos;re in like 1770 , somewhere around there .
It fits the room perfectly .
This is La Scala .
And well , that was an opera experience .
This is the opera house that Wagner built for himself .
And the size of the room is not that big .
It &apos;s smaller than this .
But Wagner made an innovation .
He wanted a bigger band .
Okay .
This is Carnegie Hall .
Obviously , this kind of thing became popular .
The halls got bigger . Carnegie Hall &apos;s fair-sized .
It &apos;s larger than some of the other symphony halls .
And they &apos;re a lot more reverberant than La Scala .
They had to be very quiet .
This is Mahler .
It looks like Bob Dylan , but it &apos;s Mahler .
That was Bob &apos;s last record , yeah .
Popular music , coming along at the same time .
This is a jazz band .
Again , it &apos;s noisy . They &apos;re playing for dancers .
And they &apos;d say , &quot; Play that part again . &quot;
So the bands started to improvise new melodies .
And a new form of music was born .
These are played mainly in small rooms .
People are dancing , shouting and drinking .
&#91; Live music &#93; doesn &apos;t really change that much .
And this was one way that the music got there .
Other singers after him went even further .
This is Chet Baker .
It would have been impossible without recorded music as well .
And he &apos;s singing right into your ear .
He &apos;s whispering into your ears .
The effect is just electric .
So at this point , music diverged .
There &apos;s live music , and there &apos;s recorded music .
And they no longer have to be exactly the same .
So the early hip-hop guys would loop certain sections .
And another new form of music was born .
Musicians who ended up there did the best they could .
The tempos are medium . It sounds big .
It &apos;s more a social situation than a musical situation .
So there &apos;s more new venues .
One of the new ones is the automobile .
I grew up with a radio in a car .
But now that &apos;s evolved into something else .
The car is a whole venue .
Automobile music , you can share with your friends .
Presumably , this is just for Christian music .
So that doesn &apos;t really work .
And does it happen anywhere else ?
So birds do it too .
Yeah . I think it &apos;s evolutionary .
It &apos;s adaptive .
We already know where that passion is going .
But this conflict of views is kind of interesting .
And they &apos;ll vote for that .
We adapt .
We sing .
Thank you very much .
Kevin Breel : Confessions of a depressed comic
That &apos;s the life everyone sees .
But that &apos;s sadness . That &apos;s a natural thing .
That &apos;s a natural human emotion .
It &apos;s a massive problem .
But we don &apos;t see it on social media , right ?
That &apos;s their problem . &quot;
I came this close to doing it .
See , some people might fear girls not liking them back .
Some people might fear sharks . Some people might fear death .
You don &apos;t beat it once and it &apos;s gone forever .
That &apos;s what keeps you from getting help .
That &apos;s what makes you hold it in and hide it .
That &apos;s the stigma .
And I don &apos;t know what the solution is .
We need to speak up and shatter the silence .
You &apos;re wrong , because it &apos;s the opposite .
We &apos;re people , and we have problems .
We &apos;re not perfect , and that &apos;s okay .
And I believe that we can .
I believe that we can . Thank you guys so much .
This is a dream come true . Thank you .
Thank you .
Ronny Edry : Israel and Iran : A love story ?
And I was like , &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
We don &apos;t know people from Iran .
And now people from Iran are talking to me .
So I &apos;m like , whoa .
And everybody &apos;s crying now .
Because it &apos;s working , put me in a poster now .
Tell the Iranians we from Israel love you too . &quot;
It was a huge amount of pictures .
If it &apos;s an image , they may read it .
So here are a few of them .
They have graphic designers . What ?
Crazy , crazy .
So . And now it &apos;s communication .
And it became really big at some point .
And then it became news .
Who is everybody ? &quot; &quot; Everybody . &quot;
They said , &quot; Syria ? &quot; &quot; Syria . &quot;
&quot; Lebanon ? &quot; &quot; Lebanon . &quot;
It &apos;s everybody . &quot; The Chinese .
And we were just at the beginning of the story .
Something crazy also happened .
I give you Iran-Loves-Israel . &quot;
You have Palestine-Loves-Israel .
You have Lebanon that just -- a few days ago .
We really changed how people see the Middle East .
Because you &apos;re not in the Middle East .
And for a few days you got those images .
They see images of us , and they see bad images .
Look at this one . This is the Iran-Loves-Israel page .
This is not the Israel-Loves-Iran . This is not my page .
This is the enemy .
What ?
And it &apos;s going both ways .
And we &apos;re understanding . And you show compassion .
And you become friends .
You can go and travel and meet people .
And I was in Munich a few weeks ago .
And that was the end of it .
Remember that image from the beginning ?
And it goes the other way around .
Just read where those guys are from .
Just people sending their pictures .
Crazy , yes ?
I know how it can look really bad .
And really , we can be our own ambassadors .
We can just send a message and hope for the best .
And maybe that image will help us change something .
Just raise that . Exactly .
Oh my God .
Don &apos;t cry .
Thank you guys .
Charles Moore : Seas of plastic
Let &apos;s talk trash .
Only we humans make waste that nature can &apos;t digest .
Plastics are also hard to recycle .
It &apos;s diddly-point-squat .
That &apos;s the percentage we recycle .
Now , melting point has a lot to do with this .
Notice that the bottles here have caps on them .
but , mostly bottle caps .
We cleaned up the swaths of beach shown .
I offered five cents each for bottle caps .
I got plenty of takers .
Here are the 1,100 bottle caps they collected .
I thought I would spend 20 bucks .
That day I ended up spending nearly 60 .
And this .
Now , you can buy certified organic produce .
This is the legacy we are leaving to future generations .
The throwaway society cannot be contained -- it has gone global .
We simply cannot store and maintain or recycle all our stuff .
We have to throw it away .
All the king &apos;s horses and all the king &apos;s men ...
Anchor : He offers no hope of cleaning it up .
Charles Moore : Thank you .
Carolyn Steel : How food shapes our cities
How do you feed a city ?
It &apos;s one of the great questions of our time .
Yet it &apos;s one that &apos;s rarely asked .
And increasingly these landscapes are not just feeding us either .
And it &apos;s an escalating problem too .
So meat and urbanism are rising hand in hand .
And that &apos;s going to pose an enormous problem .
Six billion hungry carnivores to feed , by 2050 .
We &apos;re very hungry for fossil fuels too .
Half the food produced in the USA is currently thrown away .
None of it makes very much sense .
So how did we get here ?
Because , as you can see , it was crescent shaped .
And it was also fertile .
And in fact , that &apos;s true of every ancient city .
But of course not all of them were that small .
So how did a city like this feed itself ?
The answer is what I call &quot; ancient food miles . &quot;
And the food obviously went off very quickly .
So Rome shaped its hinterland through its appetite .
So the grain markets were to the south of the city .
And the same of course was true for fish .
Which is extraordinary , really , when you think about it .
But also you have to imagine it full of food .
And then 10 years later everything changed .
This is an image of the Great Western in 1840 .
And they &apos;re coming into the city by rail .
And this changes everything .
All of a sudden they are effectively emancipated from geography .
Now it &apos;s anonymous .
We just read the back of a label on a packet .
So instead of trusting it , we fear it .
And instead of valuing it , we throw it away .
So what are we going to do about that ?
It &apos;s not a new question .
500 years ago it &apos;s what Thomas More was asking himself .
This is the frontispiece of his book &quot; Utopia . &quot;
the ordering principle of his vision .
Utopia was actually a word that Thomas Moore used deliberately .
It can either mean a good place , or no place .
I believe we already live in Sitopia .
Well I think it looks a bit like this .
This is where food should be in our society .
By the way , these can be men as well .
We need these people . We &apos;re part of a network .
But networks , markets where food is being grown locally .
It &apos;s common . It &apos;s fresh .
It &apos;s part of the social life of the city .
Cows with a view .
Steaming piles of humus .
This is basically bringing the whole thing together .
And this is a community project I visited recently in Toronto .
It &apos;s a re-conceptualization of the way food shapes our lives .
It &apos;s Ambrogio Lorenzetti &apos;s &quot; Allegory of Good Government . &quot;
It &apos;s about the relationship between the city and the countryside .
And I think the message of this is very clear .
What would an allegory of good government look like today ?
Because I think it &apos;s an urgent question .
We know we are what we eat .
Thank you very much .
Eddi Reader : &quot; Kiteflyer &apos;s Hill &quot;
So this is another one dedicated to that guy ...
who I &apos;ve got over .
But this is &quot; Kiteflyer &apos;s Hill . &quot;
Thank you very much .
Christopher C. Deam : The Airstream , restyled
In fact it appeared like they referenced a mountain cabin .
So that became a challenge .
It &apos;s a compound curve interior .
That &apos;s the trailer , pretty much finished .
The trailers themselves are actually hand-built .
They didn &apos;t want to go to a componentized system .
And there it is , that &apos;s the Bambi 16 .
Elliot Krane : The mystery of chronic pain
Please keep your seat .
A very different feeling .
Now what does it have to do with chronic pain ?
Imagine , if you will , these two ideas together .
In fact , imagine something even worse .
It was cadaverically cold to the touch .
How can the nervous system get this so wrong ?
So people imagine the nervous system is just like that .
These glial cells become activated .
And that &apos;s why pain becomes its own disease .
The nervous system has plasticity .
It changes , and it morphs in response to stimuli .
Well , what do we do about that ?
What can we do in a case like Chandler &apos;s ?
But the future is actually even brighter .
Thank you very much .
Bruce Aylward : How we &apos;ll stop polio for good
Actually , it &apos;s a really big idea .
This is a polio vaccine .
This is a great technology .
We can take it completely for granted .
But it wasn &apos;t always that way .
People were terrified of this disease .
And it was because of scenes like this .
In this scene , people are living in an iron lung .
This disease was terrifying .
There was no cure , and there was no vaccine .
Twenty years later , they succeeded and developed the polio vaccine .
It was hailed as a scientific miracle in the late 1950s .
But this wasn &apos;t the case everywhere in the world .
But the reality is that polio still exists today .
This is the picture .
There &apos;s not very much left in the world .
Hundreds of people were paralyzed .
Hundreds of people died -- children as well as adults .
They had come from thousands of miles away .
And in one case , it originated on another continent .
But the message was very clear .
Polio is still a devastating , explosive disease .
It &apos;s just happening in another part of the world .
We &apos;re not trying to control polio .
So what we &apos;re looking for is a permanent solution .
This virus can only survive in people .
It can &apos;t live for a very long time in people .
It doesn &apos;t survive in the environment hardly at all .
So we are trying to wipe out this virus completely .
So those are the kind of stakes that we &apos;re after .
So it was a massive effort .
Even then , kids need many doses of the vaccine .
With polio it &apos;s almost completely different .
Now giving the polio vaccine is simple .
It &apos;s just two drops , like that .
But reaching 500 million people is much , much tougher .
But one of the most extraordinary is Rotary International .
They &apos;re right at the center of the whole thing .
Last year , it was 1,000 .
We should abandon this idea of eradication .
Let &apos;s settle for control -- that &apos;s good enough . &quot;
There &apos;s absolutely no question .
These are children like Umar .
Umar also has polio .
Umar was paralyzed for life .
His right leg was paralyzed in 2004 .
Umar is an exceptional kid in exceptional circumstances .
The reality of polio today is something very different .
Polio strikes the poorest communities in the world .
We think children deserve better .
And we didn &apos;t start with the easy places .
And yet , the impossible is happening .
India &apos;s not unique .
Now we &apos;re in tough times economically .
Finishing polio eradication is the right thing to do .
Here &apos;s a great idea to spread : End polio now .
Help us tell the story .
Thank you .
Where would you say we need to be the smartest ?
It keeps getting reinfected .
They &apos;re going to be the tough ones .
Now what about the money ?
And is it easy to raise that money ?
B It &apos;s interesting .
That &apos;s what it costs to reach 500 million children .
But right now we don &apos;t have enough of that .
And that great buy costs us a little bit more .
So good luck . We &apos;re all in this with you .
Thank you .
Frank Warren : Half a million secrets
Hi , my name is Frank , and I collect secrets .
It all started with a crazy idea in November of 2004 .
I printed up 3,000 self-addressed postcards , just like this .
But soon the idea began spreading virally .
Soon my crazy idea didn &apos;t seem so crazy .
PostSecret.com is the most visited advertisement-free blog in the world .
And this is my postcard collection today .
I never did have someone . &quot;
Secrets can take many forms .
They can be shocking or silly or soulful .
Maybe one of you sent this one in .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; Dear Birthmother , I have great parents .
I &apos;ve found love . I &apos;m happy . &quot;
&quot; Your mic wasn &apos;t off during sound check .
We all heard you pee . &quot;
Right . You know what I &apos;m saying .
He pays me a lot to keep it a secret . &quot;
It &apos;s in my pocket right now . &quot;
He said , &quot; My knees are still shaking . &quot;
But she finally did .
She got to that bottom secret , his proposal to her .
And he emailed me this picture .
&quot; I found your camera at Lollapalooza this summer .
This one &apos;s my favorite .
&quot; That &apos;s me , my husband and son .
The other pictures are of my very ill grandmother .
Thank you for making your site .
These pictures mean more to me than you know .
My son &apos;s birth is on this camera .
He turns four tomorrow . &quot;
Secrets can take many forms .
They can be shocking or silly or soulful .
Voicemail recording : First saved voice message .
Have a real happy birthday , and I love you .
I &apos;ll say bye for now .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Frank , that was beautiful , so touching .
Have you ever sent yourself a postcard ?
Have you ever sent in a secret to PostSecret ?
I have one of my own secrets in every book .
Has anyone in your life been able to tell ?
Sometimes I share that information , yeah .
Tony Porter : A call to men
This is my two at home , Kendall and Jay .
They &apos;re 11 and 12 .
Kendall &apos;s 15 months older than Jay .
Daddy &apos;s got you . That &apos;s all that &apos;s important .
Hold your head up . Look at me .
Explain to me what &apos;s wrong .
Tell me what &apos;s wrong . I can &apos;t understand you .
Why are you crying ? &quot;
Just go on , go on in your room .
Like a man .
And he &apos;s five years old .
What am I doing ? Why would I do this ? &quot;
And I think back .
I think back to my father .
We lived in New York City , as I said .
And the limousine empties out .
I grew up in tenement buildings in the inner city .
And he was hanging out with all us younger guys .
He was a troubled kid .
His mother had died from a heroin overdose .
He was being raised by his grandmother .
His father wasn &apos;t on the set .
His grandmother had two jobs .
He was home alone a lot .
He was cool . He was fine .
He was having sex .
We all looked up to him .
They called me Anthony growing up as a kid .
&quot; Hey Anthony , come on upstairs . &quot;
Johnny call , you go .
So I run right upstairs .
Now I immediately knew what he meant .
Two things : One , I never had sex .
We don &apos;t talk about that as men .
There ain &apos;t no first time .
Women are objects , especially sexual objects .
Anyway , so I couldn &apos;t tell him any of that .
He told me to go in his room .
She &apos;s 16 years old .
She &apos;s nude .
We had a whole choice of inappropriate names for her .
Anyway , Johnny had just gotten through having sex with her .
So he was offering me the opportunity to do the same .
Folks , I &apos;m petrified .
So now there &apos;s a living room full of guys .
It was like the waiting room in the doctor &apos;s office .
But I knew I felt bad about what was happening .
We see that as an equation that equals violence against women .
I need you on board . I need you with me .
He said to me , &quot; I would be free . &quot;
Thank you folks .
Stanley McChrystal : Listen , learn ... then lead
And you put on the T-10 parachute .
Then you take off .
They give 20 minutes -- that &apos;s a time warning .
You sit there , OK .
Then they give you 10 minutes .
And of course , you &apos;re responding with all of these .
Then they give you , &quot; Get ready . &quot;
Then they go , &quot; Outboard personnel , stand up . &quot;
If you &apos;re an outboard personnel , now you stand up .
If you &apos;re an inboard personnel , stand up .
I &apos;m probably going to jump .
So nice air comes flowing in .
The jumpmasters start to check the door .
Jump is a misnomer ; you fall .
But typically you do ; typically it opens .
Boom .
Now you prepare for the inevitable .
You are going to hit the ground .
You can &apos;t delay that much .
It &apos;s this elegant little land , twist and roll .
And that &apos;s not going to hurt .
In 30-some years of jumping , I never did one .
They &apos;d be doing everything that we had taught them .
When we landed on the drop-zone , everything had changed .
But things had changed ; I was a 46-year-old brigadier general .
And I also was raised with personal examples of leadership .
This was my father in Vietnam .
And I still believe real leaders are like that .
And I &apos;m not sure that was real interaction .
And I had an armored organization at that point .
The enemy didn &apos;t break a sweat doing it .
Sort of leadership by humiliation .
But everything we do is in a different context .
I have to have trust in them and vice versa .
And I also have to build their faith .
And that &apos;s a new kind of leadership for me .
We failed .
The mission didn &apos;t work .
Entirely new requirement .
Also , the people had changed .
And yet , we need to have that shared sense .
And it &apos;s a brand new leadership challenge .
Then another thing .
There &apos;s an effect on you and on your leaders .
There &apos;s an impact , it &apos;s cumulative .
You don &apos;t reset , or recharge your battery every time .
And I remembered his son was in our force .
I said , &quot; Where is he now ? &quot;
Think about knowing that over time .
And it &apos;s a new cumulative pressure on leaders .
And you have to watch and take care of each other .
I probably learned the most about relationships .
I learned they are the sinew which hold the force together .
I grew up much of my career in the Ranger regiment .
It &apos;s a promise .
And every Ranger gets that same promise from every other Ranger .
Think about it . It &apos;s extraordinarily powerful .
It &apos;s probably more powerful than marriage vows .
And so the organizational relationship that bonds them is just amazing .
And I learned personal relationships were more important than ever .
That was my journey .
I hope it &apos;s not over .
This isn &apos;t easy stuff .
And it isn &apos;t always fair .
Thank you .
Arunachalam Muruganantham : How I started a sanitary napkin revolution !
I saw . &quot; What is that ? &quot; I asked .
My wife replied , &quot; None of your business . &quot;
I don &apos;t even use that cloth to clean my two-wheeler .
And it &apos;s called affordability .
Why not make a local sanitary pad for my new wife ?
So only problem : the only available victim is my wife .
Close your eyes . &quot;
Because I tried to make it intimate .
Because it &apos;s an arranged marriage , not a love marriage .
Then other victims , they got into my sisters .
They are having a lot of women volunteers around them .
Why I am not getting &#91; any &#93; ?
Then I used , tried to use the medical college girls .
My God , it &apos;s unbelievable .
You need first funds .
Why is this ? I used medical college girls .
That is my invention .
Why are they coming for , finally , for philanthropy ?
Why the need for accumulating money , then doing philanthropy ?
What if one decided to start philanthropy from the day one ?
Play video one .
Why not make myself a low-cost napkin ?
That is my idea .
They are performing puja .
I make a rural woman to compete with multinationals .
I &apos;m sustaining on seventh year .
Already 600 installations . What is my mission ?
That &apos;s why I &apos;m not running after this bloody money .
I &apos;m doing something serious .
Do your job simply , the girl will chase you .
Like that , I never chased Mahalakshmi .
Not in front pocket . I &apos;m a back pocket man .
I am becoming a solution provider . I &apos;m very happy .
I don &apos;t want to make this as a corporate entity .
Now 110 countries are accessing it . Okay ?
Thank you very much . Bye !
Stephen Hawking : Questioning the universe
There is nothing bigger or older than the universe .
How did the universe come into being ?
Are we alone in the universe ?
Is there alien life out there ?
What is the future of the human race ?
Then it was discovered that the universe was expanding .
Distant galaxies were moving away from us .
This meant they must have been closer together in the past .
This was the Big Bang , the beginning of the universe .
But was there anything before the Big Bang ?
If not , what created the universe ?
The universe can spontaneously create itself out of nothing .
We think we have solved the mystery of creation .
But we don &apos;t know how life first appeared .
This suggests that a probability of life appearing is reasonably high .
I am discounting the reports of UFOs .
Why would they appear only to cranks and weirdoes ?
But we are entering an increasingly dangerous period of our history .
Thank you for listening .
Professor Hawking , thank you for that answer .
Thank you very much indeed .
Amanda Bennett : We need a heroic narrative for death
So I went to a party .
I talk to him for hours .
Only months later , I discover who he really was .
He was the China representative for the American Soybean Association .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand . Soybeans ?
You told me you were a Fulbright scholar . &quot;
I said , &quot; You jerk . &quot;
Only jerk wasn &apos;t the word I used .
I said , &quot; You could &apos;ve gotten me fired . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Let &apos;s get married . &quot;
&quot; Travel the world and have lots of kids . &quot;
So we did .
And for years , it seemed like we were succeeding .
The surgeon emerged from the surgery .
And yet , he did not die .
Mysteriously , he lived on .
He coached Little League for our son .
He built a playhouse for our daughter .
I &apos;m looking for a cure .
So we try another treatment , aggressive , nasty .
Then another year goes by .
Two years go by .
More specialists .
We take the kids to Italy .
We take the kids to Australia .
This time , there &apos;s new treatments on the horizon .
They &apos;re exotic . They &apos;re experimental .
They &apos;re going to attack the cancer in new ways .
So he enters a clinical trial , and it works .
There &apos;s another drug out there .
It &apos;s newer . It &apos;s more powerful .
He started it just two weeks ago .
Perhaps there &apos;s still hope ahead .
So what do I say ?
I say , &quot; Keep him alive if you can . &quot;
And Terence died six days later .
So we fought , we struggled , we triumphed .
We fought together , we lived together .
It was also an expensive fight .
We never got the chance to say goodbye .
We never thought it was the end .
We always had hope .
So what do we make of all of this ?
And what did I discover ?
Yet I had that piece of paper .
We both did .
And they were readily available .
I had them right at hand .
Yet we never got to no further hope .
Now , what do the experts call this ?
They say it &apos;s denial .
It &apos;s a strong word , isn &apos;t it ?
The family won &apos;t listen to reason .
They &apos;re in denial .
How can they insist on this treatment at the end ?
It &apos;s so clear , yet they &apos;re in denial . &quot;
It &apos;s not just families either .
You want to help . You want to fix .
You want to do .
I saw it firsthand .
Days before he died .
It &apos;s not a bug .
It &apos;s a feature .
Maybe I wanted to believe it .
So what do we need ?
Maybe we don &apos;t need a new piece of paper .
People did mention hospice , but I wouldn &apos;t listen .
So I &apos;ll give you a couple lines from him .
This is a poem about Mark Antony .
Actually , one of Cleopatra &apos;s guys .
And he &apos;s been a pretty good general .
The people are leaving . They &apos;re playing instruments .
They &apos;re singing .
And suddenly he knows he &apos;s been defeated .
And the poet tells him what to do .
And isn &apos;t that what we &apos;re missing ?
The overwhelming presence of hope isn &apos;t denial .
Hope isn &apos;t a bug .
It &apos;s a feature .
Thank you .
Juliana Machado Ferreira : The fight to end rare-animal trafficking in Brazil
And in these places they are cared for .
But then what ?
All of these were released by us .
On the top , the turtles are just enjoying freedom .
But it &apos;s still a big issue in Brazil .
We believe we have performed responsible releases .
We &apos;ve registered released animals mating in nature and having chicks .
So , these genes are indeed going back to the populations .
I &apos;m devoting my career to that .
Thank you very much .
Shawn Achor : The happy secret to better work
So we were up on top of our bunk beds .
Did you see how you landed ?
No human lands on all fours like that .
Amy , I think this means you &apos;re a unicorn . &quot;
And the latter won out .
... with one broken leg .
and then we tailor the class right towards the average .
But normal is merely average .
Bobo married Amy the unicorn .
Which , even at Yale , is extraordinarily rare .
When I applied to Harvard , I applied on a dare .
Tuesday night it &apos;s school violence and bullying .
Wednesday night is eating disorders .
Thursday night is elicit drug use .
Silence on the phone .
The absence of disease is not health .
You &apos;re 37 percent better at sales .
Which means we can reverse the formula .
Exercise teaches your brain that your behavior matters .
Thank you very much .
Dan Ariely : What makes us feel good about our work ?
Think about something like mountaineering and mountain climbing .
No , they are full of misery .
I &apos;ll never do it again . &quot;
And he came one day back to campus .
He was working in a big bank .
This was in preparation for a merger and acquisition .
He stayed late at night every day .
And the guy was deeply depressed .
We &apos;ll pay you three dollars for it . &quot;
And people said yes , and they built with these Legos .
If they said yes , we gave them another one .
This was what we called the meaningful condition .
People built one Bionicle after another .
There was another condition .
This other condition was inspired by David , my student .
And this other condition we called the Sisyphic condition .
And if they said yes , they built it .
Now what happens when you compare these two conditions ?
People were not curing cancer or building bridges .
People were building Bionicles for a few cents .
So there was not a real opportunity for big meaning .
But even the small meaning made a difference .
Now we had another version of this experiment .
What happened ?
People predicted the right direction but not the right magnitude .
There was one other piece of data we looked at .
And that &apos;s actually what we found in the meaningful condition .
What happened in the Sisyphic condition ?
In that condition the correlation was zero .
We basically eliminated it .
And everybody raised their hand .
And everybody raised their hand .
And they came up with all kinds of ideas .
The next experiment was slightly different .
That was the task .
And people did the first sheet .
And we had three conditions .
What happened in those three conditions ?
At 15 cents per page , they basically stopped these efforts .
And this is basically the result we had before .
But what about the ignored condition ?
It turns out it was almost like the shredder .
Now there &apos;s good news and bad news here .
Ignoring gets you a whole way out there .
So there is a store in the U.S. called IKEA .
I put things in the wrong way .
I can &apos;t say enjoy those pieces .
I can &apos;t say I enjoy the process .
And there &apos;s an old story about cake mixes .
But it turns out they were very unpopular .
People did not want them .
And they thought about all kinds of reasons for that .
Maybe the taste was not good .
No , the taste was great .
It was as if you bought it in the store .
It didn &apos;t really feel like your own .
So what did they do ?
They took the eggs and the milk out of the powder .
Now you had to break the eggs and add them .
Now it was your cake . Now everything was fine .
So how do we look at this question experimentally ?
We asked people to build some origami .
How much do you want to pay for it ? &quot;
And we had two types of people .
Which one of those two is correct ?
They thought everybody else would love it more as well .
In the next version we tried to do the IKEA effect .
We tried to make it more difficult .
So for some people we gave the same task .
For some people we made it harder by hiding the instructions .
For some people we just eliminated that .
So now this was tougher . What happened ?
Why ? Because now the builders loved it even more .
They put all this extra effort into it .
And evaluators ? They loved it even less .
Because in reality it was even uglier than the first version .
Now think about kids .
Your memories and associations and so on .
But imagine this was slightly different .
And you played with them for a few hours .
How much would you pay for them now ?
Most people say not that much .
Those are really tough .
Let me say one last comment .
He gave an example of a pin factory .
Is efficiency still more important than meaning ?
I think the answer is no .
Thank you very much .
Amy Lockwood : Selling condoms in the Congo
The DRC is a dangerous place .
There are many health issues as well .
Damien runs a hotel outside of Kinshasa .
He said there &apos;s just not in demand .
They like the generics .
And as a marketer , I found that curious .
Sex !
Their marketing is slightly different .
It might just save their lives .
Thank you .
Vicki Arroyo : Let &apos;s prepare for our new climate
This is the skyline of my hometown , New Orleans .
Half the city is already below sea level .
The changes in these times won &apos;t affect us all equally .
And how will they cope in a foreign land ?
It &apos;s already fueled conflicts in Chad and Darfur .
Sure , some are looking for opportunities in this new world .
Their March electricity bill was only 48 dollars .
We need better planning and systems for evacuation .
Second , preparing for heat and drought .
It &apos;s giving them access to affordable credit .
So some solutions to heat can provide for win-win-wins .
Third , adapting to rising seas .
That &apos;s where half of Vietnam &apos;s rice is grown .
Infrastructure is going to be affected .
Airports around the world are located on the coast .
Imagine the staggering cost of protecting this vital infrastructure with levees .
But now , a word of caution .
Adaptation &apos;s too important to be left to the experts .
Why ? Well , there are no experts .
But we can simply no longer rely on established norms .
The larger point I &apos;m trying to make is this .
There are no quick fixes .
There are no one-size-fits-all solutions .
We &apos;re all learning by doing .
But the operative word is doing .
Thank you .
Aubrey de Grey : A roadmap to end aging
I &apos;m going to talk about why defeating aging is desirable .
I &apos;m going to do that in two steps .
So I &apos;m going to start with why we should .
Now , I want to ask a question .
That was easy . OK .
OK . So we all think malaria is a bad thing .
And here is that characteristic .
What part of this do people not understand ?
It &apos;s a global trance .
And that &apos;s true .
That &apos;s my answer to the overpopulation question .
So that &apos;s all I &apos;m going to say about that .
I &apos;m now going to talk about feasibility .
A very simple definition .
Those side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology .
So then , what do we do about that ?
But it isn &apos;t .
That &apos;s the wrong answer .
But after that , things were pretty steady and pretty uniform .
And you see it in all sorts of technologies .
This is a very important point for me to get across .
I &apos;m not saying that at all .
And the same for 300 and 400 and so on .
Well , it seems to get the point across .
You won &apos;t be able to withstand them .
And that &apos;s quite a thought .
I have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation .
And this is what it is .
I say that &apos;s nonsense .
15 years from the robust mouse .
The public &apos;s perception will probably be somewhat better than that .
The public tends to underestimate how difficult scientific things are .
So they &apos;ll probably think it &apos;s five years away .
But it is not part of metabolism itself .
And this turns out to be useful .
Because we can re-draw our original diagram this way .
The engineering approach does not intervene in any processes .
It does not intervene in this process or this one .
The point about this slide is actually the bottom .
This list is just for illustration ; it is incomplete .
The list on the right is also incomplete .
And there are only seven of them .
Of course one can make a biological argument .
We &apos;re made of cells and stuff between cells .
What can damage accumulate in ?
It &apos;s got to be long-lived molecules .
We do need to really start trying .
And we &apos;ll just end with a few things .
And you know what happened .
So , you know , this does happen .
There &apos;s a proposal to actually put together an institute .
This is what &apos;s going to take a bit of money .
Not very long . OK .
Thank you .
The genes don &apos;t care but we do ?
AG : That &apos;s right .
AG : If you lose a bit of weight .
Your numbers are a bit out .
AG : There are technical implications certainly .
Lewis Pugh : My mind-shifting Everest swim
The water is completely black .
It &apos;s flipping freezing in that water .
I heard about this lake , Lake Imja .
So it &apos;s right up in the heavens .
That &apos;s not the worst part of it .
And we walked up this pathway , all the way up .
I could barely breathe .
I was gasping for air .
I have never , ever heard such utter bollocks .
I got myself to the side of the lake .
And my team just gave it to me straight .
Take some time to rest and think about things .
Instead of swimming crawl , swim breaststroke .
And remember , never ever swim with aggression .
This is the time to swim with real humility .
And I swam across the lake .
The warning signs are all there .
And then the second lesson , the radical , tactical shift .
So thank you very , very much .
John Hodgman : Design , explained .
Ah yes , a table .
We use these every day .
And on top of it , the juicy salif .
Okay , what is this object ?
It looks terrible . Is it a little hot plate ?
I don &apos;t get it .
Does anyone know ? Chi ?
It &apos;s an ... iPhone. iPhone .
No , I have an iPhone . Of course I do .
Here is my well-loved iPhone .
I do so many things on this little device .
I like to read books on it .
And yet I forget about it all the time .
Unlike the Theme Building , this is not alien technology .
And you didn &apos;t even notice it happened .
So there you go . My name is John Hodgman .
I just explained design .
Thank you very much .
Lakshmi Pratury : The lost art of letter-writing
So I thought , &quot; I will talk about death . &quot;
Seemed to be the passion today .
Actually , it &apos;s not about death .
That &apos;s what I want to talk about .
Handwriting is a disappearing art .
But too late .
So what do I plan to leave for my son ?
I plan to publish my own notebook .
I took it out for the first time to come here .
Thank you .
Sergey Brin : Why Google Glass ?
Okay , it &apos;s great to be back at TED .
Okay , Glass , record a video .
This is it . We &apos;re on in two minutes .
Okay Glass , hang out with The Flying Club .
Google &quot; photos of tiger heads . &quot; Hmm .
You ready ? You ready ?
Right there . Okay , Glass , take a picture .
Go !
Man 6 : Holy &#91; beep &#93; ! That is awesome .
Whoa ! Look at that snake !
Woman 3 : Okay , Glass , record a video !
Man 7 : After this bridge , first exit .
Man 8 : Okay , A12 , right there !
Man 9 : Google , say &quot; delicious &quot; in Thai .
Woman 4 : Google &quot; jellyfish . &quot;
Man 10 : It &apos;s beautiful .
He needs help getting 10 million dollars .
Should it be by just walking around looking down ?
You &apos;re just kind of moving around .
And also you want something that frees your eyes .
This project has lasted now , been just over two years .
We &apos;ve learned an amazing amount .
It &apos;s been really important to make it comfortable .
So our first prototypes we built were huge .
It was like cell phones strapped to your head .
It was very heavy , pretty uncomfortable .
But we &apos;ve come a long way .
And the other really unexpected surprise was the camera .
Like if I smoked , I &apos;d probably just smoke instead .
Thank you all very much .
Brené Brown : Listening to shame
And she said , &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
I had a slide that said Breakdown .
And she said , &quot; I saw your Talk live-streamed .
It was not really you .
It was a little different than what you usually do .
But it was great . &quot;
And I said , &quot; This can &apos;t happen .
YouTube , they &apos;re putting this thing on YouTube .
And I said , &quot; Let me ask you something . &quot;
And she said , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
And she said , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
And she goes , &quot; Uh ... no . &quot;
That ... me neither . &quot;
Your sisters would be perfect for this . &quot;
I had no contingency plan for four million .
And my life did end when that happened .
But I want to talk about what I &apos;ve learned .
The first is vulnerability is not weakness .
And that myth is profoundly dangerous .
How many of you think of vulnerability and weakness synonymously ?
The majority of people .
Vulnerability is not weakness .
I define vulnerability as emotional risk , exposure , uncertainty .
It fuels our daily lives .
We &apos;d like you to come in and speak .
What would you like for me to talk about ?
There &apos;s three big answers .
To create is to make something that has never existed before .
There &apos;s nothing more vulnerable than that .
Adaptability to change is all about vulnerability .
And I &apos;m going to be really honest with you .
I &apos;ll give you an example .
I &apos;m a fifth generation Texan .
Our family motto is &quot; Lock and load . &quot;
I am not a natural vulnerability researcher .
And then I hear , &quot; Vulnerability TED ! &quot;
I turn around , I go , &quot; Hi . &quot;
&quot; Look away . &quot;
And I see you .
I learned about these things from studying shame .
And so I want to walk you in to shame .
Jungian analysts call shame the swampland of the soul .
And we &apos;re going to walk in .
Here &apos;s why .
Yes ? We heard that .
Yes ?
And all-powerful folks don &apos;t need checklists .
Myshkin Ingawale , I hope I did right by you .
I saw the TED Fellows my first day here .
And he said , &quot; I saw this need .
So you know what I did ? I made it . &quot;
And he said , &quot; And it didn &apos;t work .
You know what the big secret about TED is ?
I can &apos;t wait to tell people this .
I guess I &apos;m doing it right now .
This is like the failure conference .
No , it is .
You know why this place is amazing ?
Because very few people here are afraid to fail .
I &apos;ve failed miserably , many times .
I don &apos;t think the world understands that because of shame .
You &apos;re not good enough .
You never finished that MBA . Your wife left you .
I know those things that happened to you growing up .
Shame is that thing .
Us .
The thing to understand about shame is it &apos;s not guilt .
Shame is &quot; I am bad . &quot;
Guilt is &quot; I did something bad . &quot;
How many of you would be willing to say that ?
Guilt : I &apos;m sorry . I made a mistake .
Shame : I &apos;m sorry . I am a mistake .
There &apos;s a huge difference between shame and guilt .
And here &apos;s what you need to know .
And here &apos;s what you even need to know more .
Guilt , inversely correlated with those things .
It &apos;s uncomfortable , but it &apos;s adaptive .
Everyone sitting in here knows the warm wash of shame .
And it &apos;s a straight-jacket .
Shame is one , do not be perceived as what ?
Weak .
And I said , &quot; I don &apos;t study men . &quot;
And he said , &quot; That &apos;s convenient . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Why ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
So I started interviewing men and asking questions .
Shame is an epidemic in our culture .
Very quickly , some research by Mahalik at Boston College .
And so I &apos;ll leave you with this thought .
And that is seductive .
But the truth is that never happens .
We want you to go in .
We want to be with you and across from you .
So thank you all very much . I really appreciate it .
Eric Whitacre : Virtual Choir Live
I was in the third year of my seven-year undergraduate degree .
I took a couple victory laps in there .
Now fast forward to just three years ago .
Could we do this all in real time ?
Could we have people singing together in real time ?
Now , we &apos;ll perform &quot; Cloudburst &quot; for you .
We deal in milliseconds .
Thank you .
Laura Trice : Remember to say thank you
And I asked myself , why ?
I felt shy , I felt embarrassed .
So , I decided to investigate .
I know a woman who &apos;s good at this .
So , the question is , why was I blocking it ?
Why were other people blocking it ?
I &apos;m telling you where I &apos;m insecure .
I &apos;m telling you where I need your help .
Because what can you do with that data ?
You could neglect me .
You could abuse it .
Or you could actually meet my need .
So , I &apos;m going to challenge all of you .
Go home to your husband -- what does he need ?
And it &apos;s simple .
And why should we care about this ?
We talk about world peace .
So , let &apos;s make it right in our own backyard .
Thank you .
Carter Emmart : A 3D atlas of the universe
This is the WMAP microwave background that we see .
But this our containment of the visible universe .
I know Dr. Carolyn Porco is the camera P.I.
for the Cassini mission .
This software can also be networked between domes .
And we can network between domes and classrooms .
So you &apos;re seeing the edge of the Earth .
This is Nepal .
This is Nepal and Tibet .
We carry that in us .
Thank you .
Esther Perel : The secret to desire in a long-term relationship
That &apos;s the million-dollar question , right ?
And why is the forbidden so erotic ?
What is it about transgression that makes desire so potent ?
And when you love , how does it feel ?
And when you desire , how is it different ?
So what sustains desire , and why is it so difficult ?
Give me comfort , give me edge .
Give me novelty , give me familiarity .
Give me predictability , give me surprise .
So why does good sex so often fade ?
What is the relationship between love and desire ?
How do they relate , and how do they conflict ?
Because therein lies the mystery of eroticism .
We want to neutralize the tensions . We want closeness .
Forgone conclusion does not keep our interest .
In desire , we want a bridge to cross .
Desire needs space .
But then I took a question with me .
Not attracted sexually , per se , but most drawn .
Radiant , as in self-sustaining .
Nobody needs anybody .
There is no caretaking in desire .
Caretaking is mightily loving . It &apos;s a powerful anti-aphrodisiac .
For good reasons , right ?
But basically it &apos;s when there is novelty .
Novelty is , what parts of you do you bring out ?
What parts of you are just being seen ?
So where do you go in sex ?
What parts of you do you connect to ?
What do you seek to express there ?
Is it a place for transcendence and spiritual union ?
Is it a place where you can express your infantile wishes ?
What comes out there ? It &apos;s a language .
It isn &apos;t just a behavior .
You know , animals have sex .
But the central agent is really that piece called the imagination .
They knew how to keep themselves alive .
And so I began to ask a different question .
And then I began to ask the reverse question .
You know , the erotic mind is not very politically correct .
My partner hasn &apos;t taken care of me in so long .
I will lose my freedom in order not to lose connection .
Translate this into adult language .
&quot; Are you going to be there ?
Are you going to be angry with me ? &quot;
The third child doesn &apos;t really come back .
One , they have a lot of sexual privacy .
Foreplay pretty much starts at the end of the previous orgasm .
Responsibility and desire just butt heads .
They don &apos;t really do well together .
Erotic couples also understand that passion waxes and wanes .
But what they know is they know how to resurrect it .
Committed sex is premeditated sex .
It &apos;s willful . It &apos;s intentional .
It &apos;s focus and presence .
Merry Valentine &apos;s .
Nalini Nadkarni : Life science in prison
Trees epitomize stasis .
I simply tied the end of a paintbrush onto a twig .
You might have a guess .
And our prison system itself is stuck .
The United States has over 2.3 million incarcerated men and women .
That number is rising .
That , I think , is movement .
That , I think , is movement .
That , I think , is movement .
Thank you very much .
Sleepy Man Banjo Boys : Bluegrass virtuosity from ... New Jersey ?
Robbie Mizzone : Thank you .
Tommy Mizzone : Thank you very much .
TM : Thank you very much .
On guitar is my 15-year-old brother Tommy .
On banjo is 10-year-old Jonny .
He &apos;s also our brother .
So you can probably piece the rest together .
It might have been that it weighs about a million pounds .
TM : Thank you very much .
RM : Thank you .
Michael Hansmeyer : Building unimaginable shapes
If we could free ourselves from our education ?
What would these unseen forms look like ?
Would they surprise us ? Would they intrigue us ?
Would they delight us ?
I propose we look to nature .
Nature has been called the greatest architect of forms .
We can abstract them and to create something that is new .
We &apos;re free to choose where we make the fold .
And by doing so , we can differentiate the surfaces .
And in doing so , we can suddenly fold anything .
A simple volume , the cube .
And we can play with this .
We can begin to sculpt the form .
We can make folds that we otherwise could not make .
Surfaces can become porous .
They can stretch . They can tear .
But in each case , I didn &apos;t design the form .
I designed the process that generated the form .
White surfaces have long edges , black ones have short ones .
So let &apos;s bring this process to architecture .
How ? And at what scale ?
I chose to design a column .
Columns are architectural archetypes .
I started using four cylinders .
And these columns , they have information at very many scales .
We can begin to zoom into them .
The closer one gets , the more new features one discovers .
Some formations are almost at the threshold of human visibility .
These forms are undrawable .
In this case , the process is deterministic .
So this leads to a new role for the architect .
But enough of the theory .
There &apos;s been a lot of talk now about 3D printing .
But it was very labor intensive .
But it is increasingly possible .
These are images from the Gwangju Biennale .
Each column is effectively a hybrid of two columns .
So where does this leave us ?
In short , we have no constraints .
Thank you .
David Hoffman : Sputnik mania
The rocket was huge .
On October 4 , 1957 , they launched their rocket .
Now we have the good fortune to open up space .
For days after the launch , Sputnik was a wonderful curiosity .
All hell broke loose .
It provoked the missile gap .
It exploded an arms race .
It began the space race .
And the reactions to Sputnik went far beyond weapons increases .
But Sputnik provoked wonderful changes as well .
&quot; Sputnik &quot; will soon be released .
And I &apos;d like to thank you all .
Thank you , Chris .
Harish Manwani : Profit &apos;s not always the point
Of not just creating economic value but creating social value .
And that model is all about doing well and doing good .
But the question is easier said than done .
But how do we actually get that done ?
There are things that you stand for .
I joined Unilever in 1976 as a management trainee in India .
You &apos;re here to change lives .
You know , I thought it was rather facetious .
We are a company that sells soap and soup .
What are we doing about changing lives ?
We run the largest hand-washing program in the world .
And brands indeed can be at the forefront of social change .
Small actions can make a big difference .
We have 60,000 such women now in India .
Small actions , big difference .
So just think about it .
There are small actions that can make a big difference .
And I can go on and on .
Thank you very much .
Susan Cain : The power of introverts
Because in my family , reading was the primary group activity .
Camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol .
Rowdie , rowdie , let &apos;s get rowdie . &quot;
Yeah .
I did my best .
And I felt kind of guilty about this .
Now , I tell you this story about summer camp .
It &apos;s different from being shy .
Shyness is about fear of social judgment .
But now here &apos;s where the bias comes in .
And kids are working in countless group assignments .
Okay , same thing is true in our workplaces .
I &apos;ll give you some examples .
So no wilderness , no revelations .
So ...
And do you really want to leave it up to chance ?
One answer lies deep in our cultural history .
And they feature as their role models really great salesmen .
So that &apos;s the world we &apos;re living in today .
That &apos;s our cultural inheritance .
Guess what ?
Books .
I have a suitcase full of books .
Here &apos;s Margaret Atwood , &quot; Cat &apos;s Eye . &quot;
Here &apos;s a novel by Milan Kundera .
But these are not exactly my books .
And people would come from all over to hear him speak .
But here &apos;s the thing about my grandfather .
So I prepared for moments like these as best I could .
And I call this my &quot; year of speaking dangerously . &quot;
And that actually helped a lot .
I mean , we are .
Number one : Stop the madness for constant group work .
Just stop it .
Thank you .
That is great .
It &apos;s great for introverts and it &apos;s great for extroverts .
School , same thing .
This is especially important for extroverted children too .
Okay , number two : Go to the wilderness .
Be like Buddha , have your own revelations .
So extroverts , maybe your suitcases are also full of books .
Or maybe they &apos;re full of champagne glasses or skydiving equipment .
And that &apos;s okay .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you .
Yves Behar : Designing objects that tell stories
And then there was another influence .
Those are pretty good escapes from the drab weather in Switzerland .
And I realized then I had to go to design school .
I mean , look at those graphics there .
&quot; You know , do people really use it ?
And I didn &apos;t want to be a colorist .
It wasn &apos;t what I wanted to do .
I didn &apos;t want to be a stylist in this way .
And what I wanted to work on is important stuff .
And then finally , the leaf lamp for Herman Miller .
So , the light bulb actually does that .
But designers are really the glue that brings these things together .
And this is what we &apos;re pursuing here .
But how we work on Jawbone is really unique .
I want to point at something here , on the left .
It &apos;s really about designing from the inside out .
And it &apos;s what I call being design driven .
And then , of course , design is never done .
And here &apos;s another project , another partnership-type approach .
And this allows the bottle to turn into a game .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s another project , which I think really emulates that .
This picture is incredible .
I mean , to me , it just means so much .
But the third pillar that he talked about was design .
I didn &apos;t really want to , from the previous adventure .
They fought the suppliers , they fought the manufacturers .
And I think this is something really important .
And we went away from obviously the beige .
I mean it &apos;s colorful , it &apos;s fun .
Like paper , paper and cardboard .
These are the dispensers . There &apos;s this friendly shape .
And we also designed the condoms themselves .
Of course , clubs and discos , too .
And here &apos;s the public service announcement for this project .
Get some .
So , thank you .
Paul Root Wolpe : It &apos;s time to question bio-engineering
We altered our ecological niche by creating civilization .
Now we actually have been doing it for a long time .
Dogs are the result of selectively breeding traits that we like .
We don &apos;t have to do it that way anymore .
This is a beefalo .
A beefalo is a buffalo-cattle hybrid .
This is a geep , a goat-sheep hybrid .
I think they said it tasted like chicken .
This is a cama .
And they are now using these in certain cultures .
Then there &apos;s the liger .
It &apos;s bigger than a tiger .
And then finally , everybody &apos;s favorite , the zorse .
None of this is Photoshopped . These are real creatures .
But something much , much more powerful is happening now .
We all know that some deep-sea creatures glow .
These are normal cells .
So they did it with mouse pups , kittens .
They did it with pigs .
They did it with puppies .
And , in fact , they did it with monkeys .
Be easier to find us at night .
These are zebra fish . They &apos;re normally black and silver .
Other states have banned them .
Nobody knows what to do with these kinds of creatures .
These are all the first cloned animals of their type .
This is Prometea , the first cloned horse .
The guar is an endangered Southeast Asian ungulate .
We have two kinds of DNA in our bodies .
That DNA is passed down through our mothers .
These are really hybrids , not pure animals .
This lovely creature is an Asian cockroach .
They &apos;ve created a kind of insect bot , or bugbot .
It gets worse than that -- or perhaps better than that .
These goliath beetles are wired in their wings .
They can &apos;t actually make them land .
But it &apos;s the closest they can get to a landing .
It &apos;s not just insects .
The scientists can make this creature go left , right .
They &apos;ve now created an organic robot .
We &apos;ve taken away the autonomy of this animal . &quot;
I &apos;ll get back to that in a minute .
There &apos;s also been work done with monkeys .
This is Miguel Nicolelis of Duke .
This is Thomas DeMarse at the University of Florida .
They self-aggregated into a network , became an integrated chip .
This is a brain from a lamprey eel .
It &apos;s photophilic .
So now we have a complete living lamprey eel brain .
Genetic engineering coupled with polymer physiotechnology coupled with xenotransplantation .
This is where we are in this process .
This is what Frankenstein &apos;s lab looks like .
And so , we need to ask ourselves some questions .
Is everything okay ?
Is it okay to manipulate and create whatever creatures we want ?
Do we have free reign to design animals ?
It &apos;s already happening . It &apos;s not science fiction .
We are now taking control of our own evolution .
Thanks .
Péter Fankhauser : Meet Rezero , the dancing ballbot
Let me introduce to you Rezero .
Our robot belongs to a family of robots called Ballbots .
This means that the robot is inherently unstable .
Now we &apos;ll explain that in a second .
Let me first explain how Rezero actually keeps his balance .
Let &apos;s play a little .
In this mode , he &apos;s trying to maintain his position .
I can also make him spin .
He &apos;s now keeping a constant distance to Thomas .
We call this the orbiting mode .
All right , thank you , Thomas .
Now , what &apos;s the use of this technology ?
Rezero could be used in exhibitions or parks .
And these are more practical applications .
But there &apos;s also a certain beauty within this technology .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Do you know which group you &apos;re in ?
If you don &apos;t , you &apos;re not alone .
Because the breast has become are very political organ .
But first , my disclosures .
I am not a breast cancer survivor .
I &apos;m not a radiologist .
She came to see me after discovering a breast lump .
Her sister had been diagnosed with breast cancer in her 40s .
Fortunately , her lump proved to be benign .
Radiologists were outraged by the guidelines .
But in my view , the radiologists are heroes .
But that very fact is telling .
The factor most responsible for that fire is breast density .
And that proportion is primarily genetically determined .
So how do you know if your breasts are dense ?
And breasts that fall into these two categories are considered dense .
But what else could I offer her ?
What about ultrasound ?
Think about iPods compared to stereos .
But it &apos;s the exact opposite in health care .
The machines get ever bigger and ever more expensive .
It &apos;s just way too much equipment .
One MRI scan costs 10 times what a digital mammogram costs .
It &apos;s like the essence of TED .
This is an image from our first patient .
This is our current detector .
And you can see that it looks a lot different .
So how does this work ?
But with MBI , we use just light , pain-free compression .
And the detector then transmits the image to the computer .
So here &apos;s an example .
Our big break came in 2004 .
MBI found 83 percent .
Here &apos;s an example from that screening study .
In this case , a one-centimeter tumor .
So this is not just young women that it &apos;s benefiting .
It &apos;s also older women with dense tissue .
MBI generates four images per breast .
MRI generates over a thousand .
First , know your density .
Of course we should .
We need to individualize screening based on density .
For women without dense breasts , mammography is the best choice .
Thank you .
Pranav Mistry : The thrilling potential of SixthSense technology
We grew up interacting with the physical objects around us .
It comes as a part of our everyday learning .
It had some strings and pulleys and some springs .
What we are interested in is information .
We want to know about things .
We want to know about dynamic things going around .
The camera is actually tracking all your gestures .
You can start painting on any wall .
But we are not only tracking one finger , here .
Thank you .
This was Obama &apos;s visit last week to MIT .
But the camera is actually tracking where my fingers are moving .
You can of course watch movies .
And why only computers ? We can just play with papers .
Paper world is interesting to play with .
That &apos;s all . Thank you .
Thank you .
This is incredible , really .
Or is this research forever , or what ?
Open source ? Wow .
PM : Yeah . Yes , yes , of course .
What are your plans ? MIT ?
It &apos;s an honor to have you at TED .
Thank you so much .
That &apos;s fantastic .
Kevin Stone : The bio-future of joint replacement
So let me just start with my story .
And it &apos;s not just aging that causes arthritis .
Let &apos;s consider an alternative path .
I &apos;m not ready for joint replacement . &quot;
And &#91; the allograft &#93; replaces &#91; the missing meniscus &#93; .
And so we can regrow these surfaces biologically .
Well the reason is because there &apos;s not enough donor cycles .
And the tissue &apos;s very expensive .
So my story in working with animal tissues starts in 1984 .
And that &apos;s great when I can degrade the tissue .
I can &apos;t grind it up in a blender .
And we call that a &quot; gal stripping &quot; technique .
What we do is humanize the tissue .
So what about the next step ?
How are we going to revolutionize artificial joint replacement ?
Well here &apos;s how we &apos;re going to do it .
So that &apos;s our biologic approach right now .
We &apos;re going to rebuild your knee with the parts .
We &apos;re going to resurface it with a completely new surface .
But we have other advantages from the animal kingdom .
There &apos;s a benefit of 400 million years of ambulation .
We can harness those benefits .
We can do it as an outpatient procedure .
And so welcome to super biologics .
It &apos;s not hardware .
It &apos;s not software .
It &apos;s bioware .
It &apos;s version 2.0 of you .
Thank you very much .
Marcel Dicke : Why not eat insects ?
That &apos;s quite a lot .
Because there &apos;s 80 percent out there that really eats insects .
But this is quite good .
Why not eat insects ? Well first , what are insects ?
Insects are animals that walk around on six legs .
And here you see just a selection .
It was 80 billion U.S. dollars .
Well we know that that was not a cheap war .
What do they do ?
They remove dung , they pollinate our crops .
They control pests , and they &apos;re food for animals .
They &apos;re at the start of food chains .
Small animals eat insects .
Even larger animals eat insects .
There &apos;s quite a lot of people that are eating insects .
And they prepare it in a wonderful way .
And you can eat something new everyday .
More than 1,000 species -- an enormous variety .
You &apos;re eating at least 500 grams per year .
What are you eating ?
Some fruits get some insect damage .
And that &apos;s your view of a tomato .
So anything is a good protein source already .
We &apos;re even doing this on purpose .
One gram of cochineal costs about 30 euros .
One gram of gold is 30 euros .
The human population is growing very rapidly and is growing exponentially .
How are we going to feed this world ?
And we eat quite a lot of it .
In the developing world it &apos;s much lower .
It &apos;s 25 kilograms per person per year .
But it &apos;s increasing enormously .
They have the same share that we have .
You &apos;ll get proteins in any kind of food anyway .
The first problem that we &apos;re facing is human health .
Pigs are quite like us .
That means that pigs also share diseases with us .
You get a new disease that can be deadly .
So that &apos;s one point for insects .
And there &apos;s the conversion factor .
We &apos;re not taking the bonus yet .
We &apos;re not taking the nine kilograms of output yet .
So that &apos;s two points for insects .
And there &apos;s the environment .
So less waste .
So that &apos;s three points for insects .
And even in terms of calories , it is very good .
So that &apos;s four points for insects .
So the question is , why not eat insects ?
I gave you at least four arguments in favor .
We &apos;ll have to .
On the right-hand side you see a grasshopper .
It &apos;s just very good food .
You can vary enormously .
It has many benefits .
Who wouldn &apos;t like to eat a shrimp ?
They are delicacies .
So why are we not eating insects yet ?
Well that &apos;s just a matter of mindset .
That &apos;s why we &apos;re changing the perception of insects .
If we die out , the insects will continue very happily .
And some might think , well they &apos;re not yet available .
Well they are .
And they &apos;re being made in the most wonderful ways .
A Dutch chocolate maker .
So there &apos;s even a lot of design to it .
And when she got all the Ministers of Agriculture of the E.U.
It &apos;s not something that is a hobby of mine .
It &apos;s really taken off the ground .
So why not eat insects ?
You should try it yourself .
Look at them first . Look at them first .
Marcel Dicke : It &apos;s all protein .
And it looks delicious .
They just make it &#91; with &#93; nuts or something .
MD : Thank you .
Cameron Sinclair : The refugees of boom-and-bust
1.1 million of them .
They pay a middle-man thousands of dollars to be there .
And then the financial collapse happened .
Currently , right now , thousands of workers are abandoned .
There is no way back home .
And there is no way , and no proof of arrival .
These are the boom-and-bust refugees .
So let &apos;s forget your environmental footprint .
Let &apos;s think about your ethical footprint .
Thank you .
Kevin Surace : Eco-friendly drywall
What &apos;s happening to the climate ?
It is unbelievably bad .
So we all look at what we can do .
Only nine percent is passenger cars , interestingly enough .
So we ran off to a sushi bar .
And it was something called EcoRock .
We started R &amp; amp ; D in 2006 .
Decided to use recycled content from cement and steel manufacturing .
And they worked absolutely very , very , very hard .
We did the line install over the summer .
We started right there , with absolutely nothing .
That &apos;s the finished production line there .
We got our first panel out on December third .
But this has a huge , huge impact on the environment .
And we &apos;ve got Cradle-to-Cradle Gold on this thing .
Thank you . Thank you .
We must change everything .
We &apos;re going as fast as we can .
Those are my kids , Natalie and David .
Thank you so much .
Shigeru Ban : Emergency shelters made from paper
Hi . I am an architect .
Then I built the temporary structure , 1990 .
This is the first temporary building made out of paper .
So it &apos;s very useful .
Year 2000 , there was a big expo in Germany .
My goal of the design is not when it &apos;s completed .
After , the building was recycled .
So that was the goal of my design .
We stayed there for six years without paying any rent .
Thank you . I had one big problem .
That was the problem .
Then I completed the Pompidou Center in Metz .
They have money and power .
Those are invisible .
But I must say they are no longer natural disasters .
That &apos;s the responsibility of architects .
We can make it better .
So that is why I started working in disaster areas .
1994 , there was a big disaster in Rwanda , Africa .
Two tribes , Hutu and Tutsi , fought each other .
Over two million people became refugees .
But over two million people cut trees .
It just became big , heavy deforestation and an environmental problem .
That is why they started providing aluminum pipes , aluminum barracks .
And he said , &quot; Oh God , are you crazy ?
After a fire , what are you proposing ? &quot;
So I proposed to rebuild . I raised -- did fundraising .
The color coordination is very important .
So I remember it was so disappointing .
Finally the priest , finally he trusted me to rebuild .
So we spent five weeks rebuilding the church .
It stayed there in Taiwan as a permanent church even now .
So this building became a permanent building .
2001 , in West India , I built also a shelter .
I was asked to rebuild the temporary church .
I brought my Japanese students to work with the Chinese students .
And they are very kind , affording my model .
And I was very lucky .
But look at this . There &apos;s no privacy .
People suffer mentally and physically .
But it &apos;s really necessary to do it .
So I proposed to the mayor while I was making partitions .
Many of the people want to stay here forever .
I was very happy to hear that .
Now I am working in New Zealand , Christchurch .
And I was asked to come to rebuild the temporary cathedral .
So this is under construction .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Neil Burgess : How your brain tells you where you are
Here &apos;s the problem facing Homer .
Place cells are also being recorded in humans .
And when you expand the box , the firing location expands .
But we also know where we are through movement .
Do people have grid cells ?
So back to Homer .
And that would be represented by the firing of boundary-detecting cells .
Maybe it &apos;s been towed .
And grid cells could move this viewpoint through that space .
Thank you very much .
Nigel Marsh : How to make work-life balance work
We should stop looking outside .
I &apos;m talking about all companies .
Have sex .
Walk the dog .
Have breakfast with my wife and children .
Have sex again .
Drive the kids to school on the way to the office .
Do three hours &apos; work .
Play a sport with a friend at lunchtime .
Do another three hours &apos; work .
Meet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink .
Drive home for dinner with my wife and kids .
Meditate for half an hour .
Have sex .
Walk the dog . Have sex again .
Go to bed .
How often do you think I have that day ?
We need to be realistic .
You can &apos;t do it all in one day .
There &apos;s got to be a middle way .
And I realize that my life is completely out of balance .
It &apos;s totally dominated by work .
All of my relationships have failed .
There &apos;s nothing in my life apart from my work .
So I joined a gym . &quot;
Now that can be daunting .
And I understand .
I truly understand how that can be daunting .
Now my point is the small things matter .
Being more balanced doesn &apos;t mean dramatic upheaval in your life .
Moreover , I think , it can transform society .
And that , I think , is an idea worth spreading .
Sam Harris : Science can answer moral questions
&quot; What is worth dying for ? &quot;
&quot; What constitutes a good life ? &quot;
But I think this is quite clearly untrue .
Values are a certain kind of fact .
They are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures .
Why don &apos;t we feel compassion for rocks ?
Would adding cholera to the water be a good idea ?
Probably not .
And morality relates to these truths .
So , in talking about values we are talking about facts .
And these await our discovery .
We &apos;re not talking about Connecticut .
And the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious .
Well , consider by analogy , the concept of physical health .
The concept of physical health is undefined .
It &apos;s now around 80 in the developed world .
People will send you donations when you &apos;re in that condition .
Now , why wouldn &apos;t this undermine an objective morality ?
There is clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food .
But there &apos;s nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison .
Why would we think this ?
Consider , by analogy , the game of chess .
But it clearly admits some exceptions .
And yet , chess is a domain of perfect objectivity .
Well , who are we not to say this ?
What are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing ?
Now , what stands in the way of this ?
He likes chocolate , he likes vanilla .
Notice that we don &apos;t do this in science .
On the left you have Edward Witten .
He &apos;s a string theorist .
I &apos;m not a fan . &quot;
I &apos;m the Ted Bundy of string theory .
But this is just the point .
Whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded .
That is what it is to have a domain of expertise .
That is what it is for knowledge to count .
How have we convinced ourselves that every opinion has to count ?
Just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality .
Thank you very much .
So , some combustible material there .
Language seems to be really important here .
But can you reconcile that ?
So , everything is not going to be up for grabs .
Do people love their daughters just as much in these systems ?
And I think there are clearly right answers to that .
SH : Really an honor . Thank you .
Kathryn Schulz : On being wrong
My friend looks at me totally blankly .
And what I &apos;m talking about is this .
Right , the famous Chinese character for picnic area .
We get it in the abstract .
We all know everybody in this room makes mistakes .
I think this is a problem .
And second , why it &apos;s such a problem .
Dreadful . Thumbs down .
Embarrassing . Okay , wonderful , great .
But just being wrong doesn &apos;t feel like anything .
I &apos;ll give you an analogy .
That &apos;s when he falls .
So I should actually correct something I said a moment ago .
I call this error blindness .
Think back for a moment to elementary school .
This is not mine , by the way .
We learn these really bad lessons really well .
Right , Mr. CFO , astrophysicist , ultra-marathoner ?
Okay , so fine .
So let me tell you a story .
Beth Israel &apos;s in Boston .
Everything seems to have gone fine .
So this is a huge practical problem .
But it &apos;s also a huge social problem .
Think for a moment about what it means to feel right .
So this is a catastrophe .
And yeah , it is also why we get things wrong .
It &apos;s totally fundamental to who we are .
And my first thought was , &quot; I &apos;ve lost it .
I &apos;ve become the crazy wrongness lady .
I just imagined it everywhere , &quot; which has happened .
When it comes to our stories , we love being wrong .
And something else happened instead .
And something else happened instead .
And something else happened instead .
And something else happened instead .
I mean , this is life .
Didn &apos;t really work out that way , did it ?
Where &apos;s my jet pack , Chris ?
So here we are again .
And that &apos;s how it goes .
We come up with another idea .
We tell another story .
We hold another conference .
Maybe I &apos;m wrong . &quot;
Thank you .
Thank you guys .
Neil MacGregor : 2600 years of history in one object
It doesn &apos;t , I agree , look very much .
It &apos;s about the size of a rugby ball .
And you all know roughly the story .
Not only the Jews , he &apos;d taken the temple vessels .
He &apos;d ransacked , desecrated the temple .
Belshazzar , his son , decides to have a feast .
And Cyrus makes a declaration .
They &apos;re not shy of hyperbole as you can see .
So the hyperbole is not actually surprising .
He &apos;ll let them return to their countries .
It &apos;s a central document in Jewish history .
This is the Jewish version of the same story .
Who is there among you of his people ?
Two great texts , what about the politics ?
Cyrus begins in the 530s BC .
It was the largest empire the world had known until then .
And it had to be run in a quite new way .
It had to be run in different languages .
The fact that this decree is in Babylonian says one thing .
All of those are respected by Cyrus .
The Greek invasions ended that .
But what Cyrus represented remained absolutely central .
And throughout European culture afterward , Cyrus remained the model .
And it enters now another story .
No other evidence .
Suddenly , this appeared .
It &apos;s a great 19th century moment .
It can only be Jehovah .
The question is , which god was it ?
That &apos;s 1879 .
You all know what happened .
And another story of the cylinder begins .
Cyrus cylinder : guarantor of the Shah .
10 years later , another story : Iranian Revolution , 1979 .
Then another Iran-Iraq war .
And the obvious emblem is Cyrus .
It &apos;s the only object they want .
They want to borrow the Cyrus cylinder .
It was a huge event .
This is the other side of that same picture .
This is beyond any blockbuster exhibition in the West .
Is Iran still to be the defender of the oppressed ?
It was a narrative presented by the president himself .
It stands with the American constitution .
It certainly says far more about real freedoms than Magna Carta .
A replica of this is at the United Nations .
Thank you .
Joshua Klein : A thought experiment on the intelligence of crows
Any of you get really freaked out by that ?
You might want to leave now .
So , this is a vending machine for crows .
We gotta kill them because they &apos;re making a mess .
And he said that was impossible .
So I did .
They &apos;d become extremely adept at living with us .
And in doing so , we were breeding them for parasitism .
So , for example , rats are incredibly responsive breeders .
And so I built the vending machine .
We &apos;re seeing a population boom with crows .
So that &apos;s no great surprise .
And I &apos;ll give you an example of that .
So this is Betty . She &apos;s a New Caledonian crow .
But the researchers had a problem .
And she hadn &apos;t had the opportunity to do this before .
You see , it wasn &apos;t working very well .
So she adapted .
But she did it all on her own .
So keep in mind that she &apos;s never seen this done .
Right .
Yeah . All right .
That &apos;s the part where the researchers freak out .
It &apos;s pretty annoying for the fishermen .
And the next month . And after summer break .
So -- the moral being , don &apos;t piss off crows .
It &apos;s fairly interesting .
Wait for the light to stop the traffic .
Then , collect your cracked nut in safety .
Joshua Klein : Yeah , yeah . Pretty interesting .
In fact , that &apos;s old hat for crows .
Parents seem to be teaching their young .
The point being that they &apos;ve developed cultural adaptation .
So we know that there &apos;s lots of crows .
So that &apos;s what we did .
This is a vending machine for crows .
It &apos;s pretty simple .
And eventually , they eat up all the peanuts .
Then you can come back anytime and get yourself a peanut .
And so this goes on for some time .
Come back , look for the peanut , go away .
They figure it &apos;s gotta have more to it .
And then , we &apos;re off to the races .
Instead , I think we should look a little bit larger .
I think that crows can be trained to do other things .
Or find expensive components from discarded electronics ?
Or maybe do search and rescue ?
Thanks very much .
David Logan : Tribal leadership
Now , I want to tell you a quick story .
We &apos;ll go back a little more than a year .
It was February 3rd , 2008 .
Anyone remember what happened , February 3rd , 2008 ?
And they had discussed things of great national importance .
Like , &quot; Do we like the Budweiser commercial ? &quot;
All of you are members of tribes .
That is in fact what great tribal leaders do .
So here is the bottom line .
And so people form tribes .
They always have . They always will .
But here &apos;s the rub .
Now here is the net out of this .
You &apos;re all a member of tribes .
Now , this is the lowest of the stages .
You don &apos;t want this . Okay ?
Stage One produces people who do horrible things .
This is the kid who shot up Virginia Tech .
It &apos;s not enough to simply write people off .
But let &apos;s move on to Stage Two .
It will be despairing hostility .
Actually , no , I &apos;m not .
But I &apos;m saying the culture makes people dumb .
You find them in all places in society .
What kind of innovation would get done ?
The amount of world-changing behavior that would happen ?
In fact it would be basically nil .
Because it is in Stage Three that many of us move .
And we park . And we stay .
I &apos;m great and you &apos;re not .
And the elevator door opened , and they all walked out .
That is a meeting of a Stage Three tribe .
Like , oh , I don &apos;t know , TEDx USC .
Here is the greatest challenge we face in innovation .
It is moving from Stage Three to Stage Four .
Let &apos;s take a look at a quick video snippet .
It was not Christmas time . There was a Christmas tree .
This is their lobby .
Employees volunteer time in the advice booth .
Notice it looks like something out of a Peanuts cartoon .
Okay , we &apos;re going through the hallway here at Zappos .
This is a call center . Notice how it &apos;s decorated .
Notice people are applauding for us .
But you &apos;ll notice the level of excitement .
Notice , again , how they decorate their office .
But they value things like fun . And they value creativity .
And you &apos;ll notice they are a little bit weird .
Stage Four tribes can do remarkable things .
There is , in fact , another stage .
In fact , South Africa has not gone down that road .
We &apos;re great ! Who is not great ? England ! &quot;
Sorry .
Well , what about other great leaders ? What about Gandhi ?
What about Martin Luther King ?
Just one little bit of happiness and joy after another .
Two percent are at Stage One .
And our values are beginning to unite us . &quot;
And those are the ones that change the world .
I &apos;d like to show you some examples of this .
And he grew up essentially in Stage One .
I don &apos;t know anybody .
In fact , that &apos;s progress .
So , what about moving from Stage Three to Stage Four ?
I want to argue that we &apos;re doing that right here .
That &apos;s called a triadic relationship .
See , people who build world-changing tribes do that .
And ultimately that adds to their values .
You know they do polls , right ?
Pretty much everybody else who does polls .
So , they were bored .
And they found a way to do the first-ever world poll .
Incidentally , they did pull it off .
And they released the first-ever world poll .
So I &apos;d like to leave you with these thoughts .
You remember to talk all five culture stages .
Because we &apos;ve got people in all five , around us .
Thank you very much .
Frederick Balagadde : Bio-lab on a microchip
This is the most devastating epidemic of our time .
This is already beginning to happen in Sub-Saharan Africa .
I experienced this firsthand as a high school student in Uganda .
We all know about the miracle of miniaturization .
This is a microfluidic chip that I developed .
Thank you very much .
Jonathan Drori : The beautiful tricks of flowers
Do you know how many species of flowering plants there are ?
And flowers are a real bugger .
They &apos;re really difficult for plants to produce .
Why would they go to that bother ?
Evolution works that way .
Now the way that plants transmit that information is through pollen .
Some of you may have seen some of these pictures before .
And that &apos;s actually rather useful for forensics and so on .
There are markings on many plants that look like other insects .
And they get up to all sorts of tricks .
They have to try and attract pollinators to do their bidding .
And sure enough , there &apos;s the insect .
Now this is a plant .
And this is the mimic .
So this is a plant that is mimicking the first plant .
Now deceit carries on through the plant kingdom .
Sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect , even to us .
It &apos;s a wonderful , amazing thing .
This one &apos;s clever . It &apos;s called obsidian .
I think of it as insidium sometimes .
And this one doesn &apos;t have anything for them .
So it &apos;s deceiving on two levels -- fabulous .
Here we see ylang ylang , the component of many perfumes .
I actually smelt someone with some on earlier .
And the flowers don &apos;t really have to be that gaudy .
This one doesn &apos;t smell so good .
So flies love this .
They fly in and they pollinate .
It &apos;s really horrible .
And blowflies just can &apos;t help themselves .
I photographed this thing last week in Dorset .
This is the philodendron selloum .
This is the most amazing thing .
That sort of phallic bit there is about a foot long .
This thing does something else which is unusual .
There &apos;s a thermoregulation mechanism in there that keeps constant temperature .
And they get inside , and they get it all on .
And what a wonderful thing it is .
So there &apos;s something that goes on off the end there .
Well yes we can .
So what is an insect seeing ?
And this is what it looks like with visible light .
Most bees don &apos;t perceive red .
And that &apos;s a real fantastic bull &apos;s eye .
So maybe the chemical in that would be useful .
And I love the idea of something hidden .
That &apos;s the main use of that filter .
Thank you very much .
Srdja Popovic : How to topple a dictator
Good afternoon . I am proud to be here at TEDxKrakow .
Here it is . It is December 15 , 2010 .
But you need to share it with the world . Okay ?
Curiosity killed the cat . You take the bet .
Next thing you know , two guys in white appear .
Well , people power has been there for a while .
It helped Gandhi kick the Brits from India .
It helped Martin Luther King win a historic racial struggle .
If this is true , we can help these movements .
Well , first one , analytic skills .
What is the average age of Egyptians ? 24 .
How long was Mubarak in power ? 31 .
It seems that Generation Epsilon is coming .
Now let me set another example .
And , I mean , there is a set of conditions .
Let me give you the example .
I am coming from a country called Serbia .
Guess what ? That was the day of his defeat .
They appear on the street only with the flag of Egypt .
I will give you a counter-example .
You see nine presidential candidates running against Lukashenko .
You will know the outcome .
That thing doesn &apos;t exist in the world .
If you maintain nonviolent discipline , you will exclusively win .
One single act of violence can literally destroy your movement .
Now let me move to another place .
It &apos;s selection of strategies and tactics .
There are certain rules in nonviolent struggle you may follow .
First , you start small .
Second , you pick the battles you can win .
It &apos;s only 200 of us in this room .
We won &apos;t call for the March of Millions .
They &apos;re very useful in a violent oppression .
So it works like in a video game .
You have a fear high , you have status quo .
You have enthusiasm higher , you see fear starting to melt .
In Egypt , you can tell that something is happening there .
Well , that &apos;s just the beginning of the show .
The real show starts when the police appears .
We are three blocks away observing it from our espresso bar .
Arrest the shoppers with kids ? Doesn &apos;t make sense .
When you start to mock them , it hurts .
Don &apos;t mix tools with the substance .
But here is also the bad news .
Are they going to become the world wave ?
This is the difference between two towns .
Now , what &#91; do &#93; the statistics have ?
This is one more reason to look at this phenomenon .
Thank you .
Gordon Brown : Wiring a web for global good
This is Tiananmen Square .
And what do all these pictures and events have in common ?
They protested across Britain .
They won public opinion over a long period of time .
But it took 24 years for the campaign to be successful .
Now look at what &apos;s happened in the last 10 years .
200 years ago the problem we had to solve was slavery .
My husband too has spent a long time in prison . &quot;
We cannot solve these problems unless we work together .
Take the financial crisis .
I have just been talking to the President of Sierra Leone .
There is a photograph of a boy called David .
Beside that photograph there is the information about his life .
It said &quot; David , age 10 . &quot;
David : ambition to be a doctor .
Favorite sport : football . What did he enjoy most ?
Making people laugh .
How did he die ?
Tortured to death .
And we never did .
So my argument today is basically this .
They said , &quot; Let &apos;s march . &quot;
We should be marching towards a global society .
Thank you .
Oliver Sacks : What hallucination reveals about our minds
And seeing with the brain is often called imagination .
They don &apos;t seem to be of our creation .
They don &apos;t seem to be under our control .
I went in to see her .
So I said , &quot; What sort of things ? &quot;
A man who turns towards me and smiles .
But he has huge teeth on one side of his mouth .
Animals too .
Then , one night , the scene changes .
I see cats and dogs walking towards me .
They come to a certain point and then stop .
Then it changes again .
I said , &quot; Is this like a dream ? &quot;
But it &apos;s completely silent , like a silent movie . &quot;
And she said that it &apos;s a rather boring movie .
And she has a sense of humor .
She knew it was a hallucination .
She had no control over them .
And she didn &apos;t know what was going on .
She wondered if she was going mad or losing her mind .
Well , I examined her carefully .
She wasn &apos;t on any medications which could produce hallucinations .
But she was blind .
And you have Charles Bonnet syndrome .
You have Charles Bonnet syndrome . &quot;
She said , &quot; Who is this Charles Bonnet ? &quot;
She said , &quot; Did he have them himself ? &quot;
Well , so I did tell the nurses .
Now this , for me , is a common situation .
I work in old-age homes , largely .
About 10 percent of the hearing impaired people get musical hallucinations .
His grandfather had these hallucinations .
His grandfather was a magistrate , an elderly man .
He &apos;d had cataract surgery .
His vision was pretty poor .
It was a large blue handkerchief with four orange circles .
And he knew it was a hallucination .
You don &apos;t have handkerchiefs in midair .
And then he saw a big wheel in midair .
And then the handsome young men disappeared .
They don &apos;t usually fade in and out .
They are rather sudden , and they change suddenly .
That was the only figure he recognized .
This repetition of perception is sometimes called palinopsia .
And you start to see things .
The things you see can be very complicated indeed .
She had very mobile hallucinations as well .
A lot of them had to do with a car .
Another patient of mine had a different sort of hallucination .
And , above all , she would see cartoons .
And especially she saw cartoons of Kermit the Frog .
You know , I was wondering about Freudian determinants .
Why Kermit ?
Kermit the Frog means nothing to me . &quot;
She didn &apos;t mind the cartoons too much .
And these frightened her .
Well , what is going on with these people ?
They seduce you . They humiliate you .
They jeer at you .
You interact with them .
You &apos;re at a particular road junction .
You smell chestnuts roasting .
You hear the traffic . All the senses are involved .
And you &apos;re waiting for your girl .
And it &apos;s that Tuesday evening back in 1982 .
The Charles Bonnet ones are quite different .
And one of the second commonest is cartoons .
So , what is going on ?
You don &apos;t form images with your primary visual cortex .
It &apos;s very interesting that that should be specific .
&quot; Face cells &quot; were discovered around 1970 .
I saw an Aston Martin this morning .
I had to bring it in .
And now it &apos;s in there somewhere .
Suddenly this , and suddenly that .
&quot; Kermit means nothing to me . &quot;
You don &apos;t get anywhere thinking of them as dreams .
Well , I &apos;ve more or less said what I wanted .
Think of the number of blind people .
Thanks very much .
That was superb . Thank you so much .
Have you yourself experienced any of the syndromes you write about ?
Oliver Sacks : I was afraid you &apos;d ask that .
Well , yeah , a lot of them .
And actually I &apos;m a little visually impaired myself .
And I see the geometrical hallucinations .
But they stop there .
And they don &apos;t disturb you ?
That was an utterly , utterly fascinating talk .
Thank you so much for sharing .
OS : Thank you . Thank you .
Bart Weetjens : How I taught rats to sniff out land mines
As a child , I had two passions .
One was a passion for rodents .
I also had a passion for Africa .
Africa was truly fascinating for me .
We &apos;re talking &apos; 95 now .
We chose rats .
Why would you choose rats ?
Because , aren &apos;t they vermin ?
And actually , our product -- what you see here .
There &apos;s a target somewhere here .
There , the animal finds a mine .
It scratches on the soil .
And the animal comes back for a food reward .
Very , very simple .
Very sustainable in this environment .
Here , the animal gets its food reward .
And that &apos;s how it works .
Very , very simple .
Now why would you use rats ?
They &apos;re extremely sensitive to smell .
Now how do we communicate with rats ?
This consists of 400 square meters .
Question of scale .
We have a demonstration site in Mozambique .
But let me bring you to a very different problem .
You can actually cure T.B. , even in HIV-positives .
So in our common language , Dutch , the name for T.B.
So how does it work ?
You have a cassette with 10 samples .
You put these 10 samples at once in the cage .
Here it &apos;s already at the third sample .
This is a positive sample .
It gets a click sound and comes for the food reward .
But let &apos;s stick first to tuberculosis .
Microscopy for 1,800 patients .
So this is really considerable .
At least our hero rats have saved lots of lives .
The way forward for us is now to standardize this technology .
So , to standardize this .
To conclude , there are also other applications at the horizon .
This is in a prototype stage .
We don &apos;t have a working system here yet .
Thank you very much .
Amy Tan : Where does creativity hide ?
The Value of Nothing : Out of Nothing Comes Something .
OK .
And I had a miniature poodle .
Everything except randomness . She did not believe in randomness .
There was a reason for everything .
You become very creative , in a survival sense .
And this , then , led to my big questions .
And they &apos;re the same ones that I have today .
And this happens constantly in the writing .
You won &apos;t discover anything .
And they all operate at the same time .
There is also a big question of ambiguity .
And I would link that to something called the cosmological constant .
A very famous Chinese saying , she said .
And then we have intentions .
What are we supposed to do ?
I got these hints everywhere .
And what I need , in effect , is a focus .
And when I have the question , it is a focus .
And it seems like it &apos;s happening all the time .
And you are noticing it more often .
But you apply this .
Why or why not ?
This leads to this question .
It seems so obvious , and yet it is not .
Sometimes I get help from the universe , it seems .
And I needed to find something historically that would match that .
You wonder , are these things random chance ?
And that goes into the story , too .
A big thing that I also think about is accidents .
What is the nature of accidents ?
60 homes were destroyed , and 40 were damaged .
Responsibility was assigned to the family .
It &apos;s the son , not the father . &quot;
And so I was there on three occasions , different seasons .
And how do I create my own life ?
So , there are never complete answers .
There she is .
Thank you very much !
Andrew Fitzgerald : Adventures in Twitter fiction
But I want to start and go back to the 1930s .
And from those single points emanated stories .
Some of them were familiar stories .
Some of them were new stories .
Think about episodes that happened live on radio .
There are thousands upon thousands of them .
Every single one of these points is its own broadcaster .
I believe this starts with an evolution of existing methods .
He was able to write and publish in relatively short order .
There was no mediator between him and the audience .
So this whole project was an experiment .
It was originally written specifically with Twitter in mind .
Now Twitter , of course , has a 140-character limit .
I think that &apos;s pretty exciting : tune-in literary fiction .
when this woman falls to her death .
These three characters brought an authentic vision from multiple perspectives .
It was also Twitter as a production mechanism .
All of these are rapid iterations on a theme .
Keep in mind , they &apos;re all Democrats .
And they engage with the real world .
They respond to it .
So during the Chicago mayoral election there was a parody account .
It was Mayor Emanuel .
I double checked the newspapers .
And then , very interestingly , it came to an end .
It ended , a true narrative conclusion .
And I think this is an interesting experiment in format .
In this particular case , he &apos;s talking about drone strikes .
Thank you .
Rachelle Garniez : &quot; La Vie en Rose &quot;
Catherine Bracy : Why good hackers make good citizens
I &apos;m going to talk about hackers .
It &apos;s about critical thinking .
It &apos;s about questioning existing ways of doing things .
And in many ways , hacking is what built America .
Betsy Ross was a hacker .
The Underground Railroad was a brilliant hack .
So keep that in mind .
All of you are potential civic hackers .
So what does civic hacking look like ?
They asked citizens to write the content .
So you &apos;ve heard of a hack-a-thon .
I authored this answer , and a few others .
They actually love it .
And the contract was a two-year contract for 9.3 million dollars .
They can actually build government .
We have 31 brigades in the U.S.
So please come hack with us .
Thank you .
Ananda Shankar Jayant : Fighting cancer with dance
I heard the word &quot; carcinoma . &quot;
Yes , breast cancer .
I thought I knew what fear was .
That day , I learned what fear was .
Is this the end of my dance ? &quot;
I needed something that would pull me out of all this .
But it wasn &apos;t easy .
Believe me , it definitely wasn &apos;t easy .
All I wanted to do was curl up and weep .
It was excruciatingly painful , but I did it .
Difficult .
But I needed something else .
The metaphor of Mahishasura Mardhini , of Durga .
Durga , the epitome of creative feminine energy , or shakti .
Durga , the fearless one .
Yes , cancer has just been one page in my life .
My story is the power of thought .
My story is the power of choice .
It &apos;s the power of focus .
My story is the power of a metaphor .
It &apos;s the power of an image .
Mine was that of Durga , Durga the fearless one .
Thomas Dolby : &quot; Love Is a Loaded Pistol &quot;
And that was largely because there weren &apos;t any .
And I can light up the Nutmeg like a beacon .
It &apos;s about Billie Holiday .
But I know where she was .
She was with me on my lifeboat .
And she was hot .
Jeremy Gilley : One day of peace
And when I was 12 , I became an actor .
I was told I was dyslexic .
In fact , I have got qualifications .
And so concern is where all of this comes from .
And then I thought , well maybe I could do something .
Maybe I could become a filmmaker .
Maybe there &apos;s a little change I can get involved in .
Because it &apos;s obviously incredibly frightening .
And that was when I had the idea .
There was no starting point for peace .
There was no day of global unity .
There was no day of intercultural cooperation .
So obviously we didn &apos;t have any money .
I was living at my mom &apos;s place .
And we started writing letters to everybody .
He was a prisoner of war .
He saw the bomb go off at Nagasaki .
It poisoned his blood . He died when I was 11 .
So he was like my hero .
And very quickly , some letters started coming back .
And we started to build this case .
And I remember the first letter .
One of the first letters was from the Dalai Lama .
And we didn &apos;t have money for the flight .
And then Dr. Oscar Arias came forward .
And we invited everybody , and no press showed up .
And that was kind of like the launch of this thing .
For me , it was really about the process .
It wasn &apos;t about the end result .
And that &apos;s the beautiful thing about the camera .
So anyway , we began the journey .
Yeah , I &apos;m not worried about it now .
76 countries in the last 12 years , I &apos;ve visited .
I &apos;ve recorded 44,000 young people .
I &apos;ve recorded about 900 hours of their thoughts .
And we were listening to everybody .
And it was an incredibly thing , working with the U.N.
and working with NGOs and building this case .
I don &apos;t know how to get involved in that process .
And thank you to all of them .
That was an incredible moment .
And suddenly , we started to institutionalize this day .
And it was 8 : 00 AM when I stood there .
It never happened .
And we have to make this day work .
It &apos;s been created ; nobody knows .
And I left New York freaked , but actually empowered .
I remember putting that film out and going to cynics .
It &apos;s just symbolism .
Children can lead their projects .
That &apos;s what I &apos;d heard .
And so I went back to the United Nations .
I decided that I &apos;d continue filming and make another movie .
And then UNAMA became involved in Afghanistan .
I won &apos;t go into that .
It &apos;d be really interesting if you came .
It would help and bring attention .
I think there &apos;s a number of pillars to success .
One is you &apos;ve got to have a great idea .
So these guys were absolutely crucial .
So he said yes , and we found ourselves in Afghanistan .
There was an interest in what was going on .
And her Afghan network was just absolutely everywhere .
And she was really crucial in getting the message in .
We had to wait now and see what happened .
We will observe this day .
We see it as a window of opportunity .
And we gave the film over .
Obviously it was shown , and it was amazing .
They were saying they would stop .
70 percent reduction in violence on this day at least .
And that completely blew my mind almost more than anything .
And I was there thinking about what was going on .
And I kept thinking about this 70 percent .
We have to go for a global truce .
That &apos;s exactly what we must do .
And you can see the education box there .
And obviously the life-saving is increased , the concepts help .
Ultimately , that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . &quot;
We &apos;ll make a new film about this process .
We &apos;ll utilize sport and football .
So , utilizing all of these ways to inspire individual action .
And ultimately , we have to try that .
We have to work together .
I was with Brahimi , Ambassador Brahimi .
He &apos;s an amazing man .
And I sat with him a few weeks ago .
He said , &quot; It &apos;s absolutely possible . &quot;
I said , &quot; What would you do ?
It &apos;s all about the individuals .
It &apos;s all about you and me .
It &apos;s all about partnerships .
It &apos;s about your constituencies ; it &apos;s about your businesses .
By working together , we can create peace one day .
Thank you TED . Thank you .
Thank you .
Thanks a lot .
Thank you very much . Thank you .
&quot; A lesbian girl . &quot;
I know you know a lot of endocrinology . &quot;
This wasn &apos;t rocket science .
And so he did .
Right ?
Does this make so-and-so straight ?
I was getting sexual orientation confused with gender identity .
And the data show it .
So what to do ?
And they fall apart .
That &apos;s how good it can be .
They look normal . They had normal heights .
in a crowd .
Well , where were these kids before ?
They were out there suffering , is where they were .
So we started a program in 2007 .
And since then , we have 160 patients .
Did they come from Afghanistan ? No .
And some came from England .
Jackie had been abused in the Midlands , in England .
It was a horror show .
They had to homeschool her .
And yet , she had just begun a male puberty .
And so here she is at 16 , on the left .
They will do it at 18 now .
And on the far right , there she is .
She went public , semifinalist in the Miss England competition .
The judges debated as to , can they do this ?
And she &apos;s become a remarkable spokeswoman .
Go figure .
So this picture , I think , says it all .
It really says it all .
He &apos;s got a prominent Adam &apos;s apple .
Now Nicole is on estrogen .
She has a bit of a form to her .
And then they finally got it .
So where do we go from here ?
We need less expensive drugs .
They cost a fortune .
And we need to get this condition out of the DSM .
And this isn &apos;t going to break anybody &apos;s budget .
This is not that common .
Thank you .
Melinda Gates : What nonprofits can learn from Coca-Cola
Coke is everywhere .
And I &apos;m not the first person to ask this question .
It &apos;s staggering , if you think about Coca-Cola .
They sell 1.5 billion servings every single day .
So why does this matter ?
So let &apos;s start with the data .
They have this very continuous feedback loop .
They have a whole team called &quot; Knowledge and Insight . &quot;
It &apos;s a lot like other consumer companies .
Let &apos;s contrast that for a minute to development .
Real-time data turns on the lights .
So what &apos;s the second thing that Coke &apos;s good at ?
They &apos;re good at tapping into that local entrepreneurial talent .
Let &apos;s look at the development side .
What is it that governments and NGOs can learn from Coke ?
Now , think about how this can change people &apos;s lives .
So what &apos;s the next step for Ethiopia ?
Well , they &apos;re already starting talk about this .
The third component of Coke &apos;s success is marketing .
Well , it &apos;s aspirational .
Coke &apos;s global campaign slogan is &quot; Open Happiness . &quot;
But they localize it .
Now , that played itself out in the World Cup campaign .
So how does health and development market ?
Well , it &apos;s based on avoidance , not aspirations .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ve heard some of these messages .
&quot; Use a condom , don &apos;t get AIDS . &quot;
&quot; Wash you hands , you might not get diarrhea . &quot;
And I think that &apos;s a mistake .
One example is sanitation .
But there &apos;s a solution : you build a toilet .
People reuse it for a slab for their home .
They sometimes store grain in it .
I &apos;ve even seen it used for a chicken coop .
Well , you work with the community .
And it works -- look at these headlines .
I &apos;m not kidding .
Women are refusing to marry men without toilets .
No loo , no &quot; I do . &quot;
But more importantly , it saves lives .
And can you guess what the young men are waiting for ?
They &apos;re waiting to be circumcised .
Can you you believe that ?
Well , why is all of this so important ?
In 2009 , we &apos;re down to 1,600 cases .
Well how did that happen ?
Let &apos;s look at a country like India .
They have two and a half million vaccinators .
Now it could have come from one of two places .
So many more people would have been affected .
So what &apos;s the endgame ?
It &apos;s not the marketing on the ground .
We have a problem with marketing in the donor community .
And we are so close .
And this victory is so possible .
To me , that is deep happiness .
Thank you .
JoAnn Kuchera-Morin : Stunning data visualization in the AlloSphere
Our scientist colleagues are finding new patterns in the information .
This first project is called the AlloBrain .
You &apos;re flying through the cortex of my colleague &apos;s brain .
They &apos;re mining blood density levels .
And they &apos;re reporting them back to you sonically .
You view the bond in the triangle .
We think it makes a beautiful structural art .
Oxygen , hydrogen and zinc have their own signature .
And you &apos;re going to hear an undulation between the sound .
This is actually a light emitter .
They &apos;re starting to find new mathematical structures in these calculations .
And they &apos;re understanding more about quantum mathematics .
This will be the final project that I show you .
You &apos;re actually seeing and hearing quantum information flow .
Thank you very much .
Ben Saunders : Why bother leaving the house ?
I &apos;m usually introduced as a polar explorer .
The pithiest answer to the question &quot; why ? &quot;
Now I &apos;m not actually sure that he did say that .
There is not the slightest prospect of any gain whatsoever .
We don &apos;t live to eat and make money .
We eat and make money to be able to enjoy life .
There was a bit of fun , a bit of joy .
And that journey lasted 10 weeks , 72 days .
Beyond that , I didn &apos;t see anyone for 10 weeks .
NASA described conditions that year as the worst since records began .
And I would add a cautionary note here , however .
Many of you will know the story .
This is a photo of Captain Scott and his team .
Is there a chance you &apos;ll see her there ? &quot;
But Scott &apos;s journey remains unfinished .
So that &apos;s precisely what I &apos;m setting out to do .
We have to turn around and come back again .
Thank you very much .
Tal Golesworthy : How I repaired my own heart
I &apos;m a process engineer .
This is an inherited disorder .
Everyone in here will be between 3.2 and 3.6 cm .
I was already up at 4.4 .
The thought of the surgery was not attractive .
The thought of the warfarin was really quite frightening .
I can do this . I can change this .
The project aim is really quite simple .
So the possibility exists to simply externally wrap the pipe .
And it would remain stable and operate quite happily .
So where do we start ?
Well this is a sagittal slice through me .
This is a model of my aorta .
You can see , it &apos;s quite a complex structure .
So it &apos;s quite a difficult structure to produce .
So this is absolutely personalized medicine at its best really .
Every patient we do has an absolutely bespoke implant .
Once you &apos;ve made it , the installation &apos;s quite easy .
Happy , away I went .
So the surgical implantation actually was the easiest part .
No breaking into your circulatory system .
So it really is great .
And even worse , it inevitably foreshortens your life .
Well the answer to that is a multidisciplinary team .
This is a list of the core team .
Jargon is a big one .
The engineers amongst you will recognize rapid prototyping and CAD .
Our disciplinary conventions were funny as well .
In the medical world they look up at plans .
So the horizontal images were all an inversion .
So one needs to be careful with disciplinary conventions .
Institutional barriers were another serious headache in the project .
I &apos;m sure it &apos;s the same in Poland .
And they made extra problems for us .
You &apos;ll have an equivalent in Poland , no doubt .
We had to get past the NICE problem .
We now have a great clinical guidance out on the Net .
Funding barriers : Another big area to be concerned with .
It must be rubbish . They binned it .
I &apos;ve coined a phrase &quot; obstructive conservatism . &quot;
They don &apos;t want to change .
They simply want to do whatever they &apos;ve done before .
And in fact , there are many surgeons in the U.K.
We &apos;ve actually got 30 patients .
I &apos;m at seven and a half years .
It really is a problem . It really is a problem .
You &apos;ve got to express support for them .
Tom Treasure , professor of cardiothoracic surgery : incredible guy .
Dead easy to give him respect .
Him giving me respect ? Slightly different .
That &apos;s all the bad news .
The good news is the benefits are stonkingly huge .
Translate that one . I bet they can &apos;t .
So Heather &apos;s going to like me .
Mark Bittman : What &apos;s wrong with what we eat
I write about food . I write about cooking .
Now , that is only a little bit hyperbolic .
And why do I say it ?
There was the bomb , and there &apos;s now .
Then hear this , please .
There &apos;s more .
And that &apos;s the direct result of eating a Western diet .
Now global warming was unforeseen .
It &apos;s not the beta-carotene , it &apos;s the carrot .
The evidence is very clear that plants promote health .
This evidence is overwhelming at this point .
Not bad .
But back to animals and junk food .
What do they have in common ?
One : we don &apos;t need either of them for health .
Two : both have been marketed heavily , creating unnatural demand .
We &apos;re not born craving Whoppers or Skittles .
Now , let &apos;s imagine a parallel .
Incredible , isn &apos;t it ?
Yet they do that .
And they do this here . It &apos;s the same deal .
But industry lobbyists would never let that happen .
And guess what ?
Now , don &apos;t get me wrong .
That &apos;s our number . 10 billion .
That &apos;s just the United States .
Seriously .
They both get it wrong , though .
A hundred years ago , guess what ?
Every family had a cook , usually a mom .
And those moms bought and prepared food .
It was like your romantic vision of Europe .
Margarine didn &apos;t exist .
There were no restaurant chains .
Eating ethnic was unheard of unless you were ethnic .
And fancy food was entirely French .
You just ate .
You didn &apos;t claim to be anything .
There was no marketing . There were no national brands .
Vitamins had not been invented .
You ate food .
The cornflake hadn &apos;t been invented .
Goldfish swam .
And again , everyone ate local .
Oranges became common in New York .
The effects of this are well known . They are everywhere .
Thus arrived convenience .
Who needed it though ? Meat was everywhere .
But by then cattle were already raised unnaturally .
New drugs kept them healthy .
Well , they kept them alive .
Healthy was another story .
And chicken soon joined them on the throne .
Meat consumption increased five-fold .
And this took care of the situation resoundingly .
Not that they were any good , but they were there .
For dessert , store-bought ice cream or cookies .
It wasn &apos;t all bad .
We weren &apos;t all hippies , either .
Meanwhile , food production had become industrial . Industrial .
Many people became fat-phobic .
Others worshiped broccoli , as if it were God-like .
But mostly they didn &apos;t eat broccoli .
Similarly , let &apos;s look at a granola bar .
Think of the frozen chicken nugget .
All you do is nuke it . What could be better ?
And zapped horribly , pathetically .
Leading the way -- what &apos;s leading the way ?
So , now we clamor for organic food .
That &apos;s good .
Let me pose you a question .
I don &apos;t know .
Now here is where we all meet .
We need to start acting .
How much livestock do you need to produce this ?
But don &apos;t we need meat to be big and strong ?
Isn &apos;t meat eating essential to health ?
Some of us might think that would be a good thing .
Ann Cooper &apos;s right .
The USDA is not our ally here .
And that happens to be quite easy .
Less meat , less junk , more plants .
It &apos;s a simple formula : eat food .
Eat real food .
We &apos;ll reduce not only calories , but our carbon footprint .
We have to choose that path .
Thank you .
David Hanson : Robots that &quot; show emotion &quot;
There he &apos;s starting to walk .
This is at the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology .
I built the head . They built the body .
It also recognizes where you &apos;re looking , your head orientation .
Okay . So I &apos;m smiling .
Now I &apos;m frowning .
And this is really heavily backlit .
Okay , here we go .
Oh , it &apos;s so sad .
Okay , so you smile , frowning .
Machines are becoming devastatingly capable of things like killing . Right ?
Those machines have no place for empathy .
And there is billions of dollars being spent on that .
So , we &apos;re involving two things .
You start to believe that it &apos;s alive and aware .
which was the basis of the movie &quot; Bladerunner . &quot;
And we &apos;re getting this mass-manufactured .
Interfacing with the Internet , it gets smarter over the years .
As artificial intelligence evolves , so does his intelligence .
Thank you so much . That &apos;s incredible .
Gever Tulley : Life lessons through tinkering
We &apos;re not trying to teach anybody any specific thing .
It &apos;s a six-day immersive experience for the kids .
Nothing ever turns out as planned ... ever .
We start from doodles and sketches .
And sometimes we make real plans .
And sometimes we just start building .
Problems become puzzles and obstacles disappear .
Decoration of the unfinished project is a kind of conceptual incubation .
All materials are available for use .
And the things that they build amaze even themselves .
Three , two , one , go !
Gever Tulley : A rollercoaster built by seven-year-olds .
Yay !
GT : Thank you . It &apos;s been a great pleasure .
Marco Tempest : Augmented reality , techno-magic
So magic is a very introverted field .
That &apos;s true even amongst peers .
Now my own speciality is combining digital technology and magic .
Could we bring down the lights please ? Thank you .
So let &apos;s give this a try .
Terribly sorry . I forgot the floor .
Wake up .
Hey .
Come on .
Please .
Come on .
Ah , sorry about that .
Forgot this .
Give it another try .
Okay .
He figured out the system .
Uh oh .
All right . Let &apos;s try this .
Come on .
Hey .
You heard her , go ahead .
Bye-bye .
Jackson Browne : A song inspired by the ocean
Thank you .
Majora Carter : Greening the ghetto
We garnered much support along the way .
One out of four South Bronx children has asthma .
These impacts are coming everyone &apos;s way .
Good .
Yeah , I &apos;m a poor black child from the ghetto .
These things make me different from you .
So how did things get so different for us ?
My dad was not alone .
A national highway construction boom was added to our problems .
600,000 people were displaced .
Now , why is this story important ?
Are these factors taken into consideration when land-use policy is decided ?
What costs are associated with these decisions ? And who pays ?
Think bike shops , juice stands .
We secured 20 million dollars to build first-phase projects .
Even during rush hour , it goes virtually unused .
Green roofs are soil and living plants .
And they provide habitats for our little friends !
So -- -- so cool !
I like that , too .
It &apos;s better to ask for forgiveness than permission .
In the post-Katrina era , we have still more in common .
We are more than simply national symbols of urban blight .
But I &apos;ll tell you later if you want to know .
At present , that &apos;s not happening in New York City .
And we are operating with a comprehensive urban planning deficit .
Now let &apos;s get this straight . I am not anti-development .
So I don &apos;t have a problem with developers making money .
This is my version of globalization .
He looked at the demographics .
For his brilliant efforts , he was nearly impeached .
We have no excuse in this country . I &apos;m sorry .
But Bogota &apos;s example has the power to change that .
You , however , are blessed with the gift of influence .
Use your influence in support of comprehensive sustainable change everywhere .
Make it a part of your dinner and cocktail conversations .
Help me fight for environmental and economic justice .
Support investments with a triple-bottom-line return .
Oh good , glad I have a little more time !
His response was a grant program .
I was making him an offer .
What troubled me was that this top-down approach is still around .
Now , don &apos;t get me wrong , we need money .
I have come from so far to meet you like this .
Ciao bellos !
Kary Mullis : A next-gen cure for killer infections
And I was pulling a molecule out of this bag .
Actually our body doesn &apos;t hate these .
Our body loves these . It eats them .
And I said , why don &apos;t you use that ?
Our antibiotics are running out .
And I feel now like George Bush .
It &apos;s like &quot; mission accomplished . &quot;
And it &apos;s killing bacteria . It &apos;s eating them .
You can stick this to something called a DNA aptamer .
Why did they not die ?
So we did it . Okay ?
Mission accomplished !
Hans Rosling : Global population growth , box by box
This box contains one billion people .
And they lived away then .
And their aspiration was to buy a car .
This was the economic level at which Sweden was .
Just look how many .
The world population has doubled since I went to school .
And now their aspiration is not only to have a car .
So this is where they are today .
They are now buying cars .
So there they are .
This is the new world we have today in 2010 .
And what will happen in the future ?
Well , I &apos;m going to project into 2050 .
They will start flying .
And they will start to buy electric cars .
This is what we will find there .
So what about the poorest two billion ?
What about the poorest two billion here ?
Will they move on ?
Here &#91; among the poorest &#93; , population is growing .
Because we already have this &#91; growth &#93; in process .
Here I have on the screen my country bubbles .
Every bubble is a country . The size is population .
The colors show the continent .
That &apos;s India and this is China . Size is population .
The year is 1960 .
Look , Bangladesh catching up with India .
They are still up here .
And the population will double in one generation .
Child survival is the new green .
And will it happen ?
I &apos;m a very serious &quot; possibilist . &quot;
It can be done .
We can have a much more just world .
And look at the position of the old West .
This will not happen &#91; again &#93; .
But it &apos;s a very important role .
Do it well and get used to it .
Thank you very much .
Joe Sabia : The technology of storytelling
Ladies and gentlemen , gather around .
I would love to share with you a story .
It was venerable .
It was ubiquitous .
But it was a little bit boring .
His name was Lothar , Lothar Meggendorfer .
He grabbed his pen , he snatched his scissors .
For this delight and for this wonder , people rejoiced .
There seemed to be no cure for this Meggendorferitis .
One Taiwanese production studio would interpret American politics in 3D .
And this was a cause for celebration .
The art of storytelling has remained unchanged .
And for the most part , the stories are recycled .
Jeff Smith : Lessons in business ... from prison
For the most part , everyone was just trying to survive .
It &apos;s a lot harder than you might think .
And it &apos;s hard for a couple of reasons .
So how do you survive ?
Well , you learn to hustle , all kinds of hustles .
There &apos;s legal hustles .
You pay everything in stamps . Those are the currency .
You charge another inmate to clean his cell .
You want a cigarette in prison ? Three to five dollars .
You want a dirty magazine ?
Well , it can be as much as 1,000 dollars .
All they &apos;ll learn on the inside is new hustles .
Thank you .
Alex Laskey : How behavioral science can lower your energy bill
How many of you have checked your email today ?
Come on , raise your hands .
How many of you are checking it right now ?
And how about finances ? Anybody check that today ?
Credit card , investment account ?
How about this week ?
Now , how about your household energy use ?
Anybody check that today ?
This week ? Last week ?
A few energy geeks spread out across the room .
It &apos;s good to see you guys .
The woman in the photo with me is Harriet .
We met her on our first family vacation .
This is the story of how Harriet came to pay attention .
In fact , only 10 percent ends up as light .
Turn off your air conditioning , turn on your fans .
Another group got an environmental message .
Most people guessed that money-saving message would work best of all .
In fact , none of these messages worked .
They had zero impact on energy consumption .
And wouldn &apos;t you know it , they did .
So what does this tell us ?
In fact , it already is .
And it &apos;s working .
And we &apos;re not burning anything .
That &apos;s half our coal usage right there .
So what are we waiting for ?
Utilities are still rewarded when their customers waste energy .
They ought to be rewarded for helping their customers save it .
But this story is much more than about household energy use .
Take a look at the Prius .
Which brings us back to Harriet .
We met her on our first family vacation .
It was then that her eyes lit up .
Now I &apos;m here with a genuine expert .
Tell me . What should I do to save energy ? &quot;
There are many experts who can help answer Harriet &apos;s question .
My goal is to make sure we are all asking it .
Thank you .
Miwa Matreyek : Glorious visions in animation and performance
Miwa Matreyek !
Ami Klin : A new way to diagnose autism
We intuit other people &apos;s feelings .
We know the meaning of their actions even before they happen .
We are social to the core .
And for them , autism was devastating .
They had profound intellectual disabilities .
Extremely , extremely isolated .
These are survival skills .
They orient to the caregiver .
Well , they orient to the caregiver .
The caregiver seeks the baby .
It doesn &apos;t . It begins with the beginning of life .
You &apos;d do probably two things , wouldn &apos;t you ?
You would recoil . You would call the police .
We do so , remember , intuitively , effortlessly .
And this is not something that happens to humans only .
Now remember that we learn a great deal by sharing experiences .
There are those individuals who don &apos;t talk at all .
There are those individuals who talk too much .
There are millions of individuals with autism all around us .
The societal cost of this condition is huge .
It &apos;s not that that window closes . It doesn &apos;t .
But it diminishes considerably .
So I feel that we have a bio-ethical imperative .
So this is our view of autism .
Autism creates itself .
So how do we do that ?
We had to see the world through her eyes .
We can see moment by moment what children are engaging with .
You &apos;re watching a video .
What are the children with autism doing ?
They are focusing on the revolving door , opening and shutting .
It &apos;s something very different .
I thought at the time that this was an intractable condition .
No longer . We can do a great deal of things .
And the idea is not to cure autism .
That &apos;s not the idea .
And there are those individuals who have incredible artistic abilities .
We want them to be free of that .
Well thank you for listening to me .
Alan Siegel : Let &apos;s simplify legal jargon !
I &apos;ve been simplifying things for 30 years .
I come out of the advertising and design business .
This is a real thing .
And many people might need help in computation .
And what about terms like &quot; over the limit &quot; ?
Perhaps a stealth thing .
Define it in context . Tell people what it means .
Plain English is about changing the content .
It &apos;s a grid , it &apos;s a calendar .
Received very favorably by business .
And there is some good news to report today .
There are 200 million letters that go out .
All the parts of the document in red are not intelligible .
They have been tested in the laboratory .
And the IRS has introduced the program .
We see all this complexity .
So , how are we going to change the world ?
Make clarity , transparency and simplicity a national priority .
I thank you .
Rodney Brooks : Why we will rely on robots
That we &apos;re overestimating the technology in the short term .
So I &apos;m scared we won &apos;t have enough robots .
And they would look that up .
The librarians were afraid their jobs were going to disappear .
But that &apos;s not what happened in fact .
Same thing happened in offices .
Back in the old days , people used spreadsheets .
But here was an interesting thing that came along .
So office workers became programmers of spreadsheets .
It increased their capabilities .
On the left there is the PackBot from iRobot .
So the robot takes over the dangerous jobs .
These are in hundreds of hospitals across the U.S.
And they take the dirty sheets down to the laundry .
They take the dirty dishes back to the kitchen .
They bring the medicines up from the pharmacy .
And ordinary people can &apos;t interact with them .
It &apos;s displaced the worker from the technology .
So Baxter is up here .
This is Chris Harbert from Rethink Robotics .
We &apos;ve got a conveyor there .
And then it &apos;ll go back , reach for another object .
The interesting thing is Baxter has some basic common sense .
By the way , what &apos;s going on with the eyes ?
The eyes are on the screen there .
The eyes look ahead where the robot &apos;s going to move .
And Baxter &apos;s safe to interact with .
But with Baxter it doesn &apos;t hurt .
It puts a little icon there .
That puts the green icon there .
He didn &apos;t have to select that from a menu .
These robots we &apos;re shipping every day .
They go to factories around the country .
This is Mildred .
Mildred &apos;s a factory worker in Connecticut .
She &apos;s worked on the line for over 20 years .
She decided she really liked robots .
Now she &apos;s got the robot doing it .
They &apos;re older , and they &apos;re getting older and older .
There aren &apos;t many young people coming into factory work .
There &apos;s two great forces that are both volitional but inevitable .
That &apos;s climate change and demographics .
Demographics is really going to change our world .
This is the percentage of adults who are working age .
And it &apos;s gone down slightly over the last 40 years .
The percentage of adults who are working age drops dramatically .
That &apos;s happening statistically right now .
And I don &apos;t mean robots in terms of companions .
Thanks very much .
Marco Tempest : A magical tale
Today &apos;s its debut .
It &apos;s a demonstration of augmented reality .
And the visuals you &apos;re about to see are not prerecorded .
They are live and reacting to me in real time .
So fingers crossed .
And keep your eyes on the big screen .
Magic is deception , but it is a deception we enjoy .
Without it , a script is just words .
Augmented reality is just the latest technology .
And sleight of hand is just an artful demonstration of dexterity .
We are all very good at suspending our disbelief .
Without this ability there is no magic .
Jean Robert-Houdin : A conjurer is not a juggler .
He is an actor playing the part of a magician .
The tricks of magic follow the archetypes of narrative fiction .
Now many of them are intensely dramatic .
Because the best stories always have a happy ending .
The tricks of magic have one special element .
They are stories with a twist .
He said that magicians deliberately exploit the way their audiences think .
MT : In that respect , magic tricks are like jokes .
Jokes lead us down a path to an expected destination .
The same thing happens when people watch magic tricks .
It &apos;s fun to be fooled .
We feel compelled to tell them .
They want to share the experience .
It keeps me busy .
We think in narrative structures .
It &apos;s a uniquely human achievement .
We turn facts into similes and metaphors , and even fantasies .
They give us our identity and a sense of community .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Hi .
I did that for two reasons .
I &apos;m used to a stationary mic .
It &apos;s the sensible shoe of public address .
I just become skanky .
So I &apos;m sorry about that .
And I &apos;m already off-message .
You cannot turn them off with a switch .
Soon , it had occurred to me what my job was .
Because that is what Knopf is .
We bring stories to the public .
They all need a face .
But you don &apos;t do this . &quot;
Because this is treating your audience like a moron .
And they deserve better .
So there you are .
Pure content and pure form , side by side .
No fighting , ladies .
Now , what is the story here ?
Someone is re-engineering dinosaurs by extracting their DNA from prehistoric amber .
Genius !
We &apos;re in the middle of the process .
And then I just threw some typography on it .
Very basic stuff , slightly suggestive of public park signage .
And even back then , Michael was on the cutting edge .
I miss Michael .
Well , they used it .
And I was thrilled .
No , that is not me .
I was so wasted . &quot;
That &apos;s a responsibility .
And it &apos;s a responsibility that I don &apos;t take lightly .
You get something that goes much deeper than that .
Hello !
What does that mean ?
Very simple stuff .
This is going to be the opposite of that .
The answer was the most low-tech thing you can imagine .
Now , that &apos;s a good printing job .
A book cover is a distillation .
This story was a real puzzle .
This is what it &apos;s about .
And so , here &apos;s the design , right ?
Huhh ! They &apos;ve been discovered by the sultan .
He will not be pleased .
Huhh ! And now the sultan is in danger .
Try experiencing that on a Kindle .
Don &apos;t get me started .
Seriously .
He &apos;d smell it .
So how do we show this ?
So this is on a semi-transparent piece of velum .
It &apos;s one part of the form and content .
And the object itself invited exploration interaction , consideration and touch .
Not exactly Jackie Collins .
So that &apos;s my story . To be continued .
What does it look like ?
Thank you .
And it is .
And yet , it feels natural to us now .
At the time , we knew that it was political .
But her suffering is equal to mine .
Aicha el-Wafi : Good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen .
I am the mother of Zacarias Moussaoui .
So they introduced me to five families .
And I saw Phyllis , and I watched her .
She was the only mother in the group .
The others were brothers , sisters .
I suffered a lot as a mother .
I was married when I was 14 .
So the story with Zacarias was too much really .
I know she really cried for her son .
But she knows where he is .
My son , I don &apos;t know where he is .
I don &apos;t know what happened to him .
We must be hand-in-hand and do something together .
I talk against violence , against terrorism .
This is why I &apos;m here in front of you .
But we were all so nervous .
&quot; Why does she want to meet us ? &quot;
And then she was nervous .
&quot; Why did we want to meet her ? &quot;
What did we want from each other ?
Because our time is up .
You must be tolerant .
You have to fight against violence .
This is what I wanted to say .
Graham Hill : Why I &apos;m a weekday vegetarian
I also knew that I &apos;m not alone .
So why was I stalling ?
Imagine your last hamburger .
Sound familiar ?
So I wondered , might there be a third solution ?
It &apos;s called weekday veg .
On the weekend , your choice .
Simple .
The program has been great , weekday veg .
Thank you .
Taryn Simon : Photographs of secret sites
Photography threatens fantasy .
And the outsider can never really reach the core .
In this context I &apos;ll just show you a few .
So I create these two poles .
Every image is accompanied with a very detailed factual text .
This is a 21-year-old Palestinian woman undergoing hymenoplasty .
This process costs 60,000 dollars .
There is a pig &apos;s head and African cane rats .
I do take certain liberties and intervene .
It &apos;s a research crop marijuana grow room .
This is a Braille edition of Playboy magazine .
And Playboy is always in the top few .
And the film was shot on 72 millimeter , government-issue film .
And that red dot is a marking on the government-issue film .
Meaning white fur , ice blue eyes , a pink nose .
It &apos;s a very violent process that is little known .
Kenny was born . He actually made it to adulthood .
This is the Death Star .
And it &apos;s shown here in its true orientation .
They flip the negative .
This is at Fort Campbell in Kentucky .
It &apos;s a Military Operations on Urbanized Terrain site .
It &apos;s called the World Church of God .
It &apos;s supposed to be a generic site of worship .
And I put them into my photograph .
It runs 24 hours a day , commercial free .
It &apos;s titled &quot; The Innocents . &quot;
I &apos;ll give you an example from a case .
And he served 10 years of a life sentence .
He served 18 years of a death sentence .
Calvin Washington was convicted of capital murder .
He is photographed at his alibi location .
I photographed him at the scene of arrest in Chicago .
William Gregory was convicted of rape and burglary .
He served seven years of a 70 year sentence in Kentucky .
He had been misidentified by an 11-year-old victim .
Now I &apos;m going to leave you with a self portrait .
That &apos;s it . Thank you .
Ed Boyden : A light switch for neurons
Think about your day for a second .
Let &apos;s make it concrete .
It &apos;s called the basket cell .
New ones are being discovered everyday .
They &apos;re excitatory .
Every one of these cells is an incredible electrical device .
Could we dial-in information precisely where we want it to go ?
Now how are we going to do that ?
So how do we do this ?
So these molecules are called channelrhodopsins .
So this turned out to be very simple to do .
You take this DNA and you put it into a neuron .
So this is very powerful .
This field has now come to be known as optogenetics .
The brain will do more of whatever got that reward .
And so that &apos;s what happens .
And he &apos;ll do that hundreds and hundreds of times .
Now we can generalize the idea .
Or that could be good clinical targets for treating brain disorders .
This goes back to the Pavlovian days .
This tone used to mean bad news .
And now this next clip is just eight minutes later .
Okay , there it goes . Right now .
If we could do that , this could be extremely powerful .
I already told you that electrical stimulators are not uncommon .
Seventy-five thousand people have Parkinson &apos;s deep-brain stimulators implanted .
And the retina , of course , is a complex structure .
Now how could you repair this ?
The eye is still transparent and you can get light in .
So this is some work that we &apos;re doing .
So he &apos;s not using vision to do it .
So how are we going to solve this ?
Light is converted to electricity on them .
Thank you .
Ed Boyden : That &apos;s right .
Right , yeah .
Ueli Gegenschatz : Extreme wingsuit flying
I started with paragliding .
Also different aerobatic maneuvers are possible with a paraglider .
From there I started with skydiving .
From regular , relative skydiving I went on to freeflying .
Freeflying is more the three-dimensional skydiving .
The one with the yellow-green suit , he &apos;s flying head-down .
From freeflying I went on to skysurfing .
Skysurfing is skydiving with a board on the feet .
From there I went on to wingsuit flying .
This is a jump I did in Rio de Janeiro .
You can see the Copacabana on the left-hand side .
of being in free fall , with all the visual references .
In 2008 I jumped the Eiffel Tower in Paris .
Or this jump , from a moving truck on the highway .
You need to have the best possible equipment .
Enjoy , and thank you very much .
I have some questions .
I think we all might have some questions .
Because it looks like it might .
It &apos;s not possible to land a wingsuit yet .
And I believe soon .
UE : Nope . It &apos;s just smoke .
Coming off of you ?
UE : Hopefully not .
That seems dangerous .
What do you do to to cover your face ?
Are you in a helmet ? Are you in goggles ?
And is that how you usually fly ?
So you have to be prepared .
Right . Now is there anything you don &apos;t do ?
UE : Thank you very much .
Amanda Palmer : The art of asking
So I didn &apos;t always make my living from music .
Hello .
And I would get harassed sometimes .
People would yell at me from their passing cars .
&quot; Get a job ! &quot;
It was consistent .
This was me on piano , a genius drummer .
This is a library in Auckland .
And I lay there thinking , these people have so little .
Is this fair ?
And I thought , this is fair .
This is this .
I &apos;ve always been with my band or my crew .
Is this what stupid people do ?
Is this how stupid people die ?
So I couchsurf a lot . I also crowdsurf a lot .
I maintain couchsurfing and crowdsurfing are basically the same thing .
And meanwhile , my band is becoming bigger and bigger .
We signed with a major label .
And our music is a cross between punk and cabaret .
It &apos;s not for everybody .
Well , maybe it &apos;s for you .
And they walk off .
I just want you to have this money . &quot;
And this starts happening all the time .
Thank you .
And the goal was 100,000 dollars .
And you can see how many people it is .
It &apos;s about 25,000 people .
How did you make all these people pay for music ? &quot;
It &apos;s kind of counterintuitive for a lot of artists .
They don &apos;t want to ask for things .
And a lot of artists have a problem with this .
Asking makes you vulnerable .
And this hurt in a really familiar way .
So this is slightly not safe for work .
This is my Kickstarter backer party in Berlin .
Should I ? Show me .
I see them as trust .
Thank you .
They &apos;ve changed the world .
And this here is the infamous NSA data center in Utah .
And it &apos;s a pretty big building .
Maybe it &apos;s better to imagine it as a comparison .
This is five times larger .
How many hard drives can you fit in an IKEA store ?
Right ? It &apos;s pretty big .
In fact , 96 percent of the planet are foreigners .
Right ?
They &apos;re about doing surveillance on people they know are innocent .
Now we know for a fact it &apos;s happening .
We didn &apos;t know about DoubleArrow .
But now we do .
So that &apos;s basically perfectly safe , uncrackable .
Backdooring encryption algorithms just boggles the mind .
But of course , these intelligence agencies are doing their job .
So what do we actually know about the leaks ?
Everything is based on the files leaked by Mr. Snowden .
And every single one of these companies denies .
Yet we have these files .
Instead , they &apos;ve been hacked .
And there &apos;s more evidence supporting this theory as well .
What the hell ?
All countries spy .
And maybe that &apos;s true .
Let &apos;s take , for example , Sweden .
And then we turn it around .
How many American leaders use Swedish webmails and cloud services ?
And the answer is zero .
So this is not balanced .
It &apos;s not balanced by any means , not even close .
Like , Skype used to be secure .
It used to be end-to-end encrypted .
Then it was sold to the United States .
Today , it no longer is secure .
It &apos;s the war on terror .
You shouldn &apos;t worry about it .
Well , it &apos;s not the war on terror .
It &apos;s not the war on terror .
Feel free to survey me if that helps .
And I have nothing to hide .
I &apos;m not doing anything bad or anything illegal .
Privacy is nonnegotiable .
It should be built in to all the systems we use .
And surveillance changes history .
We know this through examples of corrupt presidents like Nixon .
She was one of the targets of NSA surveillance .
That &apos;s what it &apos;s about .
Privacy is the building block of our democracies .
So Mr. Snowden , he &apos;s been blamed for many things .
So , what is there to be done ?
Should we worry . No , we shouldn &apos;t worry .
But that &apos;s not going to really change the situation .
And that &apos;s much easier said than done .
How do you do that ?
But maybe you don &apos;t have to do it alone .
Maybe you can do it together with other countries .
The solution is open source .
It only has to solve one little problem .
Thank you very much .
Charlie Todd : The shared experience of absurdity
Now this took place in January of 2002 .
And this woman is the star of the video .
She doesn &apos;t know she &apos;s being filmed .
She &apos;s being filmed with a hidden camera .
This is on the 6 train in New York City .
And this is the first stop along the line .
And that &apos;s me right there in a brown coat .
It &apos;s about 30 degrees outside .
I &apos;m wearing a hat . I &apos;m wearing a scarf .
And the girl &apos;s going to notice me right here .
One person &apos;s not that unusual .
They &apos;re going to be entering this car one by one .
We &apos;ll act as though we don &apos;t know each other .
And watch her make eye contact with them right about now .
So the video won &apos;t show everything .
This goes on for another four stops .
A total of seven guys enter anonymously in their underwear .
Thank you .
So that &apos;s a still from the video there .
And I love that girl &apos;s reaction so much .
And we &apos;ve continued to do it every year .
So I could do more large-scale projects .
So I got inspired by that .
This was completely unauthorized .
We didn &apos;t let the stores know we were coming .
And I stood in the park giving signals .
The second signal was for everybody to do Jumping jacks together .
You &apos;ll see that start right here .
And then we had dancing . We had everyone dance .
There were several other activities .
There &apos;s a better photo of it .
So here &apos;s the video .
So again , this is 2005 .
This is the Best Buy in New York City .
There was an eight year-old girl , a 10 year-old girl .
There was also a 65 year-old man who participated .
So a very diverse group of people .
But also , don &apos;t shop .
Just stand around and don &apos;t face products . &quot;
Everybody else is one of our actors .
The lower level employees thought it was very funny .
You can see them in this footage .
They &apos;re wearing either a yellow shirt or a black shirt .
And you can see the cops in this footage right here .
Thank you .
And one morning , I was riding the subway .
It &apos;s morning rush hour .
It &apos;s very cold outside .
Thank you .
And of course they don &apos;t .
You know , as kids , we &apos;re taught to play .
And we &apos;re never given a reason why we should play .
It &apos;s just acceptable that play is a good thing .
We don &apos;t need a reason .
Thank you very much .
Edi Rama : Take back your city with paint
In my previous life , I was an artist .
I still paint . I love art .
We faced many challenges .
But this use of colors was not just an artistic act .
He screeched that he would block the financing .
&quot; But why ? &quot; I asked him .
So it &apos;s time for change .
What are colors doing to us ? &quot;
Thirty-seven said no , we don &apos;t like it .
So we noticed change .
They had thrown the old shutter in the garbage collection place .
&quot; Come on , man ! What policemen ?
And this was not a misplaced feeling .
Crime did fall .
We removed 123,000 tons of concrete only from the riverbanks .
We planted 55,000 trees and bushes in the streets .
It &apos;s not about genes .
It &apos;s about system , it &apos;s about organization .
It &apos;s also about environment and respect .
We removed the kiosks .
We put the citizen first , and not the clerks .
I tweet . I love it .
Politics is not just about leaders .
It &apos;s not just about politicians and laws .
Our world is defined by the pace of change .
We can all change the world .
Efharisto and kalinihta .
Dan Meyer : Math class needs a makeover
I teach high school math .
I mean , it &apos;s just a losing proposition .
One is computation ; this is the stuff you &apos;ve forgotten .
For example , factoring quadratics with leading coefficients greater than one .
all but ensures they won &apos;t retain it .
Students lack perseverance .
This is really destructive .
He called it , &quot; an impatience with irresolution . &quot;
You &apos;re impatient with things that don &apos;t resolve quickly .
It applies equally to math .
I believe in real life .
Here &apos;s a really cool problem . I like this .
It &apos;s about defining steepness and slope using a ski lift .
I &apos;ll define them here : You have the visual .
So I hope you can see .
That &apos;s all we &apos;re doing here .
It &apos;s been obvious in my practice , to me .
And here &apos;s how it works .
I like this question . It &apos;s about a water tank .
First things first , we eliminate all the substeps .
Students have to develop those , they have to formulate those .
None of it &apos;s a distractor , so we lose that .
Such an underrepresented question in math curriculum .
So now we have a water tank .
So now we have the real deal .
How long will it take it to fill it up ?
And it &apos;s filling up slowly , agonizingly slowly .
It &apos;s tedious .
And then we follow the process I &apos;ve described .
We , instead , just watch the end of the movie .
This has been a lot of fun .
Math makes sense of the world .
Math is the vocabulary for your own intuition .
We need more patient problem solvers . Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Mariana Mazzucato : Government -- investor , risk-taker , innovator
Usually when I say this , someone says , &quot; Spotify !
That &apos;s Europe . &quot; But , yeah .
They are more dynamic .
This monster with big tentacles .
They &apos;re very explicit in these editorials .
Fund the infrastructure . Fund the schools .
Leave the rest to the revolutionaries . &quot;
Those colorful , out-of-the-box kind of thinkers .
GPS was funded by the military &apos;s Navstar program .
Even Siri was actually funded by DARPA .
They do . They spend on the marketing part .
They spend on the D part of R &amp; amp ; D.
It was actually shaping and creating markets .
It was even , God forbid , being a venture capitalist .
They want their returns in three to five years .
Who &apos;s actually funding the hard stuff ?
Of course , it &apos;s not just the state .
The private sector does a lot .
And so there &apos;s huge implications of this .
It &apos;s actually been the one thinking out of the box .
That whole juxtaposition thing , it &apos;s kind of there .
Well , there &apos;s a self-fulfilling prophecy .
You will fail when you innovative .
One out of 10 experiments has any success .
The Internet was crazy .
Well , unfortunately , that &apos;s not true .
Let the jobs go where they have to go , perhaps .
I mean , one can take a position on that .
It could happen perhaps through equity .
Thank you .
Jennifer 8 . Lee : The hunt for General Tso
What is this ?
Should I try it ?
Try it !
What is it called ?
Fortune cookie .
There &apos;s a piece of paper inside !
What is this ?
You &apos;ve won a prize !
What is this ?
It &apos;s a fortune !
Tasty !
So , where are they from ?
The short answer is , actually , they &apos;re from Japan .
So , how did they get to the United States ?
They are more American than anything else .
I love this dish .
He &apos;s in Taiwan right now .
He &apos;s retired , deaf and plays a lot of Mahjong .
I went to his home town .
And I went looking for chicken .
Finally found a cow -- and did find chicken .
And then they &apos;re like , is this Chinese food ?
Because it doesn &apos;t look like Chinese food to them .
Now , who came up with the idea of chop suey ?
So it was an early exercise of intellectual property rights .
So , you see different varieties of Chinese food .
She &apos;s like , &quot; It &apos;s not ?
And even the Brits have their own version .
This is a dish called Magic Bowl that I discovered .
But you know what ?
Instead , they had 110 , and they were completely shocked .
It wasn &apos;t that .
Yeah . So , I went and started looking .
So , a good sort of contrast is Chicken McNuggets .
And this logo !
So . Thank you very much .
Dong Woo Jang : The art of bow-making
Why bows ?
I &apos;m not quite sure .
And I did not bring the tools here to Long Beach .
Airport security .
I also researched extensively on bows around the world .
The most effective bow for me would be like this .
And four : Horn used to store energy in compression .
Thanks to my ancestors for robbing me of my invention .
And let &apos;s see how this one works .
This is a bamboo bow , with 45-pound draw weights .
You need to console and communicate with the wood material .
The bow resembles me , and I resemble the bow .
Now , I am shooting a part of myself to you .
Did it strike you ?
Thank you .
Erin McKean : The joy of lexicography
How about this word ?
Here , I &apos;ll show it to you .
Lexicography : the practice of compiling dictionaries .
It &apos;s little discrete -- that &apos;s spelled D-I-S-C-R-E-T-E -- bits .
And those bits are words .
Right ? Nobody hugs their dictionaries .
For one thing , I just do not do uniforms .
Well , I blame the Queen .
Why do I blame the Queen ?
So , there &apos;s this guy , right ? Victorian era .
James Murray , first editor of the Oxford English Dictionary .
There &apos;d be virtually no learning curve .
Computers ! What about computers ?
The thing about computers is , I love computers .
They don &apos;t change the end result .
It &apos;s steampunk . What we have is an electric velocipede .
The design has not changed .
And OK , what about online dictionaries , right ?
Online dictionaries must be different .
This is my favorite word , by the way .
Very useful word . So , look at that .
Online dictionaries right now are paper thrown up on a screen .
So there &apos;s not very much going on here .
There &apos;s not a lot of clickiness .
Does everyone know the ham butt problem ?
Woman &apos;s making a ham for a big , family dinner .
We have a pan that &apos;s too small !
So , you can &apos;t get a smaller ham .
The English language is as big as it is .
Some of my best friends are books .
But the book is not the best shape for the dictionary .
Now they &apos;re going to think &quot; Oh , boy .
No . There will still be paper dictionaries .
And I think this is a problem .
Lexicography is really more about material science .
They &apos;re just the right tools for the job .
Being in the dictionary is an artificial distinction .
If you love a word , it becomes real .
You can ask for help !
That &apos;s 500,000 more words . So that &apos;s a lot .
There &apos;s a lot going on there .
The OED has 33 different numbered definitions for set .
Tiny , little word , 33 numbered definitions .
One of them is just labeled &quot; miscellaneous technical senses . &quot;
Do you know what that says to me ?
I mean , lexicography is not rocket science .
And we don &apos;t even know the shape of the language .
We &apos;re missing California from American English .
So again , lexicography is not rocket science .
It can &apos;t be that hard to find some words !
He &apos;s a director of an electroplating company .
He &apos;s found more than 140 comets .
But he found 140 comets without a telescope .
Now , y &apos;all know where I &apos;m going with this .
Where did it come from ? Who said it ?
What newspaper was it in ? What book ?
Because a word is like an archaeological artifact .
So a word without its source is like a cut flower .
It dies too fast .
They use it synecdochically .
We can put in all the meanings .
Doesn &apos;t everyone want more meaning in their lives ?
This is what dictionaries used to look like .
It wasn &apos;t really what people needed .
Thank you very much for your kind attention .
Angela Belcher : Using nature to grow batteries
I brought along with me an abalone shell .
Yet , it &apos;s 3,000 times tougher than its geological counterpart .
So that &apos;s the vision that I &apos;ve been thinking about .
I like to say my favorite biomaterial is my four year-old .
Before that , they were all soft , fluffy structures .
So nature already gives us really exquisite structures on the nanoscale .
So here are some examples : these are some natural shells .
There are natural biological materials .
These proteins are very negatively charged .
And so here &apos;s the periodic table .
And I absolutely love the periodic table .
And so I give this out to thousands of people .
And that &apos;s a hard sell to a graduate student .
&quot; I have this great project -- 50 million years . &quot;
And this is pretty easy biotechnology .
And you could basically do this a billion times .
We engineered a virus to pick up carbon nanotubes .
So one part of the virus grabs a carbon nanotube .
And then it wires itself to the current collector .
I brought it here .
You can make lots of amplifications to it .
We &apos;re able to do this also with catalysis .
This is the example of photocatalytic splitting of water .
And I brought an example with me of that today .
My students promised me it would work .
These are virus-assembled nanowires .
In this case , you &apos;re seeing oxygen bubbles come out .
The last example are solar cells .
You can also do this with solar cells .
So this is a virus-based solar cell .
Thank you .
Stefan Sagmeister : Happiness by design
And at the time I was very superstitious .
But I actually walked away with a great job offer .
So there are , of course , two different possibilities .
This is 1983 .
And I remember it as a true moment of happiness .
While , somewhat , the Spaniards ...
And their inaugural exhibit was called &quot; Happiness . &quot;
And they interestingly sectioned the exhibit off into four different areas .
Under &quot; Nirvana &quot; they showed this Constable painting .
And there was a little -- an interesting theory about abstraction .
This is , you know , a book .
It &apos;s a happy David Byrne and an angry David Byrne .
You know , that &apos;s not a big deal to accomplish .
This is , you know , the movie poster .
True printed his own version of these signs .
So this is one .
Now , True is a real humanitarian .
Another New York project .
Opens up at dusk and dawn every day .
You don &apos;t see the horizon .
And the room is truly something to be seen .
People &apos;s demeanor changes when they go in there .
He &apos;s from Korea originally .
And other people go and fill them in .
You know , one is : just working without pressure .
Then : working concentrated , without being frazzled .
And being able to enjoy the end results .
And the whole thing just fell together .
Again , we could supply the content for it .
So I just picked another one .
And this was two weeks ago .
And then we did one more of these .
This is , again , for a magazine , dividing pages .
This is from the front .
Then it &apos;s : &quot; always works out . &quot;
Then it &apos;s &quot; for , &quot; with the light on .
And it &apos;s &quot; me . &quot;
Thank you so much .
Stephen Hawking &apos;s zero g flight
And I want to tell you that story .
I first met him through the Archon X PRIZE for Genomics .
Craig Venter chairs that event .
Come back down , you weigh twice as much .
You do it again and again .
We set out to do this .
It took us 11 years to become operational .
And we announced that we were going to fly Stephen Hawking .
And he wanted to go .
We worked hard to get all the permissions .
And what he said , for me , was very moving .
I therefore want to encourage public interest in space . &quot;
A few TEDsters here .
We set up a whole ER .
So we did a second parabola .
And a third .
And a seventh and an eighth .
And this man does not look like a 65-year-old wheelchair-bound man .
He was so happy .
Please join us in this epic adventure .
Thank you so much .
Matt Killingsworth : Want to be happier ? Stay in the moment
It &apos;s that we expect them to bring us happiness .
Maybe he &apos;s worried that he &apos;s going bald .
Any of those yes responses are what we called mind-wandering .
So what did we find ?
It &apos;s amazing .
Well , how often do people &apos;s minds wander ?
How does that depend on what people are doing ?
It pervades basically everything that we do .
Thank you .
Eli Beer : The fastest ambulance ? A motorcycle
This is an ambucycle .
This is the fastest way to reach any medical emergency .
It has everything an ambulance has except for a bed .
You see the defibrillator . You see the equipment .
We all saw the tragedy that happened in Boston .
I grew up in a small neighborhood in Jerusalem .
We were passing by a bus stop .
We saw a bus blow up in front of our eyes .
He just needed someone helping him .
We were so scared and we just ran away .
For two years , I volunteered on an ambulance in Jerusalem .
The traffic is so bad . The distance , and everything .
We never got there when somebody really needed us .
That second he declared this child dead .
He could have run from a block away .
He could have saved this child .
I said to myself , there must be a better way .
Just alert us by beeper .
We &apos;re not really interested in these kinds of new adventures .
&quot; I don &apos;t need your help , &quot; he said .
I was a very stubborn kid .
I ran there by foot . I had no medical equipment .
He was on Coumadin .
He was bleeding from his neck .
So today , 22 years later , we have United Hatzalah .
I forgot I &apos;m not in Israel .
We &apos;re not there to replace ambulances .
And we save people that otherwise would not be saved .
The second reason is because of our technology .
You know , Israelis are good in technology .
And the third thing are these ambucycles .
These ambucycles are an ambulance on two wheels .
They never , literally , get stuck in traffic .
That &apos;s why we get there so fast .
Muhammad Asli and Murad Alyan .
We started hand in hand saving Jews and Arabs .
Arabs were saving Jews . Jews were saving Arabs .
Something special happened .
Settlers were saving Arabs and Arabs were saving settlers .
And these are all volunteers .
No one is getting money .
They &apos;re all doing it for the purpose of saving lives .
And he saved my father .
Could you imagine how I felt in that moment ?
When I started this organization , I was 17 years old .
I never even knew what TEDMED was then .
But it could spread everywhere .
It &apos;s very easy to adopt .
Last year alone , we treated in Israel 207,000 people .
Forty-two thousand of them were life-threatening situations .
And we made a difference .
We all want to be heroes .
Thank you very much .
Joshua Silver : Adjustable liquid-filled eyeglasses
I &apos;d like to start with a little experiment .
They also have an estimate of around a billion .
Glasses are not very expensive . They &apos;re quite plentiful .
There are just way too few eye care professionals .
This is the ratio of optometrists to people in sub-Saharan Africa .
Next step in my process .
So , I &apos;ve now made eye glasses to my prescription .
Okay , so I &apos;ve made these glasses and ...
Okay , I &apos;ve made the glasses to my prescription and ...
... I &apos;ve just ...
And I &apos;ve now made some glasses . That &apos;s it .
Now , these aren &apos;t the only pair in the world .
In fact , this technology &apos;s been evolving .
There are about 30,000 in use now .
I have a global vision for vision .
But the cost has to be brought right down .
How do you solve this problem ?
You start to get into detail .
How do you deal with the industry ?
And the answer to that is research .
Julia Bacha : Pay attention to nonviolence
I &apos;m a filmmaker .
Why aren &apos;t Palestinians using nonviolent resistance ?
Yet , most of you have probably never heard about them .
Palestinian We were told the wall would separate Palestine from Israel .
Today you &apos;re invited to a peaceful march .
You are joined by dozens of your Israeli brothers and sisters .
Israeli Activist : Nothing scares the army more than nonviolent opposition .
But I think the girls could do it .
Chanting : One united nation .
Fatah , Hamas and the Popular Front !
News Anchor : The clashes over the fence continue .
Reporter : Israeli border police were sent to disperse the crowd .
They were allowed to use any force necessary .
These are live bullets .
It &apos;s like Fallujah . Shooting everywhere .
But there were others around me who weren &apos;t even cowering .
Protester : This is a peaceful march .
There is no need to use violence .
Chanting : We can do it ! We can do it !
We can do it !
Yet the media remains mostly silent on these stories .
But that &apos;s true for adults too .
So we organized a screening .
So they kept on going .
These leaders have proven that nonviolence works in places like Budrus .
Thank you .
Seth Godin : How to get your ideas to spread
Like the greatest invention since ... the telegraph or something .
I call it the &quot; TV-industrial complex . &quot;
You use the distribution you get to sell more products .
You take the profit from that to buy more ads .
Right . Articles about water , ads about water .
Now there are magazines about water .
New products from Coke Japan -- water salad .
Cows are invisible . Cows are boring .
I could do that again if you want it .
And that is the essence of where idea diffusion is going .
Every week the number one best-selling DVD in America changes .
Because it &apos;s new , because it &apos;s fresh .
And when Lionel started his bakery the French pooh-pooh-ed it .
It wasn &apos;t what they expected .
That &apos;s what mass marketing is .
It was all about going for the center .
But market to these people because they care .
These are the people who are obsessed with something .
It &apos;ll spread to the entire curve .
Krispy Kreme has figured this whole thing out .
Not everybody wants it but they don &apos;t care .
These guys make the loudest car stereo in the world .
Pearl Jam , 96 albums released in the last two years .
Every one made a profit . How ?
They only sell them on their website .
This hospital crib cost 10,000 dollars , 10 times the standard .
But hospitals are buying it faster than any other model .
And one person at a time , the idea spreads .
These are not diamonds , not really .
They &apos;re made from &quot; cremains . &quot;
Oh , you like my ring ? It &apos;s my grandmother .
Fastest-growing business in the whole mortuary industry .
A couple of quick rules to wrap up .
Proctor and Gamble knows this , right ?
Very good is boring . Very good is average .
So my three stories .
Sales tripled . Why ?
Because he did something that was at the fringes .
People with 20,000-dollar stereos don &apos;t like new music .
The last example I want to give you .
This is a map of Soap Lake , Washington .
But they do have a lake .
That &apos;s a purple cow ; that &apos;s something worth noticing .
Thank you very much for your attention .
Rob Hopkins : Transition to a world without oil
Other stories are that everything is on the verge of unraveling .
But I want to tell you a different story here today .
Like all stories , it has a beginning .
If you could help me with that it would be fantastic .
This is a liter of oil .
It gives us an energy return that &apos;s unimaginable , historically .
And that gap continues to widen .
Completely unprecedented , historically .
Already that &apos;s fallen to about 11 .
There are 98 oil-producing nations in the world .
But of those , 65 have already passed their peak .
We have no choice other than deep and urgent decarbonization .
Otherwise you &apos;d flood your entire town with warm porridge .
It &apos;s something that was unimaginable to people then .
And we have the elves in the form of China .
This is a popular story in some places .
But the world isn &apos;t Second Life .
We can be astonishingly inventive and creative .
Energy and technology are not the same thing .
What I &apos;m involved with is the transition response .
It &apos;s something which has spread incredibly fast .
And it is something which has several characteristics .
It &apos;s sensitive to place and to scale .
Transitional is completely different .
It learns very much from its mistakes .
And it &apos;s a process which is really joyful .
The idea of resilience comes from the study of ecology .
So how does this transition idea work ?
They pick up some of the tools that we &apos;ve developed .
They show films , they give talks , and so on .
It &apos;s a process which is playful and creative and informative .
There are now over 200 formal transition projects .
They are mulling whether they &apos;re going to take it further .
We need international legislation from Copenhagen and so on .
We need national responses . We need local government responses .
A lot of places are working with their local schools .
Planting productive trees throughout urban spaces .
You take it anywhere else , it &apos;s not worth anything .
And that &apos;s certainly been my experience with transition .
And we see it all over the place as well now .
Because I think stories are vital here .
I &apos;ve been astonishingly lucky , we &apos;ve been astonishingly lucky .
Thank you very much .
&quot; People do stupid things .
That &apos;s what spreads HIV . &quot;
Well , one or two brave souls .
Wonderful .
It &apos;s getting blunter and blunter .
&quot; Oh yeah , by sharing needles . &quot;
&quot; Oh yeah . &quot; Hundred percent .
&quot; So are you carrying a needle ? &quot;
&quot; Are you carrying clean needles ? &quot;
One in four , maximum .
There &apos;s just kind of an ick factor there .
And that changes the equation slightly , doesn &apos;t it ?
So , suddenly it becomes perfectly rational to share needles .
This is a really easy problem .
For once , your incentives are aligned .
We &apos;ve got what &apos;s rational for public health .
So she was making a politically rational decision .
There is nothing on the other side .
So , completely irrational , you would think .
So it becomes quite rational to deny services to injectors .
Now let &apos;s talk about sex .
Are we any more rational about sex ?
It &apos;s not that easy !
Here , maybe you &apos;ll have better luck .
And that is reflected in the epidemic that we have today .
You can see these horrifying figures from Africa .
No one wants it .
This , for example , this gentleman is called Joseph .
He &apos;s from Haiti and he has AIDS .
Not for nothing do we call it the Lazarus Effect .
Let &apos;s just stop treating people . &quot;
Of course not , of course not .
We need to expand antiretroviral treatment as much as we can .
So these are data from Scotland .
Then it came way down .
This is of new infections .
What does that mean ?
What does it mean ?
Is that what &apos;s happening ?
No , and I call it the &quot; compassion conundrum . &quot;
Why does she do that job ?
It varies a bit province to province .
Okay , Ines .
Ines : So why is prevalence still rising ?
It &apos;s all politics .
When you get to politics , nothing makes sense .
The truth is that everyone has a different rationale .
But here &apos;s the thing : we are the voters .
Thank you .
Ellen Dunham-Jones : Retrofitting suburbia
So why is this important ?
Public health is another reason to consider retrofitting .
And then there &apos;s finally -- there &apos;s the affordability question .
I mean , that &apos;s 2005 figures .
But is it practical ?
I think it is .
They &apos;re the other big generation .
It no longer just makes sense .
That land is more valuable than just surface parking lots .
It turns out , all sorts of things .
It &apos;s keeping the lights on .
It &apos;s becoming , I think , a really great institution .
But some of them have been much more incremental .
So , you know , sometimes it &apos;s incremental .
Sometimes , it &apos;s all at once .
Transit is a big driver of retrofits .
So here &apos;s what it looks like .
This one is one of my favorites , Belmar .
This was a very large mall on a hundred-acre superblock .
Here was the mall in its heyday .
So here &apos;s the site in 1975 with the mall .
By 1995 , the mall has died .
The department stores are multistory ; they &apos;re better built .
They &apos;re easy to be re-adapted .
But the one story stuff ...
that &apos;s really history .
So here it is at projected build-out .
It &apos;s about two-thirds built out right now .
Here &apos;s what the new Main Street looks like .
You want to also try to get more systemic transformation .
We need to also retrofit the corridors themselves .
So this is one that has been retrofitted in California .
But densification is not going to work everywhere .
Sometimes re-greening is really the better answer .
This is another re-greening example .
It also makes sense in very strong markets .
The creek had been culverted under the parking lot .
What &apos;s next ?
I think we have three challenges for the future .
Where should we be redeveloping ?
And where should we be encouraging re-inhabitation ?
I have to say , these are very hybrid places .
They are new but trying to look old .
They have urban streetscapes , but suburban parking ratios .
But we &apos;ve got to get the architecture better .
The final challenge is for all of you .
Thank you .
Mitchell Besser : Mothers helping mothers fight HIV
I want you to take a trip with me .
and people are initially reluctant to tell you .
HIV isn &apos;t like other medical conditions ; it &apos;s stigmatizing .
This map depicts the global distribution of HIV .
We talk about things in relative terms .
The reality is really , very different .
It &apos;s an entire package of services , and it works .
What does that mean ?
And where do they come from ?
Well , less than one comes from the United States .
One , on average , comes from Europe .
100 come from Asia and the Pacific .
And let &apos;s look at another map .
That thin sliver you see here , that &apos;s Africa .
And it &apos;s the same with nurses .
It &apos;s not possible -- it doesn &apos;t work .
And so we need to find better ways of providing care .
Meds don &apos;t equal medical care .
And I want to change the story a little bit .
They &apos;re drinking tea , they &apos;re having sandwiches .
Have a seat . You &apos;re safe here .
We &apos;re all HIV-positive .
Your baby is going to be HIV-negative . &quot;
We view mothers as a community &apos;s single greatest resource .
So often the men are gone .
This is the medical care that goes beyond just medicines .
Now , doctors and nurses -- they too get trained .
Our mentor mothers get trained every single year and retrained .
Our organization has three goals .
The first , to prevent mother-to-child transmission .
So how do we do it ?
Men are not frequently part of pregnancy care .
And this is so important in breaking through the stigma .
Disclosure is so central to prevention .
We also work in groups .
The hardest barrier really is around stigma reduction .
And it &apos;s important about disclosure .
And so the mentor mother went along with .
And everybody was quiet .
I &apos;m HIV-positive .
I &apos;ve been afraid to tell everybody . &quot;
And you see where this is going .
I thought you were going to hate me . &quot;
I am proof that there is hope .
And it is a crisis in health care systems .
So we talk in terms of what we call task-shifting .
How do you build a better health care system ?
And our organization helps women across that bridge .
Our organization works on three levels .
The second , communities -- empowering women .
They become leaders within their communities .
We need to change attitudes to women in Africa .
We have to do that .
Our health care systems are broken .
What &apos;s extraordinary is how simple the premise is .
Mothers with HIV caring for mothers with HIV .
Past patients taking care of present patients .
And empowerment through employment -- reducing stigma .
Each person must know their HIV status .
Those who are HIV-negative must know how to stay negative .
MB : Simple solutions to complex problems .
Mothers caring for mothers .
It &apos;s transformational .
Thank you .
Jenna McCarthy : What you don &apos;t know about marriage
and not to have sex with anyone else , ever .
He buys a ring , she buys a dress .
They go shopping for all sorts of things .
She takes him to Arthur Murray for ballroom dancing lessons .
And the big day comes .
You know , because they can &apos;t hear the snoring anymore .
Of course , the other half won &apos;t , right ?
And researchers want to know why .
So what &apos;s going on when it doesn &apos;t ?
What are they doing right ?
What can we learn from them ?
Obvious , right .
For example , the happy wife .
These are couples who can find good in any situation .
Because we needed a study to tell us this .
But here &apos;s what &apos;s going on here .
Here &apos;s an interesting one .
This is an actual study , and let me clarify .
Oh no .
So what else can you do to safeguard your marriage ?
Do not win an Oscar for best actress .
I &apos;m serious .
They actually call it the Oscar curse .
Drinking alcohol , it seems , is bad for your marriage .
Yeah .
But here &apos;s a scary one : Divorce is contagious .
We &apos;re healthier , physically and emotionally .
We produce happier , more stable and more successful kids .
So I &apos;m obviously going to need fatten him up .
So we have to keep an eye on that .
And we do like a cocktail or two .
So I &apos;ve got all those things going for me .
I &apos;ll see you at the bar .
John Maeda : How art , technology and design inform creative leaders
Do you know about the parent-teacher conference ?
And he kind of nodded , you know ?
And that always stuck with me all my life .
As you remember , the Apple II did nothing at all .
It would say you &apos;re wrong most of the time .
That was the computer we knew .
It was called the Human Powered Computer Experiment .
It &apos;s a room broken in two halves .
And the floppy disk drive person wears it .
So starting from technology , technology is a wonderful thing .
And then after a few years , we got CD-quality sound .
And then movies , via CD-ROM . It was amazing .
Remember that excitement ?
You see this little pattern here ?
Well , content is the word up there : fear .
Or fear like this , kind of a nightclub typeface .
Like , we gotta go to Fear .
It &apos;s , like , amazing , right ?
It just changes the same content .
You feel for them .
Or you change the typeface to something like this .
I can never get in there .
Free bold feels like Mandela free .
It &apos;s like , yes , I can be free .
Design does that .
So -- yeah .
So I made a lot of work in the &apos; 90s .
This was a square that responds to sound .
It &apos;s called &quot; Tap , Type , Write . &quot;
It has 10 variations .
There &apos;s a shift .
This is , like , a ring of letters .
It &apos;s peaceful , like that .
Thank you .
Thank you .
And why do we have this facility ?
And the shopkeeper would say , &quot; It &apos;s old . &quot;
And he realized , it isn &apos;t about old or new .
It &apos;s about something in between .
We aren &apos;t functioning so easily anymore .
We aren &apos;t a simple authoritarian regime anymore .
And also &quot; no love . &quot;
So that is authoritarianism .
And what is that , structurally ?
It is now a network instead of a perfect tree .
Someone who &apos;s creative actually loves to learn from mistakes .
And it felt kind of like being president , actually .
How many coffees do you have ?
How often are you calling them , emailing them ?
So these kind of systems , I believe , are important .
They &apos;re targeted social media systems around leaders .
Emiliano Salinas : A civil response to violence
I was born in 1976 .
I grew up in a traditional Mexican family .
Don &apos;t worry .
I think we have a problem in Mexico .
We have a big problem .
I think there &apos;s consensus on this .
No one argues -- we all agree there &apos;s a problem .
Is it the Zetas ? The drug traffickers ? The government ?
Corruption ? Poverty ? Or is it something else ?
I think none of these is the problem .
I don &apos;t mean they don &apos;t deserve attention .
We are a country of victims .
We were victims of the Spaniards .
Then we were victims of the French .
Then we were victims of Don Porfirio .
Then we were victims of the PRI .
Even of Salinas .
And of El Peje .
Hold on ! Wait a minute !
What if none of these things is the problem ?
The problem is not the things we feel victims of .
The problem is that we play the role of victims .
We want to pretend that Mexico has the flu .
But it doesn &apos;t .
Mexico has cancer .
Many people in Mexico are afraid today .
We &apos;re very afraid .
And we &apos;re acting out of that fear .
Does that make streets more or less safe ?
Less safe !
We need to confront this fear .
For many people , acting involves courage .
We go from fear to courage .
They say , &quot; I can &apos;t take it anymore .
Let &apos;s do something about it . &quot;
Usually it &apos;s one or two a year .
Now we &apos;re experiencing one every week .
It means it &apos;s determined and effective , but not violent .
There are examples of this kind of action in Mexico .
So what did they do ?
We &apos;ll be waiting for you right here . &quot;
They stayed there .
Of course , criminals can respond .
And in this case , they did .
On July 7th , 2009 , Benjamín Le Barón was murdered .
But he keeps fighting .
He keeps organizing .
He keeps mobilizing .
These heroic acts are present all over the country .
And they &apos;re out there !
They just have to raise their hands .
That devotion we feel for the national football team .
A mother is the most sacred thing in life .
We are going through the darkest moment in our recent history .
What are we going to do ?
Masiosare , the strange enemy , is here .
Where is the soldier in each son ?
Today in Mexico we &apos;re asking for Gandhis .
We need Ghandis .
We &apos;re facing a very powerful opponent .
But we are many more .
They can take a man &apos;s life .
Anyone can kill me , or you , or you .
But no one can kill the spirit of true Mexicans .
Thank you .
Evelyn Glennie : How to truly listen
That &apos;s my only real aim in life .
So technically , I can actually read this .
I will do exactly as I &apos;m told .
There &apos;s nothing too difficult about the piece .
I &apos;m being told where to play on the drum .
I &apos;m being told which part of the stick to use .
And I &apos;m being told the dynamic .
Snares on , snares off .
Now my career may last a little longer !
Just the basic feeling .
However , that is simply not enough .
And I think what Herbie said -- please listen , listen .
We have to listen to ourselves , first of all .
By holding it tightly , I feel strangely more detached .
And I &apos;m doing far , far less .
Not just translate them , but interpret them .
that of a difference . Then gradually ... and gradually ...
They &apos;re all different .
Same amount of weight , but different sound colors .
And I just couldn &apos;t quite accept that .
No circumstances at all were used to refuse any entry .
I have the sound coming this way .
He would have the sound coming through the resonators .
If there were no resonators on here , we would have ...
Can you hear anything ?
Exactly . Because I &apos;m not even touching it .
But yet , we get the sensation of something happening .
Do you see what I mean ?
Whatever the eye sees , then there &apos;s always sound happening .
May be great there , but terrible up there .
And this is quite interesting .
In another year &apos;s time , three extra steps .
Those are hugely important aspects to think about .
I &apos;m assuming we &apos;ve all experienced thunder .
Audience : No .
Evelyn Glennie : Well then , stop clapping . Try again .
Try again . Snow .
See , you &apos;re awake .
Rain . Not bad . Not bad .
Now -- great imagination , thank you very much .
Maybe I can use my jewelry to create extra sounds .
So we never , ever dealt with actual study books .
And that &apos;s exactly what he did .
We had to study from study books .
You know . I need to say something .
&quot; Why am I practicing paradiddles ?
They &apos;re experiencing that rawness there .
But thank you very much for having me !
Adam Sadowsky : How to engineer a viral music video
Hi there .
Some of you may recognize this image .
This is the opening frame of the video that we created .
50-million-plus views on YouTube .
A fantastically viral and wonderful video .
So we were really excited about working with them .
They wanted the machine action to follow the song feeling .
They wanted us to make use of the space .
It included an exterior loading dock .
They wanted it messy , and we were happy to oblige .
The machine itself would start the music .
And the machine would maintain synchronization throughout .
Okay .
They wanted it to end precisely on time .
Okay .
The machine itself has 89 distinct interactions .
We destroyed two pianos and 10 televisions in the process .
We went to Home Depot well over a hundred times .
And it &apos;s actually in the machine .
So what did we learn from all of this ?
And we learned that small stuff stinks .
What else ? Planning is incredibly important .
And so while planning is important , so is flexibility .
Again , small to large is relevant here .
Life can be messy .
There were incredibly difficult moments in the building of this thing .
Months were spent in this tiny , cold warehouse .
Thank you very much .
OK Go : An introduction . Hello TEDxUSC .
We are OK Go .
It think we can do better than this . Hello TEDxUSC .
I mean , &quot; Curiosity &quot; -- excuse me .
Let me start again .
Tim &apos;s sundial hat .
Sorry , start again .
Dogs .
That one &apos;s pretty good . It &apos;s getting better .
James Hansen : Why I must speak out about climate change
And what would you do if you knew what I know ?
Let &apos;s start with how I got to this point .
Did it mean that Venus had an ionosphere ?
Or was Venus extremely hot ?
And it was kept hot by a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere .
Its changes will affect all of humanity .
I worked with other scientists to analyze Earth climate observations .
All of these impacts or are now well under way .
There will be stronger storms and greater flooding .
Most of the things mentioned in our 1981 paper were facts .
But energy policies continued to focus on finding more fossil fuels .
By then we had two grandchildren , Sophie and Connor .
But there were consequences .
So the key quantity is Earth &apos;s energy imbalance .
Is there more energy coming in than going out ?
If so , more warming is in the pipeline .
It will occur without adding any more greenhouse gasses .
That &apos;s how much extra energy Earth is gaining each day .
Yet , there was more energy coming in than going out .
Now consider Earth &apos;s climate history .
But that lag is exactly what is expected .
And more CO2 causes more warming .
The physics does not change .
There is evidence that feedbacks are already beginning .
Methane is also beginning to escape from the permafrost .
What sea level rise can we look forward to ?
Where you are sitting now would be under water .
Ice sheets would continue to disintegrate for centuries .
There would be no stable shoreline .
The economic consequences are almost unthinkable .
Hundreds of New Orleans-like devastations around the world .
Global warming is already affecting people .
More grandchildren helped me along .
Jake is a super-positive , enthusiastic boy .
Several top economists are coauthors on this proposition .
Does not enlarge government .
Leaves energy decisions to individual choices .
Sounds like a conservative climate plan . &quot;
A large fraction of species will be committed to extinction .
Imagine a giant asteroid on a direct collision course with Earth .
That is the equivalent of what we face now .
But we aren &apos;t even starting .
Clearly , I haven &apos;t gotten this message across .
The science is clear .
We owe it to our children and grandchildren .
Thank you .
Laura Snyder : The Philosophical Breakfast Club
An elderly , white-haired man stands up .
They &apos;re even more shocked by what he says .
&quot; You must stop calling yourselves natural philosophers . &quot;
The crowd grew angry and began to complain loudly .
What were scientists called before ?
These were brilliant , driven men who accomplished amazing things .
Richard Jones became an important economist who later influenced Karl Marx .
The members of the philosophical breakfast club disagreed .
The philosophical breakfast club changed that , working together .
The four men really helped each other in every way .
It had a separate memory and central processor .
So the philosophical breakfast club helped invent the modern scientist .
That &apos;s the heroic part of their story .
There &apos;s a flip side as well .
They did not foresee at least one consequence of their revolution .
Thank you .
Zach Kaplan + Keith Schacht : Toys and materials from the future
Zach Kaplan : Keith and I lead a research team .
For me , I really love this idea .
Do you have a need for speed ?
Aqua Rocket : coming this summer .
So I just want to quickly explain how this would work .
This is the magnetically-levitating board that they mentioned in the commercial .
Now this is important for two reasons .
Now , you see the magnet fell really slowly .
There &apos;re a few different versions of it .
Some of them automatically unroll like this one .
I &apos;d make my very own walking stick .
An olive server .
Some type of extension pole -- like what the painters use .
You sir , come on up .
Come on up . Tell everybody your name .
Steve Jurvetson : Steve .
Right there . That &apos;s great .
And hold onto this . Good luck to you .
No , not yet .
Little bit -- that &apos;s perfect , just perfect .
SJ : It &apos;s cold .
It &apos;s so safe you could drink this stuff .
All right , well thanks for coming up .
SJ : Excellent , thank you .
So what &apos;s the significance of this dry liquid ?
You can circulate it to draw the heat away .
While he was doing this , he noticed an unexpected thing .
We have a video to show you .
It &apos;s technically called , &quot; shape-retaining property . &quot;
Now , think about your interactions with aluminum foil .
This could totally change the way that you interface with paper .
Old Milk Carton : Oh yeah , it smells good .
Who are you ?
New Milk Carton : I &apos;m New Milk .
OMC : I used to smell like you .
Fresh Watch , from Inventables Dairy Farms .
Packaging that changes color when your milk &apos;s gone off .
Don &apos;t let milk spoil your morning .
And these dyes change color in response to odors .
This can radically improve the way that doctors diagnose patients .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Rose George : Let &apos;s talk crap . Seriously .
Let &apos;s talk dirty .
That &apos;s the other WTO .
2.5 billion people worldwide have no adequate toilet .
They don &apos;t have a bucket or a box .
Forty percent of the world with no adequate toilet .
Fifty communicable diseases like to travel in human shit .
It &apos;s the runs , the Hershey squirts , the squits .
Still not sure about the bikini .
And here &apos;s another image of diarrhea .
This is Marie Saylee , nine months old .
And that &apos;s her dad .
It &apos;s a very potent weapon of mass destruction .
These are cholera beds in Haiti .
But we know how to fix this .
It &apos;s a wonderful waste disposal device .
We don &apos;t have a neutral word for it .
Poop &apos;s not particularly adequate .
Shit offends people . Feces is too medical .
No one &apos;s going to refuse clean water .
So a toilet can put a girl back in school .
And I understand that . Who can blame them ?
That &apos;s not the only thing it can do for you .
Poop can cook your dinner .
It &apos;s got nutrients in it .
We ingest nutrients . We excrete nutrients as well .
We don &apos;t keep them all .
There is now a new career path called stool donor .
It &apos;s like the new sperm donor .
She &apos;s been suffering for years .
It &apos;s astonishing , but hardly anyone is still doing it .
Maybe it &apos;s the ick factor .
So the idea is to manipulate human emotion .
They tried selling soap as healthy . No one bought it .
They tried selling it as sexy . Everyone bought it .
It &apos;s called &quot; No Loo , No I Do . &quot;
She &apos;d grown up with a latrine .
It was no big deal , but it was a latrine .
She was scared of snakes . She was scared of rape .
After three days , she did an unthinkable thing .
She left .
But not just that .
Kids were dying of diarrhea and cholera .
That &apos;s what really made them change their behavior .
But there are things to worry about .
It &apos;s the most off-track Millennium Development Goal .
It &apos;s about 50 or so years off track .
They &apos;ve made it conversational .
People go out and upgrade their toilet .
They talk about it . They &apos;ve sanitized it .
Our sewers are crumbling .
Things are going wrong here too .
The solution to all of this is pretty easy .
Thank you .
Frank Gehry : My days as a young rebel
I &apos;m going to go right into the slides .
Let me go right into the slides .
Can you turn off the light ? Down .
I like to be in the dark .
This is in Venice .
And then I did a law school for Loyola in downtown L.A.
And we continue to work with this client .
They wanted a sense of place .
And the success of it threw me for a loop .
So , nobody would like this .
And after we failed , I just kept failing .
So , it was an accidental discovery .
I got into fish .
And so I started making these funny things .
I did this building in Japan .
And I love sake and Kobe and all that stuff .
And the client said , &quot; Why no fish ? &quot;
But he was right -- I couldn &apos;t do the tail .
It was pretty hard .
And I put them together , and you walk between them .
It was a dialog with the context again .
Couldn &apos;t find it .
So ...
This was built in six months .
We made the drawings of the fish and the scales .
I played with it in the evening .
And the next night , we had gefilte fish .
It was a joke .
I play with funny people like &#91; Claes &#93; Oldenburg .
We &apos;ve been friends for a long time .
And we &apos;ve started to work on things .
He was the Swiss Army knife .
P for Palladio .
The highlight of the performance was at the end .
And I can tell you -- it &apos;s totally an Oldenburg .
I had nothing to do with it .
We made it into a sailing craft .
People hate it .
And I &apos;m always drawn to that .
But Claes made homage to it in the Loyola Law School .
And that chain link is really expensive .
It &apos;s in perspective and everything .
And then we did a camp together for children with cancer .
And you can see , we started making a building together .
Of course , the milk can is his .
And he pushed that .
It made my building look sick .
It led to the building on the left .
I just tell the stories .
And it &apos;s just a complex of factory buildings .
It &apos;s copper and galvanize .
I spent a lot of time undoing Richard Meier &apos;s aesthetic .
And they end up looking like stone .
This is the central area .
There &apos;s a ramp .
Stanley was instrumental in my getting this job .
And so Stanley did the little dome thing .
And we did it over the phone and by fax .
He would send me a fax and show me something .
I don &apos;t want the tower . &quot;
And so I decided to put him in a depression .
And he put these two bridges with pink guardrails on it .
And so then I put this big billboard behind it .
And I call it , &quot; David and Goliath . &quot;
And that &apos;s my cafeteria .
In Boston , we had that old building on the left .
Instead of , like , copper in 10 or 15 .
I flew in one night and took this picture .
And the shape fit perfectly .
I just joined the points .
In the curved part there &apos;s all the mechanical equipment .
This is a small house somewhere .
It &apos;s in the West Valley .
These are the models .
It &apos;s kind of like a whole built town .
I thought it was fitting for me to be doing that .
He was too busy .
He didn &apos;t recommend me , by the way .
Is it going to look like this beautiful estate is sub-divided ?
Etc. etc .
You &apos;ve got the idea .
And so we finally ended up making it .
These people are art collectors .
And the building is very sculptural as you walk around it .
I keep trying to make it work .
In this case we learned how to detail it .
In Cleveland , there &apos;s Burnham Mall , on the left .
It &apos;s never been finished .
There &apos;s a railroad track .
And the centerline of the mall goes out .
You drive down .
So it &apos;s about a 10-story C-clamp .
This owner has a pet peeve about bad automobile entries .
And this would be a hotel .
It &apos;s hard to do high-rise .
I feel much more comfortable down here .
This is a piece of property in Brentwood .
And that &apos;s it , built .
The dome was a request from the client .
She wanted a dome somewhere in the house .
She didn &apos;t care where .
And it &apos;s very private .
The landscape is being built around to create a private garden .
These aren &apos;t focused very well .
I don &apos;t know how to do it from here .
Focus the one on the right .
It &apos;s up there .
Left -- it &apos;s my right .
That &apos;s the living room .
Servants &apos; quarters .
This is the bedroom .
It looks like I got a Baldessari painting for free .
This is for Michael Eisner -- Disney .
We &apos;re doing some work for him .
Kind of a fun thing to do .
And we struggled with the image .
This is in Paris , along the Seine .
Palais des Sports , the Gare de Lyon over here .
There &apos;s a new library across the river .
They call it the plan coupe .
These are the models for it .
Apartments , etc .
And these are the kind of study models we did .
And the one on the left is pretty awful .
The restaurants here -- the apartments and the theater , etc .
And it faces into a park .
And this will be some kind of high-tech billboard .
I don &apos;t know what to do .
And it &apos;s got a fish .
It &apos;s like a drug addict .
And then I do it .
There it is .
But it &apos;s the living room .
We &apos;ve had a lot of fun working together .
So far .
This is a shopping thing .
And another restaurant .
It &apos;s plaster and just zinc .
I know I &apos;m over time .
See , that skylight goes down and becomes that one .
So it &apos;s pretty quiet inside .
This is the Disney Hall -- the concert hall .
It &apos;s a complicated project .
It has a chamber hall .
And the plan of this -- it &apos;s a concert hall .
There &apos;s commercial at the ground floor .
But finally , there &apos;s a hotel there .
And we studied many models .
This was our original model .
Everybody liked the surround .
That &apos;s the idea .
But you get the sense of the hall in section .
Most halls come straight down into a proscenium .
And so it will be quite a different shape .
And this is a teapot I designed for Alessi .
I just stuck it on there .
Larry Halprin is doing the stairs .
And we split these bridges .
Originally , this was all solid with a hole in it .
And finally , I just threw these in -- Lou Danziger .
A little studio -- and it &apos;s sadly for sale .
Time goes on .
It didn &apos;t work .
Thank you very much .
Nicholas Negroponte : Taking OLPC to Colombia
So , in rough numbers , there are a million laptops .
In Colombia , we have about 3,000 laptops .
And suddenly , the kids have connected laptops .
They &apos;ve leapfrogged .
Before , they were closed off .
Now what are some of the results ?
Probably the most important thing we see is children teaching parents .
They own the laptops . They take them home .
Her mother had not gone to primary school .
This is an education project , not a laptop project .
And then we can actually roll out large numbers .
And think of the laptop as a vaccine .
You don &apos;t vaccinate a few children .
You vaccinate all the children in an area .
Nate Silver : Does racism affect how you vote ?
I want to talk about the election .
And in fact Barack Obama did quite well .
He won 375 electoral votes .
One exception is in Massachusetts .
That was John Kerry &apos;s home state .
He lost badly but every Democrat does .
He lost no worse than most people do .
But yeah , what &apos;s the matter with Arkansas ?
And the answer is : it is at least partially fair .
They asked this question .
Here is the same data on a map .
So we have to ask why .
Is racism predictable in some way ?
Is there something driving this ?
Or are there more systematic factors at work ?
And so we can look at a bunch of different variables .
And you see the relationship there with the racially-based voting patterns .
So yes , racism is predictable .
This is conducted by the University of Chicago every other year .
And they ask a series of really interesting questions .
In 2000 they had particularly interesting questions about racial attitudes .
There is a big difference .
Just based on who lives in your immediate neighborhood around you .
So it &apos;s really not even about urban versus rural .
It &apos;s about who you live with .
I &apos;m a big fan of cities .
So we can think more about things like street grids .
Denis Dutton : A Darwinian theory of beauty
It &apos;s in the eye of the beholder .
It &apos;s whatever moves you personally .
Beethoven is adored in Japan .
Peruvians love Japanese woodblock prints .
How can we explain this universality ?
I mean fossils , cave paintings and so forth .
It did not evolve for natural survival .
In fact , it goes against natural survival .
It &apos;s quite a familiar story .
It &apos;s women who actually push history forward .
He actually used that word .
It would hardly do to eat your baby or your lover .
But , someone might argue , that &apos;s natural beauty .
How about artistic beauty ?
Isn &apos;t that exhaustively cultural ?
No , I don &apos;t think it is .
But artistic and decorative skills are actually much older than that .
But the most intriguing prehistoric artifacts are older even than this .
I have in mind the so-called Acheulian hand axes .
They go back about two-and-a-half-million years .
What were these artifacts for ?
Yes , hairstyling -- I insist on that .
We find beauty in something done well .
Is beauty in the eye of the beholder ?
No , it &apos;s deep in our minds .
Thank you .
Once upon a time , there was a place called Lesterland .
Now Lesterland looks a lot like the United States .
Now , Lesters in Lesterland have this extraordinary power .
There are two elections every election cycle in Lesterland .
One is called the general election .
The other is called the Lester election .
And here &apos;s the trick .
Now , what can we say about democracy in Lesterland ?
Okay . That &apos;s Lesterland .
Number one , the United States is Lesterland .
The United States is Lesterland .
But you must do extremely well .
Now you say , really ?
Really .05 percent ?
In this sense , the funders are our Lesters .
Now , what can we say about this democracy in USA-land ?
Okay , the United States is Lesterland , point number one .
Here &apos;s point number two .
I don &apos;t mean Rod Blagojevich sense of corruption .
I don &apos;t mean any criminal act .
The corruption I &apos;m talking about is perfectly legal .
So here &apos;s the model of government .
This is a corruption .
So the right wants smaller government .
But here &apos;s the bad news .
Block reform .
It feeds on dysfunction .
This is the root .
Okay , now , every single one of you knows this .
You ignore it . This is an impossible problem .
But we cannot ignore this corruption anymore .
We need a government that works .
There will never be a Christmas .
Okay . So how do we do it ?
Turns out , the analytics here are easy , simple .
The analytics are easy here .
Now I get this skepticism .
I get this cynicism . I get this sense of impossibility .
But I don &apos;t buy it .
This is a solvable issue .
You don &apos;t wake up one day no longer a racist .
But this is a problem of just incentives , just incentives .
Irrelevant .
There &apos;s nothing we can do . &quot;
When she said that , I scrambled .
What is that sense of hopelessness ? &quot;
And what hit me was an image of my six-year-old son .
Nothing you can do . &quot;
So would I do nothing ?
I &apos;m going off to build Google Glass .
So here &apos;s my question : Do you have that love ?
Do you have that love ?
A republic . A representative democracy .
A government dependent upon the people alone .
We have lost that republic .
All of us have to act to get it back .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
Gary Greenberg : The beautiful nano details of our world
As we go smaller , here is a human hair .
It &apos;s about a tenth of a millimeter .
That &apos;s how small that is .
This is a ring of cobalt atoms .
So sand is about a tenth of a millimeter in size .
It &apos;s really quite amazing . You have microshells there .
You have things like coral .
You have fragments of other shells . You have olivine .
An amazing array of incredible things exist in sand .
There &apos;s some sand that &apos;s really much more colorful .
Every grain of sand is coming somewhere and going somewhere .
They &apos;re like a snapshot in time .
And you can see those in micrometeorites .
And I started taking pictures with my three-dimensional microscopes .
So sort of left-eye view , right-eye view .
And that &apos;s called a ring agglutinate .
Thank you .
Edith Widder : The weird , wonderful world of bioluminescence
But mostly I &apos;m entranced by it .
I needed some way to share the experience directly .
This is the first time it has ever been recorded .
Oops . Sorry .
Okay .
Well , it uses it to defend itself from its predators .
The flash is like a scream for help .
It &apos;s got a light organ under its eye .
It &apos;s got a chin barbel .
It &apos;s unbelievable .
The light organs under the eyes are flashing .
That chin barbel is flashing .
It &apos;s phenomenal .
There &apos;s other ways you can defend yourself with light .
This blinds or distracts the predator .
It &apos;s phenomenal .
They &apos;re things like this .
This is a golden coral , a bush .
It grows very slowly .
The other reason is this amazing bush glows .
And you see things like this .
And these are flytrap anemones .
Now if you poke it , it pulls in its tentacles .
And it actually ends up looking like a galaxy .
There are starfish that can make light .
Colorization and sound effects added for you viewing pleasure .
But we have no idea why it does that .
Here &apos;s another one . This is also a sea pen .
It &apos;s got a brittle star hitching a ride .
It &apos;s a green saber of light .
This is an optical lure that I &apos;ve used .
We call it the electronic jellyfish .
So the camera &apos;s black and white .
It &apos;s not high-resolution .
And right in the front is the electronic jellyfish .
There &apos;s something small there that responds .
We &apos;re talking to something .
And this was very consistent .
This was in the Bahamas at about 2,000 feet .
But the cool thing is , we &apos;re talking to it .
We don &apos;t know what we &apos;re saying .
Personally , I think it &apos;s something sexy .
We &apos;ve only just begun to analyze all of this data .
That &apos;s a 12-foot-long giant sixgill shark .
And this is a burglar alarm .
This is at 3,000 feet in Monterey Canyon .
It &apos;s supposed to be attacking what &apos;s attacking the jellyfish .
But we did see a bunch of responses like this .
This guy is a little more contemplative .
&quot; Hey , wait a minute .
There &apos;s supposed to be something else there . &quot;
He &apos;s thinking about it .
But he &apos;s persistent .
He keeps coming back .
Nope .
We need more eyes on the process .
But I warn you , it &apos;s addictive .
Thank you .
Vusi Mahlasela : &quot; Thula Mama &quot;
This is your place , you stay here . &quot;
And they left .
Gary Lauder &apos;s new traffic sign : Take Turns
I &apos;ve had some time to think it over .
Fifty percent of crashes happen at intersections .
Roundabouts are much better .
But that &apos;s just safety .
What about time and gas ?
Small roundabouts are starting to appear .
But they are not applicable in all situations .
So , take , for example , the three-way intersection .
But the other two are somewhat questionable .
Cars rarely appear on that third road .
What &apos;s that time worth ?
is $ 20 an hour . That is 60,000 per year .
And you &apos;d still come out ahead .
Can that be accomplished with existing signs ?
So , why not use a yield sign ?
That would not work .
And it merges the stop sign and yield signs .
And uncertainty results in caution .
So , now that you are all &quot; Road Scholars &quot; ...
Maira Kalman : The illustrated woman
And I was writing terrible poetry and knitting sweaters for him .
And we started a studio .
You have to condense a story into 32 pages , usually .
And the Bertoia chair in the background is my favorite chair .
And the books are really journals of my life .
I never -- I don &apos;t like plots .
I don &apos;t know what a plot means .
The letter C had other things in it .
Who are these people ? What are these tribes ?
They &apos;re not . &quot;
I said , people should know about this book .
Do you mind my asking a question ? &quot;
I happen to know it for a fact .
You don &apos;t even know .
&quot; And decided his top people had to be extinctified . &quot;
Too many pogroms .
Facts were actually banished from our home .
So , it &apos;s a miracle that I &apos;m here today .
Well , not so awful .
There &apos;s consoling .
And he says , &quot; It is impossible not to lie .
It is February and not lying is impossible . &quot;
How do we know when we are ourselves ?
I &apos;m going to quickly go through this .
A complicated question .
Oh my God , you know what ?
Could we have -- no , we don &apos;t have time .
Do you have that ?
And she said , &quot; I knew it was he . &quot;
Gershwin died at the age of 38 .
He &apos;s buried in the same cemetery as my husband .
I don &apos;t want to talk about that now .
And I would like to run it for them .
And a woman who lives on our street , Lolita .
And then I go and have some tea .
That &apos;s actually Hy .
Gabe Barcia-Colombo : My DNA vending machine
This is a vending machine in Los Angeles .
It &apos;s a caviar vending machine .
You can kind of tell from their reactions .
And so I started doing this regularly .
This is what that looked like .
And I hadn &apos;t even thought about that .
And so I thought that was interesting .
Here it is .
And how much will these samples be worth ?
And will you buy someone else &apos;s sample ?
And what will you be able to do with that sample ?
Thank you .
Dan Dennett : The illusion of consciousness
But they probably don &apos;t think of these opinions as expertise .
They &apos;re just strongly held opinions .
Simply by being conscious , I know all about this . &quot;
No , you &apos;ve got it all wrong . &quot;
And they say this with an amazing confidence .
That &apos;s the order of the day here .
Now , this nice picture shows a thought-balloon , a thought-bubble .
I think everybody understands what that means .
That &apos;s supposed to exhibit the stream of consciousness .
And this fellow here is looking at the painting by Braque .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re made of .
It speaks so eloquently to the problem .
Real consciousness is not a bag of tricks .
Don &apos;t tell me the answer . &quot;
But I &apos;m not going to explain it all to you .
I &apos;m going to do what philosophers do .
Here &apos;s how a philosopher explains the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick .
You know the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick ?
&quot; He merely makes you think that he does . &quot;
So now I &apos;m going to illustrate how philosophers explain consciousness .
He didn &apos;t even try to do those things .
People &apos;s memories inflate what they think they saw .
And the same is true of consciousness .
Watch it carefully .
We &apos;re looking for a backer .
It &apos;s a feature-length documentary on consciousness .
OK , now , you all saw what changed , right ?
That &apos;s the detail part .
It doesn &apos;t seem that way , does it ?
You &apos;re getting in a lot less information than you think .
It &apos;s in the museum in North Carolina .
Bellotto was a student of Canaletto &apos;s .
And as I got closer and closer , I actually screamed .
There were just little artfully placed blobs of paint .
I &apos;ll just give that to you one more time .
Well , remember the philosopher &apos;s explanation of the lady ?
It &apos;s the same thing .
It &apos;s just making you expect the detail .
Let &apos;s just do this experiment very quickly .
Yes .
How do you know that &apos;s what you did ?
Yes , it &apos;s possible to do that .
But the details of the process are still in significant controversy .
You don &apos;t know how you do it .
You just know that you have certain beliefs .
And what explains the fact that that &apos;s what you think ?
Can you see it ?
It &apos;s a Necker cube .
Can you see the four ways of seeing the cube ?
Because there &apos;s another way of seeing it .
Does your brain have to send little painters in there ?
But Rob Van Lier has recently shown that it isn &apos;t .
Let me just pause this for a second if I can .
This is change-blindness .
So , show the original picture for 240 milliseconds . Blank .
Show the next picture for 240 milliseconds . Blank .
So now we &apos;re going to be subjects in the experiment .
We &apos;re going to start easy . Some examples .
No trouble there .
Can everybody see ? All right .
Can you see that one ?
2.9 seconds .
How many don &apos;t see it still ?
What &apos;s on the roof of that barn ?
It &apos;s easy .
Is it a bridge or a dock ?
I want you to see a few that are particularly striking .
Can you see it ?
Audience : Yes .
How many engines on the wing of that Boeing ?
Right in the middle of the picture !
Thanks very much for your attention .
And he &apos;s right . This is a problem .
If you work on one neuron , that &apos;s neuroscience .
If you work on two neurons , that &apos;s psychology . &quot;
Thank you very much .
Actually , it &apos;s deceptively large .
Obviously a very small community .
There were only two other Dannys on the Internet then .
I knew them both .
So I could have anything I wanted other than bbn.com and symbolics.com.
Maybe I should register a few extras just in case .
It was incredibly successful .
My rough calculation is it would be about 25 miles thick .
I &apos;ll come back to that later .
Now , there was an interesting thing that happened last April .
So for a few hours , it all passed through China .
Imagine how vulnerable the system is to deliberate attacks .
That will not succeed .
Nobody has claimed credit for that .
There was basically a factory of industrial machines .
It didn &apos;t think of itself as being on the Internet .
Everything started breaking .
Now , of course you couldn &apos;t do that today .
It &apos;s constantly changing . It &apos;s constantly reconfiguring .
But so what we need is a plan B.
There is no plan B right now .
This doesn &apos;t need to be a multi-billion-dollar government project .
It &apos;s basically a matter of deciding to do it .
It &apos;s not that hard a problem .
It could definitely be done by people in this room .
Thank you very much .
Stefan Larsson : What doctors can learn from each other
It &apos;s a big part of the national budgets .
And many different reforms aim at holding back this growth .
So no wonder that some of my old colleagues are frustrated .
We call this value-based healthcare .
The differences were dramatic .
That &apos;s a huge difference , a seven-fold difference .
And often , the data actually doesn &apos;t exist .
Nobody knows .
So going the hospital is a lottery .
They all realized they had their individual way of operating .
And they finally agreed .
Everybody saw this makes a lot of sense .
Since then , they publish every year .
Now I found this principle really exciting .
Continuous improvement .
Now , that &apos;s not the only exciting part .
That &apos;s exciting in itself .
We did a study where we looked at OECD data .
They were always best in class .
We were always best in class .
But most of them don &apos;t know .
But physicians have another characteristic .
They actually thrive from peer recognition .
They will share the information on how to improve .
This is happening in reality .
It stands for the International Consortium for Health Outcome Measurement .
Compare apples to apples . Who &apos;s better ?
Why is that ?
The group discussed , how do we measure quality today ?
Can we measure it better than we do ?
There was an enormous energy in the room .
There were so many ideas , so much enthusiasm .
Thank you .
Brian Cox : Why we need the explorers
We live in difficult and challenging economic times , of course .
This is the U.K. government spend .
You see there , it &apos;s about 620 billion a year .
That funds everything in the U.K.
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re arguing about .
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re arguing about .
So it isn &apos;t in the series .
It &apos;s of the moon Enceladus .
It &apos;s about 500 kilometers in diameter .
So , tiny moon .
What &apos;s fascinating and beautiful ...
It &apos;s a beautiful graphic .
That &apos;s one more picture of Enceladus .
This is when Cassini flew beneath Enceladus .
It &apos;s actually an ice moon .
It could be hundreds of kilometers deep , we think .
Tremendous and beautiful discovery .
Well , there is .
Earthrise from Apollo 8 .
The biggest one was in 1975 by Chase Econometrics .
So exploration can pay for itself .
What about scientific discovery ?
What about driving innovation ?
Well , this looks like a picture of virtually nothing .
And they saw strange pictures like this .
And the electrons can only be in particular places .
I just wanted to show this picture because this is remarkable .
This is actually a picture of the spectrum of the Sun .
But look at the number of black lines in that spectrum .
And that &apos;s why helium &apos;s called helium .
It &apos;s called &quot; helios &quot; -- helios from the Sun .
That &apos;s a limit imposed on the mass of stars .
That &apos;s quite an incredible prediction .
Well , this is a picture of it .
It &apos;s just one of billions of galaxies in the universe .
So that star is also 50 million light years away .
That &apos;s a Type Ia supernova explosion .
It &apos;s called a carbon-oxygen dwarf .
In fact , that one is a carbon-oxygen dwarf .
So , I think science can be -- serendipity is important .
It can be beautiful . It can reveal quite astonishing things .
This is a spectacular picture of our home planet .
Now , it doesn &apos;t look like our home planet .
It looks like Saturn because , of course , it is .
It was taken by the Cassini space probe .
And if I blow it up there , you see it .
That &apos;s our planet from 750 million miles away .
The Voyager is a tiny machine .
But it visited Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus and Neptune .
And it took this picture of Earth .
That &apos;s Earth from four billion miles away .
He said , &quot; Consider again that dot .
That &apos;s here . That &apos;s home . That &apos;s us .
Beautiful words about the power of science and exploration .
And it &apos;s made today in these difficult economic times .
Surely , we know enough .
We don &apos;t need to discover anything else about our universe .
He was clearly under assault all the time .
&quot; We know enough at the turn of the 19th century .
Just exploit it ; just build things . &quot;
Thank you .
Janna Levin : The sound the universe makes
The Sun burns our peripheral vision .
We see light reflected off the Moon .
Now black holes are dark against a dark sky .
We can &apos;t see them directly .
They destroy stars around them .
They churn up debris in their surroundings .
But they won &apos;t come to us directly through light .
It was Einstein &apos;s great general theory of relativity .
Now even light will be bent by those paths .
These are the natural curves in space .
And even light could not escape this current .
This is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions .
But Einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical oddity .
He did not believe they existed in nature .
He thought nature would protect us from their formation .
Now our Sun will not collapse to a black hole .
It &apos;s actually not massive enough .
But basically that &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about .
It cannot hide behind the black hole .
So you can &apos;t hide anything behind a black hole .
They can see you .
They can be spinning hundreds of times a second .
This was one of the groups .
You would literally hear the sound .
And we can predict what the sound will be .
Then it &apos;s gone .
At home it sounds kind of anticlimactic .
It &apos;s sort of like ding , ding , ding .
This is another sound from my group .
Want to get away from the sound .
Both black holes are moving .
Both black holes are getting closer together .
In this case , they &apos;re both wobbling quite a lot .
And then they &apos;re going to merge .
Now it &apos;s gone .
Now that &apos;s our prediction for what we &apos;ll see .
In this Hubble image , we see two galaxies .
They look like they &apos;re frozen in some embrace .
But they &apos;re not frozen ; they &apos;re actually merging .
It might make a sound .
So imagine you &apos;re inside the Big Bang .
Imagine a billion years ago , two black holes collided .
That song has been ringing through space for all that time .
We weren &apos;t even here .
It &apos;s like hurry , build your instruments .
It &apos;s getting closer and closer , and in 20 ...
It &apos;s a terrible sound .
It &apos;s literally the definition of noise .
It &apos;s white noise ; it &apos;s such a chaotic ringing .
I mean we have to ask , has it happened before ?
Will it happen again ?
Here &apos;s my multiverse creatures .
Thank you . Thank you .
Joe Kowan : How I beat stage fright
Joe Kowan : I have stage fright .
And it didn &apos;t even matter until I was 27 .
I had this irrational fear .
Well , when I got there , it was packed .
There were like 20 people there .
And they all looked angry .
Next your non-essential systems start to shut down , like digestion .
That condition is not conducive to performing folk music .
I mean , your nervous system is an idiot .
I have never been more terrified -- until now .
I mean , it &apos;s a nightmare .
It was so bad .
But that was my first real experience as a solo singer-songwriter .
I couldn &apos;t shake it .
And that &apos;s when I had an epiphany .
So I started writing a song about having stage fright .
Except for when I was really nervous , like now .
Can I have a sip of water ?
Thank you .
Alan Kay : A powerful idea about ideas
He would have a great time .
We go to magic shows in order to be fooled .
They measure very , very carefully .
Somehow we have to understand ourselves to get around our flaws .
We can think of ourselves as kind of a noisy channel .
I &apos;ll talk about that a little bit .
But how simple ?
And that leaves two open areas that are kind of suspicious ...
and bingo . That is all you have to do .
Now let &apos;s go to young children .
You can see the trapezoids are a little challenging there .
So they had created these artifacts .
&quot; What have you noticed about what you did ? &quot;
So that &apos;s what Lauren did .
Well , that &apos;s pretty amazing .
That isn &apos;t what we usually try to teach six-year-olds .
Each time I click it , car turn .
And I can try steering the car here by ...
See the car turn by five here ?
So what if I click this down to zero ?
It goes straight . That &apos;s a big revelation for nine-year-olds .
Make it go in the other direction .
And we &apos;ll call this a wheel .
See this wheel &apos;s heading here ?
And it &apos;s interesting .
And we can reflect here the way Gillian Ishijima did .
What do I get there ? &quot;
We get a visual pattern of what these nine-year-olds called acceleration .
So how do the children do science ?
Student 1 : Ooh , this is nice .
Who &apos;s got the apple ?
Alan Kay : They &apos;ve got little stopwatches .
AK : Stopwatches aren &apos;t accurate enough .
Student 3 : 0.99 seconds .
Teacher : So put &quot; sponge ball &quot; ...
Teacher : Drop . Class : Whoa !
And they say , &quot; Oh , yeah . Constant acceleration .
We &apos;ve done that already . &quot;
But if I oppose gravity , here we go ... Oops !
One more .
Thank you .
Rives : If I controlled the Internet
I just wish it were more organized . &quot;
So ...
You could navigate and understand every emotional intersection .
Listen , you &apos;ll see being dead is dandy .
Now follow me , OK ?
Grandma.com would be a recipe for biscuits and spit-bath instructions .
One , two , three .
That links with hotdiggitydog.com.
That is my grandfather .
They take you to gruff-ex-cop-on-his-fourth-marriage.dad.
I wouldn &apos;t need it .
Huh ? Maybe Google would hire this .
I guess it &apos;s just like life .
We can interfere with the interface .
You don &apos;t say a prayer .
You don &apos;t write a psalm .
You don &apos;t chant an &quot; om . &quot;
Thank you , TED .
Bill Davenhall : Your health depends on where you live
Can geographic information make you healthy ?
In 2001 I got hit by a train .
My train was a heart attack .
&quot; Why now ? &quot; &quot; Why here ? &quot;
&quot; Could my doctor have warned me ? &quot;
Genetics , lifestyle and environment .
Well , I understand the genetics and lifestyle part .
And you know why I understand that ?
Because my physicians constantly ask me questions about this .
What does that mean , my environment ?
Well , it can mean a lot of things .
This is my life . These are my life places .
We all have these .
You spend it at rest and you spend it at work .
I started off in Scranton , Pennsylvania .
OK , so I ended up in Louisville , Kentucky .
They manufacture plastics . They use large quantities chloroprene and benzene .
It was insidious and it was really happening .
And I moved to Redlands California .
Okay ? Almost like the highest in the nation .
So , what &apos;s wrong with this picture ?
They really don &apos;t do that . It &apos;s missing .
Look at the kind of data that &apos;s available .
Now , I &apos;ve circled the places where I &apos;ve been .
So , how many people are in the white ?
Anybody ? Boy you &apos;re lucky .
How many have spent it in the red places ?
Oh , not so lucky .
But none of that &apos;s in my medical record .
And it &apos;s not in yours either .
So , here &apos;s my friend Paul .
And this is where he has spent most of his time .
Anybody got any clues ? Ski . Right .
Did you know that data existed ?
So , our cell phones can now build a place history .
This might be what we end up with .
This could be my little assessment .
What I &apos;d like to leave you for are two prescriptions .
And they &apos;re in the early stages of development .
But it will also be useful for us .
Just look at that for a minute .
That was what he was talking about on that quote .
Gary Wolf : The quantified self
I got up this morning at 6 : 10 a.m.
after going to sleep at 12 : 45 a.m.
I was awakened once during the night .
I had about 600 milligrams of caffeine , zero of alcohol .
This little black dot there is a 3D accelerometer .
It tracks your movement through space .
This tracks your activity and also your sleep .
It has just that sensor in it .
You &apos;re probably familiar with the Nike + system .
And this is the sleep tracking system of today .
This just was presented at a health care conference in D.C.
Here &apos;s a biometric device : a pair of Apple Earbuds .
What is this for ?
What should it be for ?
Some people will say it &apos;s for biometric security .
Some people will say it &apos;s for public health research .
Some people will say it &apos;s for avant-garde marketing research .
Thank you .
You have to make a wish to save the world . &quot;
I was lost .
The world is fucked up .
Except maybe French people .
Whatever .
I can &apos;t do anything to save the world . &quot;
&quot; Oh , all right . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s cool . &quot;
What about art ?
Could art change the world ?
I started when I was 15 years old .
Each trip was an excursion , was an adventure .
I would control it directly with the public in the streets .
So that &apos;s Paris .
That &apos;s on the Champs-Elysees .
I was quite proud of that one .
Then when the photo left , the frame was still there .
November 2005 : the streets are burning .
I mean , these were the faces of my friends .
I know those guys .
So I went back there with a 28 mm lens .
It was the only one I had at that time .
So you can do it only with their trust .
So I took full portraits of people from Le Bosquet .
They were making scary faces to play the caricature of themselves .
That &apos;s where I realized the power of paper and glue .
So could art change the world ?
Are they so different ?
Asked them to make a face as a sign of commitment .
They all accepted to be pasted next to the other .
We launched the biggest illegal art exhibition ever .
We called the project Face 2 Face .
The experts said , &quot; No way .
The people will not accept .
&quot; It will be as big as your house . &quot;
When we did the wall , we did the Palestinian side .
We had all sorts of help from all walks of life .
Okay , for example , that &apos;s Palestine .
We &apos;re in Ramallah right now .
And those ones are actually two taxi-drivers . &quot;
And then there was always a silence .
And most of them couldn &apos;t say .
We even pasted on Israeli military towers , and nothing happened .
The rain and the wind will take them off anyway .
They are not meant to stay .
So the reactions in the street were kind of interesting .
I called that project Women Are Heroes .
I just observed .
Sometimes there was no words , no sentence , just tears .
I just took their pictures and pasted them .
Women Are Heroes took me around the world .
I was shocked .
All Brazil was shocked .
So I decided to go there .
And she said , &quot; You know what ?
We &apos;re hungry for culture .
We need culture out there . &quot;
So I went out and I started with the kids .
But that &apos;s okay .
I wanted them to feel that this art belongs to them .
They were all linked to the three kids that got killed .
I took more photos , and we started the project .
I &apos;m not interested in filming the violence and the weapons .
You see that enough in the media .
What I want to show is the incredible life and energy .
Everyone there understood the project .
And then we pasted everywhere -- the whole hill .
What was interesting is that the media couldn &apos;t get in .
I mean , you should see that .
So how can we know about the project ?
We kept traveling .
In war-torn places like Monrovia , people come straight to you .
Are you an NGO ? Are you the media ? &quot;
Art . Just doing art .
Don &apos;t you have color in France ? &quot;
Some who understood the project would explain it to others .
This is art . &quot;
And then it becomes more .
It becomes a desire , a need , an armor .
Women are always the first ones targeted during conflict .
Then art becomes useful .
So the people kept it .
So I asked the people what happened .
&quot; Oh , that guy just moved . &quot;
When you look at Kibera now , they look back .
Okay , India .
In India it was just impossible to paste .
So we decided to paste white , white on the walls .
So imagine white guys pasting white papers .
Of course , they were confused .
Thank you .
So we didn &apos;t get caught this time .
Each project -- that &apos;s a film from Women Are Heroes .
Okay .
For each project we do a film .
And the photos kept traveling even without us .
Behind each image is a story .
We did that in most of the places .
We go back regularly .
In Kibera , each year we cover more roofs .
And that has always been a central part of the work .
And I was even invited to cover the MOCA museum .
But tell me , advertising for what ?
But they asked me for a promise basically .
So I did . That &apos;s Paris .
That &apos;s Rio .
You understand the full scope of the project .
That &apos;s London .
New York .
And today , they are with you in Long Beach .
In some ways , art can change the world .
Art can change the way we see the world .
Art can create an analogy .
They would be really useful . &quot;
Or , &quot; How can we help ? &quot;
And this starts right now .
Yes , everyone in the room .
Everyone watching .
I wanted that wish to actually start now .
What we see changes who we are .
And this starts right now and depends on you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Suzanne Lee : Grow your own clothes
So we start by brewing the tea .
And then we &apos;re ready to add the living organism .
And along with that , some acetic acid .
We need to maintain an optimum temperature for the growth .
So this is my mini fabric farm .
So they &apos;re spinning these tiny nano fibers of pure cellulose .
And this is a static culture .
It doesn &apos;t need light .
At this point , it &apos;s really heavy .
So I spread it out onto a wooden sheet .
Using fruit and vegetable staining , create organic patterning .
And using indigo , make it anti-microbial .
What I can &apos;t yet do is make it water-resistant .
Align it in this direction .
Make it hydrophobic .
What excites me about using microbes is their efficiency .
So we only grow what we need .
There &apos;s no waste .
Thank you very much .
This is one of the jackets you grew ?
SL : Yes , it is .
Suzanne Lee .
Jon Nguyen : Tour the solar system from home
I would watch Nova on PBS .
Our school would show Bill Nye the Science Guy .
So what you &apos;re looking at right now is the Earth .
Google Earth goes from this view down to your backyard .
We go from this view out to the stars .
These are a number of our science space Earth orbiters .
All right , so what about the rest of it ?
It &apos;s actually pretty busy .
Here we have Juno on its cruise to Jupiter , there .
You can see how it &apos;s tilted at about 89 degrees .
So now we &apos;ve gone back in time .
We &apos;re now riding along with Voyager 1 .
The date here is November 11 , 1980 .
Now , there &apos;s a funny thing going on here .
It doesn &apos;t look like anything &apos;s going on .
It looks like I &apos;ve paused the program .
It actually has a very thick atmosphere .
There &apos;s a point to be made here .
There &apos;s a whole story to tell here .
If you want to pause it , you can pause it .
It actually flies underneath Saturn .
You can manipulate it yourself .
You can fly around yourself and you can learn for yourself .
Thank you .
Quixotic Fusion : Dancing with light
Andreas Raptopoulos : No roads ? There &apos;s a drone for that
One billion people .
Could we do the same for transportation ?
Imagine this scenario .
What would you do today ?
That &apos;s the part that works .
That &apos;s the part that &apos;s broken .
It &apos;s an ultra-flexible , automated logistics network .
It &apos;s a network for a transportation of matter .
We call it Matternet .
We use three key technologies .
The first is electric autonomous flying vehicles .
First of all , the UAVs .
Today , we &apos;re using small quads .
These fly autonomously .
This is the key to the technology .
The ground stations are located on safe locations on the ground .
People there love this .
So this is a $ 3,000 vehicle .
Costs are coming down very rapidly .
The next big question is , what &apos;s the cost ?
Compare this to normal infrastructure investments .
It can be used perhaps in other places in the world .
Half of the Earth &apos;s population lives in cities today .
Half a billion of us live in megacities .
We are living through an amazing urbanization trend .
Congestion is a huge problem .
So why are we doing this ?
Thank you .
Rives : Reinventing the encyclopedia game
So I tried .
You can start anywhere , this time I chose Earth .
And the first rule of the game is pretty simple .
And it is really fun to say .
You can use it at TED .
Chimborazo , right ?
I didn &apos;t know that ; that &apos;s pretty cool .
Chimborazo !
So the next rule of the game is also pretty simple .
You just have to find another term and look that up .
Nowadays there are hundreds of links to choose from .
They move ; they go up , they go down .
I didn &apos;t know it .
Chimborazo !
Famous for its diversity , human diversity .
This is the most successful order on the planet by far .
Statistically , one of you is a beetle .
And if it is you , you are astonishingly well adapted .
Fireflies are not flies , fireflies are beetles .
Like my next link : The chemical language of pheromones .
Yeah .
And the link to aphrodisiac .
Now that &apos;s something that increases sexual desire , possibly chocolate .
But not when they &apos;re together like that .
I do like sympathy . I do like magic .
This is the boy in me getting lucky again .
Sympathetic magic is imitation .
We &apos;ve got tens-of-thousands-years-old artwork .
He doesn &apos;t .
He lives in rainforests and savannas .
Germans occupied Russia .
You can come back to Earth .
You return to where you started .
You can finish your game .
I found it myself .
It &apos;s got some math that I can do .
I &apos;m pretty sure my dad doesn &apos;t know it .
That &apos;s pretty cool .
I didn &apos;t know that .
Chimborazo !
Thank you .
Fiorenzo Omenetto : Silk , the ancient material of the future
Thank you .
I &apos;m thrilled to be here .
So that &apos;s kind of a bold statement .
I &apos;ll tell you a little bit more .
It actually gets reintegrated in the body .
And the material looks something like this .
In fact , this material you see is clear and transparent .
The components of this material are just water and protein .
So this material is silk .
The process of discovery , generally , is inspired by nature .
And so we get this starting material .
And we take advantage of something that is very simple .
They find their way to self-assemble .
But I mentioned that the film is also technological .
And so what does that mean ?
So let me see .
It &apos;s actually not limited to films .
And so the material can assume a lot of formats .
You can add a third dimensionality to the film .
But you can do other things .
But silk is versatile and it goes beyond optics .
And you can think of different formats .
You can do bigger things .
And the gears work in water as well .
So you think of alternative mechanical parts .
You can do electronic pieces that fold and wrap .
Or if you &apos;re fashion forward , some silk LED tattoos .
But there are still some unique traits .
And you see here a picture of a tissue section .
And you see there , it gets reintegrated in tissue .
So it makes the materials environmentally active and interactive .
So we &apos;ve made a silk card with penicillin in it .
And so what you see there is the difference .
Thank you .
Sandra Aamodt : Why dieting doesn &apos;t usually work
I &apos;m sure many of you know the feeling .
That &apos;s what a thermostat does , right ?
That &apos;s a lot of food .
Successful dieting doesn &apos;t lower your set point .
Sadly , a temporary weight gain can become permanent .
Let &apos;s call them intuitive eaters and controlled eaters .
So don &apos;t do that .
Now let &apos;s look at what happens in overweight people .
But a healthy lifestyle helps obese people too .
Diets don &apos;t have very much reliability .
Forty percent of them have gained even more .
And my answer , in a word , is mindfulness .
How do you do it ?
Sit down to regular meals without distractions .
I often don &apos;t think about it .
I forget we have chocolate in the house .
It &apos;s like aliens have taken over my brain .
It &apos;s just completely different .
Let me leave you with one last thought .
Thanks .
Lee Cronin : Print your own medicine
In essence , could we &quot; app &quot; chemistry ?
Now what could this mean ?
So how are we doing this in the lab ?
So what could this mean ?
You don &apos;t need to go to the chemist anymore .
We can print drugs at point of need .
We can download new diagnostics .
Say a new super bug has emerged .
So this allows you on-the-fly molecular assembly .
Beam me up , Scotty .
Eli Pariser : Beware online &quot; filter bubbles &quot;
It meant a connection to the world .
It meant something that would connect us all together .
They disappeared .
Google &apos;s doing it too .
So here &apos;s my friend Scott &apos;s screen shot .
And here &apos;s my friend Daniel &apos;s screen shot .
Scott &apos;s results were full of them .
That &apos;s how different these results are becoming .
So it &apos;s not just Google and Facebook either .
This is something that &apos;s sweeping the Web .
So I do think this is a problem .
They enter the queue , they just zip right out .
So the best editing gives us a bit of both .
But that &apos;s not actually what &apos;s happening right now .
Then people noticed that they were doing something really important .
We need it to connect us all together .
Thank you .
Alan Russell : The potential of regenerative medicine
There are words that we &apos;re truly afraid of .
It was basically a regenerative medicine issue .
Regenerative medicine is an extraordinarily simple concept that everybody can understand .
This is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine .
This is not regenerative medicine .
And this is just the same .
We &apos;ve come a long way since then .
Why is this important ?
And why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now ?
Just have a look at the demographics in the U.S. here .
This is from &quot; The Untied States of America . &quot;
In 1930 , there were 41 workers per retiree .
In 2010 , two workers per retiree in the U.S.
This is age versus cost of health care .
All those things do is change who pays .
You can prevent .
Obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention .
Think of it in terms of diabetes , for instance .
Today , with diabetes , what do we do ?
And we do OK . Insulin &apos;s a pretty good therapy .
This is a newt re-growing its limb .
It &apos;s a wild concept .
But it &apos;s applicable , again , to every organ system .
How can we do that ?
We need to learn to speak the body &apos;s language .
The first is cellular therapies .
Secondly , we can use materials .
We heard yesterday about the importance of new materials .
And he asked a very important question .
What I &apos;m about to show you is a diabetic ulcer .
This is the reality of diabetes .
This is a diabetic ulcer . It &apos;s tragic .
The treatment for this is amputation .
That &apos;s what the wound looked like 11 weeks later .
That material contained only natural signals .
This is a horse . The horse is not in pain .
Here &apos;s a dolphin where the fin &apos;s been re-attached .
Could you regenerate a limb ?
And I &apos;ll show you the 15 million dollar picture .
Remember that I mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips .
After treatment that &apos;s what it looks like .
This is happening today .
This is clinically relevant today .
But could you go a little further ?
This was done by Teruo Okano at Tokyo Women &apos;s Hospital .
He can actually grow beating tissue in a dish .
It &apos;s the coolest stuff .
Now I &apos;m going to show you cell-based regeneration .
But this one &apos;s kind of cool .
You see the cells coming back out .
This was a randomized trial .
These are now two years out .
There go the cells .
It &apos;s a great source of stem cells .
Stem cells are packed in that liposuction fluid .
So you could go in , you could get your tummy-tuck .
All done in the lab .
Here &apos;s just one example before I close up .
This is equally tragic .
Many of those patients are very severely burned .
And that bio-reactor will lay down in the wound bed .
The gun that you see there sprays cells .
That &apos;s going to spray cells over that area .
It &apos;s a completely different way of doing it .
So my 18 minutes is up .
The good news is that this is happening today .
It &apos;s very powerful work .
Clearly the images kind of get that across .
It &apos;s incredibly difficult because it &apos;s highly inter-disciplinary .
It &apos;s no coincidence .
They need this to work or their health system dies .
The European Union , same thing .
China , the same thing .
China just launched a national tissue-engineering center .
The first year budget was 250 million US dollars .
In the United States we &apos;ve had a somewhat different approach .
We &apos;ve had a different approach .
Thank you .
Terry Moore : Why is &apos; x &apos; the unknown ?
Where &apos;d that come from ?
This includes the little system in Arabic called al-jebra .
Al-jebr finally came into English as algebra .
One example among many .
But there were problems .
Trust me on that one .
Here &apos;s one of the culprits .
So this is al-shalan -- the unknown thing .
But now we have the answer to our question .
Why is it that X is the unknown ?
And I thought that was worth sharing .
Mike Biddle : We can recycle plastic
I &apos;m a garbage man .
And I &apos;d like to start at the very beginning .
Think back when you were just a kid .
How did look at the stuff in your life ?
The entire pile is my stuff if I &apos;m building something .
The more stuff that &apos;s mine , the better .
And let me tell you why I have that perspective .
We see above-ground mines .
In fact , it &apos;s more like five percent .
Most of it &apos;s incinerated or landfilled .
But actually , plastics are several times more valuable than steel .
They have very different densities .
They have different electrical and magnetic properties .
And they even have different colors .
Plastics have overlapping densities over a very narrow range .
They have either identical or very similar electrical and magnetic properties .
And they extract the metals by hand .
I call this environmental arbitrage .
This is just one example .
They store the plastics on the roofs .
Because after all , we &apos;re doing above-ground mining .
And we eventually broke the code .
This is the last frontier of recycling .
And we finally figured out how to do it .
The traditional way to make plastics is with oil or petrochemicals .
Well a good place to start is with waste .
We have significantly lower capital costs in our plant equipment .
We have enormous energy savings .
Our customers get to enjoy huge CO2 savings .
They get to close the loop with their products .
And they get to make more sustainable products .
Even an occasional dead animal , unfortunately .
It looks like the Willy Wonka factory at this point .
We then use optical sorting to color sort this material .
We blend it in 50,000-lb. blending silos .
And we chop those strands into what are called pellets .
And this becomes the currency of the plastics industry .
This is the same material that you would get from oil .
We took our clues from mother nature .
Mother nature wastes very little , reuses practically everything .
Thank you for your time .
Lalitesh Katragadda : Making maps to fight disaster , build economies
In 2008 , Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmar .
Millions of people were in severe need of help .
The U.N. wanted to rush people and supplies to the area .
But help was coming .
And it took them four days .
The new software they used ? Google Mapmaker .
Maps matter .
Welcome to the new world .
Nathan Myhrvold : Cooking as never seen before
I &apos;ve been interested in food for a long time .
I went to chef school in France .
And it &apos;s largely what you would find in these books .
And it &apos;s a wonderful thing .
But that &apos;s not in any of those books .
There &apos;s a chef in Spain named Ferran Adria .
He &apos;s developed a very avant-garde cuisine .
None of them are taught in cooking schools .
This is a picture called a cutaway .
This is actually the first picture I took in the book .
And the hope was two-fold .
Steaming ought to be faster .
So here &apos;s another one .
We discovered why woks are the shape they are .
And one of our canning cutaways .
Here &apos;s our hamburger cutaway .
Of course , you &apos;re not actually working the whole time .
Most of the time is kind of sitting there .
Buying mesquite charcoal will not actually make that much difference .
Mostly it comes from fat pyrolyzing , or burning .
Now you might wonder , how do we make these cutaways ?
Most people assume we use Photoshop .
We cut a $ 5,000 restaurant oven in half .
We used a red , very high-temperature silicon to do that .
In most cases , though , there was no glass .
Like for the hamburger , we just cut the damn barbecue .
The wok shot caught fire three times .
One of our cooks lost his eyebrows that way .
But hey , they grow back .
In addition to cutaways , we also explain physics .
This is Fourier &apos;s law of heat conduction .
It &apos;s a partial differential equation .
We &apos;ve got lots of little tidbits in the book .
Everybody knows that your various appliances have wattage , right ?
But you probably don &apos;t know that much about James Watt .
We also did a lot of calculation .
As you move side to side , it moves off .
That horn-shaped region is what we call the sweet spot .
So that &apos;s the place where you really want to cook .
Here &apos;s a step-by-step that shows grinding hamburger .
And it &apos;s really simple , as you can see here .
Here &apos;s the final hamburger .
This is the 30-hour hamburger .
We make every aspect of this burger .
The lettuce has got liquid smoke infused into it .
We also have things about how to make the bun .
The popcorn is illustrating a key thing in physics .
Isn &apos;t that beautiful ?
That &apos;s what &apos;s happening to the water inside that popcorn .
So it &apos;s a great illustration of that .
We have a chapter on gels .
Anyway , here &apos;s the book .
Here it is .
2,438 pages .
And they &apos;re nice big pages too .
Brian Greene : Is our universe the only universe ?
Now the idea of a multiverse is a strange one .
Now this was revolutionary .
What &apos;s pushing on it ?
And this explanation represents great progress .
But I promised you a mystery here in part one .
Here it is .
This number is small .
Expressed in the relevant unit , it is spectacularly small .
And the mystery is to explain this peculiar number .
Now you might wonder , should you care ?
First off , what is it ?
And the central idea of string theory is quite straightforward .
And in string theory , vibration determines everything .
So , what to do ?
Here &apos;s the idea .
Which means we have been asking the wrong question .
And that &apos;s a question on which we can make headway .
And that would be that .
Mystery solved , multiverse found .
Now some find this explanation unsatisfying .
Kepler was asking the wrong question .
And again , that &apos;s a question we can answer .
And that takes me to my final part , part three .
But there &apos;s a little secret .
The Big Bang leaves out something pretty important , the Bang .
Each of these universes has extra dimensions .
The extra dimensions take on a wide variety of different shapes .
The different shapes yield different physical features .
Well let me describe one way that might one day happen .
The inflationary theory already has strong observational support .
But would those future astronomers believe such ancient knowledge ?
I suspect the latter .
It appears that it may not always be that way .
and the message echoing across the ages is clear .
Thank you very much .
Brian , thank you .
Well it &apos;s hard to say .
Holy cow ! That &apos;s just amazing .
You &apos;re going to be around for the next few days .
Maybe some of these conversations can continue .
Thank you . Thank you , Brian .
Michael Tilson Thomas : Music and emotion through time
Yet , he was my greatest teacher .
But he was tough when it came to music .
That was his passion for the music .
Both my parents really loved it .
Brah dada dadadadah . &quot;
And he ran around the bases .
And I thought , go figure .
It &apos;s a language that &apos;s still evolving .
It &apos;s so simple , so evocative .
So many emotions seem to be inside of it .
It &apos;s just a design of pitches and silence and time .
They &apos;re locations in the spectrum of sound .
And in the 17th century , it was more like this .
And in the 21st century ...
Mozart was the same way .
This was truly the music of the spheres .
Singer : Ah , bitter blow !
Ah , wicked , cruel fate !
Ah , baleful stars !
Ah , avaricious heaven !
But what &apos;s the actual difference between these two chords ?
It &apos;s just these two notes in the middle .
So the big difference between human happiness and sadness ?
37 freakin &apos; vibrations .
Now with all this possibility , classical music really took off .
Now this moment so fascinates me .
I find it such a profound one .
What happens when the music stops ?
Where does it go ? What &apos;s left ?
And how might that change their lives ?
To me this is the intimate , personal side of music .
And to me that &apos;s the most essential of all .
And technology democratized music by making everything available .
Nobody knows .
The question remains : What happens when the music stops ?
What sticks with people ?
And the exciting thing is all this is just a prototype .
We need your perspectives , your curiosity , your voices .
You don &apos;t need to worry about knowing anything .
You can start anywhere . Ramble a bit .
Follow traces . Get lost . Be surprised , amused inspired .
Thank you .
Boghuma Kabisen Titanji : Ethical riddles in HIV research
Maybe this particular trial yielded exciting results .
Maybe it even got published in a high-profile scientific journal .
The first of these is informed consent .
Thank you .
Jared Diamond : How societies can grow old better
I &apos;m going to talk about growing older in traditional societies .
In which tribal societies do children abandon or kill their parents ?
It happens mainly under two conditions .
They face a cruel situation of no choice .
In those societies , older people are cared for .
They are fed . They remain valuable .
Older Americans are at a big disadvantage in job applications .
They &apos;re at a big disadvantage in hospitals .
We Americans move on the average every five years .
That &apos;s a huge problem .
They &apos;ve already gained experience from raising their own children .
Unfortunately , all of those terrible situations could come back .
Older people have that experience .
Younger people don &apos;t .
Some abilities , of course , decrease with age .
They think more realistically about dangers than we do .
Thank you .
Jae Rhim Lee : My mushroom burial suit
And it &apos;s everywhere .
But it &apos;s just one chemical .
The Center for Disease Control in the U.S.
To me , this says three things .
First , don &apos;t become a cannibal .
So what happens to all these toxins when we die ?
But our current funeral practices make the situation much worse .
I think there &apos;s a better solution .
Just a little .
And now about these ninja pajamas .
I &apos;m wearing the second prototype of this burial suit .
I believe this is the beginning of true environmental responsibility .
Thank you .
Jonathan Klein : Photos that changed the world
Okay , we &apos;re naive , we &apos;re bright-eyed and bushy-tailed .
So let &apos;s begin with a group of images .
But I think we &apos;re looking for something more .
We &apos;re looking for something more .
Well , this image you &apos;ve all seen .
It changed our view of the physical world .
We had never seen our planet from this perspective before .
This destructive power takes many different forms .
There &apos;s another kind of crucifixion .
Let &apos;s go back a little .
In fact , these images became the voices of protest themselves .
Did the images change the world ?
No , but they had a major impact .
John Moore set up this photo at Arlington Cemetery .
My company has 70 million images .
I have one image in my office .
Here it is .
And thank you to all the photographers .
John Hunter : Teaching with the World Peace Game
I &apos;m very fortunate to be here .
I feel so fortunate .
I &apos;ve been so impressed by the kindness expressed to me .
It &apos;s a true feeling .
And she &apos;s a very high-tech superintendent .
She &apos;s a technology leader and instructional leader .
Why is this old table in your office ? &quot;
It all started back in 1977 .
It was an experimental education program .
Gifted education hadn &apos;t really taken hold too much .
There weren &apos;t really many materials or things to use .
And I said , &quot; What do I do ? &quot;
And her answer shocked me . It stunned me .
She said , &quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And that question cleared the space .
His name is Chris Farina .
Chris Farina is here today at his own cost .
But the film has really gone places .
And it &apos;s a beautiful thing .
What I saw was my teachers coming through me .
That &apos;s the smile I use -- that &apos;s his smile .
I saw Jan Polo &apos;s flashing eyes .
And I have that kind of flash sometimes .
And you know , she had that old-school teacher stare .
You know the one .
You know that teacher ?
And Miss Banks was there as a great mentor for me .
And then I saw my own parents , my first teachers .
My father , very inventive , spatial thinker .
That &apos;s my brother Malcolm there on the right .
I am one of her teaching gestures .
It &apos;s an amazing feeling to have that lineage .
I &apos;m not here alone .
There are many people on this stage right now .
I was creating a lesson for students on Africa .
I didn &apos;t want to lecture or have just book reading .
So I thought , well they like to play games .
And it has four Plexiglass layers .
There are four countries around the board .
They have different assets , commercial and military .
And each country has a cabinet .
I choose the Prime Minister based on my relationship with them .
That &apos;s not all .
So that , if one thing changes , everything else changes .
And they &apos;ve done it several times too .
But they &apos;re also trying to undermine everything in the game .
I &apos;m just a clock watcher .
I &apos;m just a clarifier . I &apos;m just a facilitator .
The students run the game .
So I &apos;ll just share with you ...
Boy : The World Peace Game is serious .
And so I apologize to them as well .
Now you may be wondering what all this complexity looks like .
It &apos;s a serious question : who is really in charge ?
To her girlfriends she said that .
That &apos;s a breach there .
They are the toughest opponents .
And we were very upset .
I could not have designed that in teaching it .
It came about spontaneously through their collective wisdom .
Another example , a beautiful thing happened .
We have a letter in the game .
&quot; Let &apos;s ask that mom to read the letter .
It &apos;ll be more realer if she reads it . &quot;
She read two sentences .
By the third sentence , she was in tears .
I was in tears .
We all lose .
And it was an amazing occurrence and an amazing understanding .
I &apos;ll show you what my friend David says about this .
He &apos;s been in many battles .
David : We &apos;ve really had enough of people attacking .
JH : I get chills every time I see that .
That &apos;s the kind of engagement you want to have happen .
But it &apos;s self-evident assessment .
We know that &apos;s an authentic assessment of learning .
So I &apos;ll just share a third story .
This is about my friend Brennan .
Some are poor , some are wealthy . There are billions .
The World Bank president was a third-grader one time .
So the team that was the poorest had gotten even poorer .
There was no way they could win .
I thought , I &apos;m failing as a teacher .
I should have gotten it so they could have won .
They shouldn &apos;t be failing like this .
I &apos;ve failed them .
And I was just feeling so sad and dejected .
They get these dossiers full of secret documents .
They were gesticulating ; they were running around .
Principal walks in , I &apos;m out of a job .
The parents were looking in the window .
And we &apos;ve got 600 billion dollars .
Will you accept it ? &quot;
And there are three seconds left on the clock .
And the game is won .
Every game we play is different .
Some games are more about warfare .
If only .
Nic Marks : The Happy Planet Index
He said , &quot; I have a dream . &quot;
And I have a dream .
We have focused on the worst-case scenario .
We have focused on the problems .
And we have not thought enough about the solutions .
People are freezing and running away because we &apos;re using fear .
What would it be like to be improving the human lot ?
Come on . In the Western world , we have enough .
This is from a global survey .
It &apos;s asking people , what do they want .
Okay , they think money is slightly important .
We all need to love and be loved in life .
It &apos;s not nearly as important as health .
We want to be healthy and live a full life .
These seem to be natural human aspirations .
Why are statisticians not measuring these ?
That should be the goal of every nation on the planet .
And economics is very interested in scarcity .
It is an efficiency measure .
More is bad .
It &apos;s about the well-being of nations .
It &apos;s like a happiness adjusted life-expectancy .
It &apos;s like quality and quantity of life in nations .
In Hobbesian terms , life is short and brutish there .
But now for the good news !
This is an aspirational graph .
They &apos;re Latin American .
Maybe some of you have .
Costa Rica .
Costa Rica -- average life expectancy is 78-and-a-half years .
That is longer than in the USA .
They are the happiest place .
What &apos;s going on there ?
What &apos;s happening in Costa Rica ?
We can look at some of the data .
99 percent of their electricity comes from renewable resources .
They abolished the army in 1949 -- 1949 .
And they invested in social programs -- health and education .
And they have that Latin vibe , don &apos;t they .
They have the social connectedness .
It might be Latin American .
That &apos;s what we need to do .
And then we &apos;re starting to create a happy planet .
That &apos;s one way of looking at it .
Another way of looking at it is looking at time trends .
It &apos;s actually not very long away .
It &apos;s half a human lifetime away .
A child entering school today will be my age in 2050 .
This is not the very distant future .
That is changing our business .
I think we want it to carry on .
They want to hold on to what they &apos;ve got .
And that means we have to really increase efficiency even more .
Human beings are very motivated by the &quot; now . &quot;
What would that look like for society ?
And why do I hear that ?
That &apos;s how you create a collective goal .
At a personal level , we need these nudges too .
What are these for happiness ?
Keep building them .
The second one is be active .
Being active is great for our positive mood .
The third one is take notice .
It &apos;s more curiosity .
Keep learning .
We feel good if we give .
They don &apos;t have any carbon content .
Human beings want to be happy .
Pave them with the five ways .
Shirin Neshat : Art in exile
Well , it has its pluses and minuses .
Politics have defined our lives .
We are there to take pride and insist on respect .
And at the same time , we &apos;re fighting another battle .
Our artists are at risk .
We are in a position of danger .
We pose a threat to the order of the government .
Art is our weapon .
Culture is a form of resistance .
I did not start to make social commentary about my country .
It was after the Islamic Revolution of 1979 .
For me , this became incredibly important .
And yet , I had an unusual position toward this .
So my art became slightly more critical .
My knife became a little sharper .
And I fell into a life in exile .
I am a nomadic artist .
I work in Morocco , in Turkey , in Mexico .
I go everywhere to make believe it &apos;s Iran .
Now I am making films .
The book is written by an Iranian woman , Shahrnush Parsipur .
It &apos;s a magical realist novel .
These are some of the shots actually from my film .
These are some of the images of the coup .
The challenge I have is how to do that .
How to tell a political story but an allegorical story .
The green movement significantly inspired the world .
They &apos;re absolutely inspirational for me .
That , under all circumstances , they have pushed the boundary .
They have confronted the authority .
And once again , they proved themselves .
Thank you so much .
Beau Lotto : Optical illusions show how we see
I want to start with a game .
So , we have two panels here , of colored dots .
And you have to tell me which one .
Really ? Okay .
How many people think it &apos;s the green one ?
And how many people think it &apos;s the orange one ?
Pretty even split .
Let &apos;s find out what the reality is .
Here is the orange one .
Here is the green one .
And here is the gray one .
And instead of telling you , I &apos;ll just show you .
Can anyone see it ? Anyone ? No ?
And now you see it .
And these are two projections from the world .
They are identical in every single way .
Identical in shape , size , spectral content .
And yet they come from completely different sources .
And yet it &apos;s only the retinal information that we get .
So how on Earth do we even see ?
There is no inherent meaning in information .
It &apos;s what we do with that information that matters .
Audience : &quot; Can you read this ? &quot;
&quot; You are not reading this . &quot;
&quot; What are you reading ? &quot;
But you put one there . Why ?
So you don &apos;t do it again .
So , if I could have the lights down up here .
One is simply the flipping of the other . Okay ?
But I really want you to learn .
That &apos;s what it &apos;s learning . Okay ?
So why don &apos;t you do that now ?
Can I have the lights up again ?
That &apos;s your new normal .
So , what does this mean for context ?
And the same thing over on the right .
And see what happens to your perception .
So you see it that way .
So you see it that way .
This is one I made a few years ago .
The four blue tiles on the left are gray .
The seven yellow tiles on the right are also gray .
They are the same . Okay ?
Don &apos;t believe me ? Let &apos;s watch it again .
Now I want you to keep looking at it .
Move your eyes around , blink , maybe close one eye .
Yes ? Raise your hand if you got that . Yes ?
So I can ask you , which direction is it rotating ?
How do you know ?
Your brain doesn &apos;t know . Because both are equally likely .
Are we the only ones that see illusions ?
The answer to this question is no .
So in my lab , we of course work on bumblebees .
And we do this in what we call the Bee Matrix .
And you &apos;ll see one of the bees come out here .
You see how she has a little number on her ?
Now , they are not born that way . Right ?
And then you can superglue little numbers on them .
And here she comes down the ladder .
But what are these bees doing in the upper right corner ?
It looks like they &apos;re going to green flowers .
Now , are they getting it wrong ?
But those are blue flowers under green light .
Okay , this is complete rubbish .
And how we see is by continually redefining normality .
And they can navigate the world using their ears .
On the left is what his camera sees .
That line is broken up into 32 squares .
In each square we calculate the average color .
And then we just simply translate that into sound .
He finds it . Amazing . Right ?
And then we translated these images .
And this is one of those images .
And this is what it sounds like .
So , a six-year-old child . Okay ?
Now , what does all this mean ?
And that ecology is necessarily relative , historical and empirical .
Because I think only through uncertainty is there potential for understanding .
So , if we have the lights down .
I &apos;m going to do this opposite on the left here .
Agreed ? Yes ?
Okay . So they are physically the same .
Let &apos;s pull the covers off .
Do they look the same ? No .
The question is , &quot; Is that an illusion ? &quot;
And I &apos;ll leave you with that .
So , thank you very much .
David Pogue : The music wars
A TED medley -- a TEDley .
Martin Seligman : The new era of positive psychology
And she said , &quot; Well , one . &quot;
&quot; Good . &quot;
&quot; Cut . Cut . That won &apos;t do .
We &apos;d really better give you a longer sound bite . &quot;
Doctor Seligman , what is the state of psychology today ? &quot;
&quot; Not good . &quot;
We &apos;d better give you a real sound bite .
This time you can have three words .
Professor Seligman , what is the state of psychology today ? &quot;
So , why was psychology good ?
That we could create a classification of the mental illnesses .
That we could understand the causality of the mental illnesses .
And we forgot that people made choices and decisions .
We forgot responsibility . That was the first cost .
The second cost was that we forgot about you people .
We forgot about improving normal lives .
No one works on that .
So that was not good .
It should be interested in the best things in life .
It turns out that we can measure different forms of happiness .
And how do they differ from the rest of us ?
And it turns out there &apos;s one way .
They don &apos;t sit in seminars on Saturday morning .
They don &apos;t spend time alone .
About 120 interventions have been proposed that allegedly make people happy .
That is , which ones actually make people lastingly happier ?
The first happy life is the pleasant life .
That &apos;s what Aristotle was talking about .
And third , the meaningful life .
And , as I said , it &apos;s not particularly malleable .
And this leads to the second life .
Len is an introvert .
But it turned out there wasn &apos;t any sexual trauma .
You &apos;re one with the music . Time stops .
You have intense concentration .
Hated the job .
She &apos;s working her way through college .
Now obviously she failed .
What you get out of that is not smiley-ness .
You don &apos;t look like Debbie Reynolds .
The second path is eudaimonian flow .
And the third path is meaning .
This is the most venerable of the happinesses , traditionally .
It &apos;s being done in a rigorous manner .
Close your eyes .
The person has to be alive . OK .
Now , OK , you can open your eyes .
I hope all of you have such a person .
And fun versus philanthropy .
So those are examples of positive interventions .
The pursuit of meaning is the strongest .
The pursuit of engagement is also very strong .
But they were empty .
AnnMarie Thomas : Hands-on science with squishy circuits
I &apos;m a huge believer in hands-on education .
But you have to have the right tools .
And so we spent a summer looking at different Play-Doh recipes .
You see that really salty Play-Doh ?
Well , it conducts electricity .
And this is nothing new .
And that sugar dough ?
So what does that mean ?
And so I want to do a little demo for you .
If I push these together , the light turns off .
If I separate them again , I have some light .
It &apos;s like a wall to the electricity .
I plug in again the power to it .
And now I can start talking about parallel and series circuits .
I can start plugging in lots of lights .
And we can start talking about things like electrical load .
It &apos;ll dim .
You could do parallel and series circuits for kids using this .
So this is all in your home kitchen .
We &apos;ve got some videos . You can make them yourselves .
Have fun . Thank you .
Billy Graham : On technology and faith
And I was so stimulated .
Richard can answer that , because he made that decision .
I was to address a conference at a hotel .
And the man said , &quot; No , who ? &quot;
He said , &quot; You don &apos;t say ! &quot;
He said , &quot; Your sermons have certainly helped me . &quot;
And I suppose that that &apos;s true with thousands of people .
We &apos;ve had others .
And there &apos;s one that I want to talk about .
He was a man of tremendous leadership .
He had the favor of God with him .
There were many problems still left .
The first one that David saw was human evil .
Where does it come from ?
How do we solve it ?
And yet he says , &quot; He restores my soul . &quot;
Have you ever thought about what a contradiction we are ?
But on the other hand , something is wrong .
Now , what causes this ?
And revolutions ?
But he made this statement .
The Oklahoma City bombing was simple technology , horribly used .
The problem is not technology .
The problem is the person or persons using it .
We are a soul .
What &apos;s life all about ? Why am I here ?
I went to Ambassador Dobrynin , whom I knew very well .
What shall I talk to her about ? &quot;
And he surprised me with the answer .
He said , &quot; Talk to her about religion and philosophy .
That &apos;s what she &apos;s really interested in . &quot;
I haven &apos;t given a talk in nearly four months .
I &apos;m not reading . I never read an address .
I never read a speech or a talk or a lecture .
I talk ad lib .
We have families that self-destruct , friends that betray us .
Unbearable psychological pressures bear down on us .
He said , &quot; The Lord is my shepherd . &quot;
Most people live as if they &apos;re never going to die .
Technology projects the myth of control over our mortality .
We see people on our screens .
They don &apos;t know that she &apos;s dead .
Or Clark Gable , or whoever it is .
The old stars , they come to life .
But death is inevitable .
And we were meeting in that room , the statue room .
About 300 of them were there .
I said , &quot; We &apos;re all going to die .
And it &apos;s often difficult for young people to understand that .
I &apos;ve talked to them .
Was there a God ?
It passes so fast . &quot;
But it does not need to have to be that way .
On the contrary , they &apos;re sisters . &quot;
He put it on a personal basis .
I knew Dr. von Braun very well .
And I said , &quot; Sir , I do . &quot;
He said , &quot; So do I. &quot;
Blaise Pascal asked exactly that question in seventeenth-century France .
Pascal has been called the architect of modern civilization .
Pascal saw us as a remarkable mixture of genius and self-delusion .
Equally well known is Pascal &apos;s Wager .
For Pascal , scientific knowledge paled beside the knowledge of God .
I didn &apos;t make good grades in high school .
One day , I was faced face-to-face with Christ .
Can you imagine that ? &quot; I am the truth .
I &apos;m the embodiment of all truth . &quot;
He was a liar .
Or he was insane .
Or he was what he claimed to be .
Which was he ?
I had to make that decision .
I couldn &apos;t prove it .
Thank you , and God bless all of you .
Thank you for the privilege . It was great .
Richard Wurman : You did it .
Thanks .
Patricia Ryan : Don &apos;t insist on English !
I know what you &apos;re thinking .
I get that all the time in Dubai .
&quot; Here on holiday are you , dear ? &quot;
&quot; Come to visit the children ?
How long are you staying ? &quot;
Well actually , I hope for a while longer yet .
Now that statistic is quite shocking .
How did those students get all that knowledge ?
Of course , from their grandparents and even their great-grandparents .
A language dies every 14 days .
Could there be a connection ?
Well I don &apos;t know .
Actually , not that long ago .
That is a little bit too early .
Okay .
And why not ?
So everybody wants to have an English education , naturally .
Perhaps you have a computer scientist who &apos;s a genius .
Well , I don &apos;t think so .
We English teachers reject them all the time .
I don &apos;t think so .
But indeed , that is exactly what we do .
We English teachers are the gatekeepers .
Maybe the barrier would be too universal .
Okay .
It &apos;s all in English . &quot;
It feeds the English requirement .
And so it goes on .
I ask you , what happened to translation ?
And so light shone upon the Dark Ages of Europe .
I love it that we have a global language .
We need one today more than ever .
But I am against using it as a barrier .
Case in point , Einstein .
Now it &apos;s exploded .
There are lots and lots of tests of English .
And millions and millions of students take these tests every year .
So immediately , we &apos;re rejecting them .
They want to give their children the best chance in life .
And to do that , they need a Western education .
It &apos;s a circular thing .
Okay .
But they couldn &apos;t get the results they wanted .
So bingo , problem solved .
If you can &apos;t think a thought , you are stuck .
My daughter came to England from Kuwait .
She had studied science and mathematics in Arabic .
It &apos;s an Arabic medium school .
She had to translate it into English at her grammar school .
And she was the best in the class at those subjects .
So he invented a cost-free solar lamp .
A simple idea , but it could have such far-reaching consequences .
Let us not keep them and ourselves in the dark .
Let us celebrate diversity .
Mind your language .
Use it to spread great ideas .
Thank you very much .
Alex Steffen : The shareable future of cities
That shouldn &apos;t be news to any of us .
We will be an overwhelmingly urban species .
And people are embracing this .
Some of it &apos;s transportation access .
This is Google Walking Maps .
Okay . I do too .
Buildings are becoming bundles of services .
So we light our buildings with daylight .
We cool them with breezes . We heat them with sunshine .
These things actually become cheaper to build than the alternatives .
This is one way to do it .
So we have visions like this .
We have visions like this . We have visions like this .
Water is energy intensive .
Thank you very much .
Angela Patton : A father-daughter dance ... in prison
My daddy , he calls me all the time . &quot;
&quot; I haven &apos;t heard from my dad in years . &quot;
The wisdom lives inside of them .
They were dressed to the nines .
They acted sweet .
They acted silly .
They really enjoyed each other &apos;s company .
It was a huge success .
And the girls decided to make it an annual event .
&quot; Why not ? &quot; the girls asked .
&quot; Because he &apos;s in jail , &quot; she bravely admitted .
&quot; And come in shackles ?
That &apos;s worse than not having him here at all . &quot;
We want every girl to experience the dance , right ? &quot;
Because that &apos;s what they called them .
So , 16 inmates and 18 girls were invited .
They hugged .
They shared a full catered meal of chicken and fish .
They laughed together .
It was beautiful .
Even the guards cried .
I have had my father in my life always .
He &apos;s even here today .
Dennis vanEngelsdorp : A plea for bees
Now , that &apos;s an awful lot of bees .
And most of those losses are because of things we know .
And this flu has wiped through the population of bees .
But we think this virus is pretty ubiquitous .
We think perhaps it &apos;s a combination of factors .
No formal education , but very knowledgeable .
And these migratory beekeepers are the last nomads of America .
And although I highly encourage you , all use honey .
And bees are very faithful .
And of course , they &apos;re made to carry this pollen .
However , honeybees are a minority .
We have identified over 400 species of bees in Pennsylvania .
We have bumblebees on the top .
They &apos;re like tiny little flies and they fly around .
Dennis vanEngelsdorp : Bee . Okay , thanks .
And bats are dying at an extraordinary rate .
White-nose syndrome has wiped out populations of bats .
And I think that there is an easy cure for NDD .
And that is , make meadows and not lawns .
And so we need to rethink this idea .
And I encourage you to look at that .
Danielle de Niese : A flirtatious aria
Eve Ensler : Embrace your inner girl
Namaste . Good morning .
I &apos;m very happy to be here in India .
And I want to call it the girl cell .
And it &apos;s in men as well as in women .
To be a boy really means not to be a girl .
To be a man means not to be a girl .
To be a woman means not to be a girl .
To be strong means not to be a girl .
To be a leader means not to be a girl .
For me , it was the turning point of my life .
His name is Dr. Denis Mukwege .
My mind was so shattered .
Because my crying somehow exposed his brutality to him .
I know that we have systematically annihilated the girl cell .
And I will tell you a very funny story .
I &apos;ve seen girls be treated like garbage cans .
The selling of girls is rampant across the planet .
Girls are trained to please .
I want to change the verb .
I want us all to change the verb .
And she was holding her baby .
And I asked her if she loved her baby .
It &apos;s my baby and it &apos;s full of love . &quot;
They kidnapped her , they put her in a car .
So , for years Agnes walked through the Rift valley .
She has literally become deputy mayor .
She &apos;s changed the rules .
The whole community has bought in to what she &apos;s doing .
And there was a young girl named Jaclyn .
And she knew that meant she would be cut .
She knew that meant she wouldn &apos;t go to school .
She knew that meant she wouldn &apos;t have a future .
She slept with the hyenas . She hid at night .
And when she got to the house she was greeted .
We will not cut you .
For me , that is the power of girls .
And that is the power of transformation .
And I want to do it for Sunitha .
This is called &quot; I &apos;m An Emotional Creature . &quot;
And it happened because I met a girl in Watts , L.A.
It &apos;s all bad . My brothers get everything . &quot;
I &apos;m an emotional creature ! &quot;
This is for her : I love being a girl .
I am an emotional creature .
I know when a storm is coming .
I can feel the invisible stirrings in the air .
I am an emotional creature .
I love that I do not take things lightly .
I am an emotional creature .
These feelings make me better .
I am an emotional creature .
There is a particular way of knowing .
It &apos;s like the older women somehow forgot .
I rejoice that it &apos;s still in my body .
Oh , I know when the coconut &apos;s about to fall .
I know we have pushed the Earth too far .
And you know what ? Sometimes it should .
I am an emotional creature .
You don &apos;t tell the Atlantic Ocean to behave .
I am an emotional creature .
I am your remaining memory .
I can take you back .
Nothing &apos;s been diluted .
Nothing &apos;s leaked out .
Can you say it with me ?
Thank you very much .
Rives : The 4 a.m. mystery
This is a recent comic strip from the Los Angeles Times .
The punch line ?
This is a recent cover of New York Magazine .
A time for inconveniences , mishaps , yearnings .
It is four in the morning . &quot;
They worked until four o &apos;clock in the morning .
And it made me suspicious .
Could it be there is something more going on here ?
I call this The Giacometti Code , a TED exclusive .
Results vary , of course . This is pretty typical .
But he didn &apos;t die on Dench &apos;s birthday .
Where was Wislawa Szymborska during all this ?
She has the world &apos;s most absolutely watertight alibi .
Coincidence ? No , it &apos;s creepy .
Coincidence to me has a much simpler metric .
Now do you need towels , laundry , maids ?
It is Christmas Day , 4 a.m.
There &apos;s a rumble in my stomach .
Marge Simpson : Homer , please .
Let me see if I got this straight , Matt .
Parse it cover to cover for whatever hidden references you want .
Would you believe about a dozen paragraphs ?
It had gotten a lot better since 4 a.m. &quot;
Well , how could it have ?
What happens to American presidents at 0400 on inauguration day ?
What happened to William Jefferson Clinton ?
We might not ever know .
It could get awkward , right ?
In generations .
George Dyson : The birth of the computer
This was a perfect introduction .
And it was a technology that was inevitable .
He said you needed addition and subtraction .
You could do the whole thing with addition .
And that &apos;s really the simplest computer .
That &apos;s where I grew up as a kid .
All these forces came together there , in Princeton .
Oppenheimer , who had built the bomb .
The machine was actually used mainly for doing bomb calculations .
These were the prototype geeks , the nerds .
They didn &apos;t fit in at the Institute .
You can read the text .
This is hackers getting in trouble for the first time .
These were not theoretical physicists .
And it really was . It was the original microprocessor .
All the computers now are copies of that machine .
The input and the output was by teletype tape at first .
This is a wire drive , using bicycle wheels .
Then they switched to a magnetic drum .
And this is the beginning of computer graphics .
This includes a large amount of human error .
What &apos;s code , what &apos;s hardware ?
He had to focus the memory -- seems OK .
&quot; No use , went home . &quot;
Burning lots of midnight oil .
&quot; Found trouble in code , I hope . &quot;
&quot; Code error , machine not guilty . &quot;
&quot; A short -- do not turn the machine on . &quot;
So they really were working under tough conditions .
The high speed was 16 kilocycles .
&quot; I have now duplicated both results .
This now is the third different output .
I know when I &apos;m licked . &quot;
&quot; We &apos;ve duplicated errors before . &quot;
&quot; Machine run , fine . Code isn &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; Only happens when the machine is running . &quot;
And sometimes things are okay .
Trying to start an artificial genetic system running in the computer .
Began -- his universe started March 3 , &apos; 53 .
He had a wonderful rapport .
Even errors were duplicated .
So he designed this universe , and ran it .
It was published in the literature .
This is some of the generations of his universe .
They have to have something .
You have a genotype and you have to have a phenotype .
And they did start to evolve .
And he went around the country after that .
And he saw that evolution itself was an intelligent process .
It just was another version of the same thing happening .
And could you do it again now ?
And it was his universe on punch cards .
And the question is , should we run them or not ?
You know , could we get them running ?
Do you want to let it loose on the Internet ?
And that &apos;s what &apos;s happening !
It &apos;s a world that Von Neumann himself envisioned .
And we owe a tremendous credit to that .
And that &apos;s the end .
Thank you very much .
Don Norman : 3 ways good design makes you happy
The new me is beauty .
Well , I didn &apos;t have that in mind , so ...
This is neat .
Thank you for setting up my display .
I mean , it &apos;s just wonderful .
And that &apos;s my new life .
The acid will ruin the gold plating .
Beneath it is a wonderful knife .
It &apos;s a Global cutting knife made in Japan .
It &apos;s a delight to use .
And so it &apos;s got everything , right ?
It &apos;s beautiful and it &apos;s functional .
And those are the three components .
Is that a good way to play ping-pong ?
No . But is it fun ?
Yeah ! Yeah .
Or look at Google .
So Google just took their logo and they spread it out .
Instead of saying , &quot; You got 73,000 results .
It &apos;s really simple and subtle .
And it &apos;s just clever .
So , OK .
It was third .
Oh well , different story .
Buy it anyway .
It &apos;s so much fun to drive . &quot;
It &apos;s round , it &apos;s neat .
The controls work wonderfully .
I &apos;m going to put a plank on the ground .
No problem .
Intense fear paralyzes you .
It actually affects the way the brain works .
And I couldn &apos;t force myself across that .
Now some people can -- circus workers , steel workers .
But it really changes the way you think .
She brought students in to solve problems .
Would you tie those two strings together ? &quot;
Still can &apos;t reach it .
And , basically , none of them could solve it .
Would you like the box of candy ? &quot;
And guess what -- they solved the problem .
That &apos;s what brainstorming is about , right ?
You &apos;ve got be anxious .
No big deal .
Biology -- we have co-adapted through biology to like bright colors .
So that &apos;s the visceral level .
It &apos;s all about the visceral experience .
Visceral is subconscious , you &apos;re unaware of it .
Behavioral is subconscious , you &apos;re unaware of it .
Almost everything we do is subconscious .
Most of what we do is subconscious .
That &apos;s why the Global knives are so neat .
Or the sensual feeling .
It &apos;s a Ronnefeldt tilting teapot .
The water then seeps over the tea .
Emotion is all about acting ; emotion is really about acting .
It &apos;s being safe in the world .
It &apos;s kind of neat . What a wonderful design .
It looks over what &apos;s going on .
Here &apos;s a great reflective product .
But that &apos;s reflective design as well .
But it &apos;s ugly .
This is a clear Don Norman watch .
So , it &apos;s pitting one against the other .
The other neat thing ...
And that &apos;s what &apos;s nice about emotion .
So that &apos;s the new me .
I &apos;m only saying positive things from now on .
Renny Gleeson : Our antisocial phone tricks
So we &apos;ve developed certain tactics and strategies to cover up .
This first one &apos;s called &quot; the lean . &quot;
&quot; The stretch . &quot;
to get that device just below the tabletop .
Or , this one , coming to us from India .
That is actually the device .
Look around you .
This one I love .
This is the sound of one hand clapping .
People aren &apos;t simply projecting identity , they &apos;re creating it .
Thank you .
And then I &apos;ll draw the connection between these two behaviors .
Many of you have probably already noticed that I &apos;m Chinese .
I grew up in the Midwest of the United States .
You understood exactly what I just said in English .
I wouldn &apos;t have been able to convey so little information .
Actually , no .
It is the only Germanic language that requires this .
You speak English , a futured language .
Now this is a fanciful theory .
But how would you actually go about testing such a theory ?
This is a pocket of futureless language speakers in Northern Europe .
What is the average difference here ?
Five percentage points of your GDP saved per year .
Let me show you how far you can do that .
The survey takes over a day .
What are the characteristics we can control for ?
Does this have cumulative effects ?
Can we push this data even further ?
Well , think about smoking , for example .
Smoking is in some deep sense negative savings .
It &apos;s current pleasure in exchange for future pain .
What we should expect then is the opposite effect .
And that &apos;s exactly what we find .
Thank you very much .
Ken Robinson : Bring on the learning revolution !
Well , it &apos;s been downloaded four million times .
... don &apos;t you feel ?
And I referenced that at the end of my last talk .
So , as I was saying ...
You see , he &apos;s right .
Well , I do .
They simply go through their lives getting on with it .
They get no great pleasure from what they do .
And it &apos;s not true of enough people .
it &apos;s still true of a minority of people .
I think there are many possible explanations for it .
You have to create the circumstances where they show themselves .
This has to be transformed into something else .
One of the real challenges is to innovate fundamentally in education .
We don &apos;t teach American history in Britain .
We suppress it . You know , this is our policy .
I love that .
Not rise to it , rise with it .
I love that word , &quot; disenthrall . &quot;
You know what it means ?
Now , doing this is easier said than done .
And the reason is that you take it for granted .
So let me ask you something you may take for granted .
How many of you here are over the age of 25 ?
Are there any people here under the age of 25 ?
Ask a room full of teenagers the same thing .
Teenagers do not wear wristwatches .
They see no reason to do this .
She doesn &apos;t see the point .
&quot; Like , how lame is that ? &quot;
&quot; It has multiple functions . &quot;
Let me give you a couple of examples .
And probably the pinnacle for education is getting you to college .
I think we are obsessed with getting people to college .
Certain sorts of college .
Maybe they go later , not right away .
And I said , &quot; What do you do ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; I &apos;m a fireman . &quot;
This one teacher didn &apos;t take it seriously .
This linearity thing is a problem .
When I arrived in L.A.
No , it doesn &apos;t .
It doesn &apos;t .
Kindergarten begins in kindergarten .
They &apos;re three .
&quot; You &apos;ve achieved nothing -- commit .
The other big issue is conformity .
This is something Jamie Oliver talked about the other day .
You know there are two models of quality assurance in catering .
One is fast food , where everything is standardized .
I think we have to recognize a couple of things here .
One is that human talent is tremendously diverse .
People have very different aptitudes .
In a way , it did not for me .
It just wouldn &apos;t work .
But it &apos;s not only about that .
It &apos;s about passion .
So I think we have to change metaphors .
And you cannot predict the outcome of human development .
There are many great models .
That &apos;s where children experience life .
And I wanted to just very quickly ...
And we should tread softly .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Elizabeth Murchison : Fighting a contagious cancer
So first of all , what is a Tasmanian devil ?
A marsupial is a mammal with a pouch like a kangaroo .
At the time , this was thought to be a one-off .
Animals , just like humans , sometimes get strange tumors .
She hadn &apos;t eaten for days .
Her guts were swimming with parasitic worms .
Her body was riddled with secondary tumors .
Of course , they died along with the mother .
They were too young to survive without their mother .
Natural selection is survival of the fittest .
That &apos;s why cancer is such a difficult disease to treat .
It evolves .
The next slide is going to be gruesome .
This is Jonas .
I took these back to the lab .
I extracted DNA from them .
We found that all of these cancers shared the same DNA .
Think about that for a minute .
But how can a cancer spread in a population ?
So this Tasmanian devil cancer is perhaps the ultimate cancer .
Well the answer is , it has .
This is Kimbo .
And if you &apos;re squeamish , please look away now .
We also believe this cancer might be very old .
This cancer is remarkable .
It &apos;s the oldest mammalian-derived life form that we know of .
It &apos;s a living relic of the distant past .
So we &apos;ve seen that this can happen in animals .
Could cancers be contagious between people ?
What this tells us , ethical issues aside , is that ...
However , under some circumstances , it can happen .
My personal aim is to defeat the Tasmanian devil cancer .
Thank you .
Derek Paravicini and Adam Ockelford : In the key of genius
Music must be the thing for Derek .
That was the great eureka moment .
Derek Paravicini : I taught myself to play .
DP : &quot; Molly Malone . &quot;
AO : It wasn &apos;t actually &quot; Cockles and Mussels . &quot;
This one is &quot; English Country Garden . &quot;
DP : &quot; English Country Garden . &quot;
AO : There you are .
I think that &apos;s just fantastic .
Basically it was just an exciting journey , really .
But Derek , your ear is so much more than that .
Well , forget the terminology , Derek . Fantastic .
Now then .
So for example using your thumb under with C major .
Etc .
DP : No .
DP : This .
AO : Derek , let &apos;s have a bow .
Well done .
DP : &quot; Flight of the Bumblebee &quot; on that note .
AO : Or another one ? How about in G minor ?
DP : G minor .
AO : Fantastic . Well done , Derek .
Fantastic chap .
The other wonderful thing about you is memory .
So just be thoughtful before you suggest something too outlandish .
But seriously , would anyone like to choose a piece ?
Would you like to hear me play ?
AO : Well done .
DP : &quot; Chopsticks . &quot;
He &apos;s sitting there .
DP : Let Derek play it .
AO : What did you do with it , Derek ?
DP : I got to improvise with it , Adam .
AO : This is Derek the musician .
Keep up with Derek .
So this is one of Derek &apos;s heroes .
It &apos;s the great Art Tatum -- DP : Art Tatum .
DP : &quot; Tiger Rag . &quot;
Bjorn Lomborg : Global priorities bigger than climate change
So get out your pen and paper .
I &apos;m just going to list some of them .
There are 800 million people starving .
There &apos;s a billion people without clean drinking water .
Two billion people without sanitation .
There are several million people dying of HIV and AIDS .
The lists go on and on .
There are many , many problems out there .
We don &apos;t actually solve all problems .
And that &apos;s the question I &apos;d like to ask you .
Where should we start on solving these problems ?
But that &apos;s a wrong problem to ask .
Because we can &apos;t solve problems .
To climate change that would be like Kyoto .
What should be at the bottom of the list ?
And one reason is that prioritization is incredibly uncomfortable .
Nobody wants to do this .
We have not had an idea .
We &apos;d like to know these things .
Likewise in communicable diseases .
What would be the price ?
And so on .
We called them the &quot; dream team . &quot;
And then you ask , why economists ?
That is what economists do .
They prioritize .
These were the bad projects .
Why is it it came up ?
It &apos;s not saying that global warming is not happening .
It &apos;s not saying that it &apos;s not a big problem .
That &apos;s a substantial amount of money .
Yet it would do very little good .
Which is a little good , but not very much good .
Or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good ?
And that is really why it becomes a bad project .
The fourth best problem is malaria -- dealing with malaria .
This third best one was free trade .
That would be the third best thing we could do .
The second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition .
That would be the second best investment that we could do .
One is treatment ; the other one is prevention .
And treatment is much , much more expensive than prevention .
But of course , we don &apos;t do all problems .
There are many problems out there in the world .
Even the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the U.N.
And of course , we &apos;ll be even richer than that .
We &apos;re actually talking about a fairly rich Dutch guy .
It just doesn &apos;t make for as much of a movie .
Since then our aid has halved .
I &apos;m all for that .
The majority of them were , first , from developing countries .
We &apos;ve done this many other times .
They all come out with very much the same list .
I see the Copenhagen Consensus as a process .
Thank you .
Bill Gates : Mosquitos , malaria and education
Any tough problem , I think it can be solved .
Over the past century , average lifespan has more than doubled .
It &apos;s a phenomenal thing .
Each one of those lives matters a lot .
So we really can make changes .
And I think that &apos;s doable in well under 20 years .
Well , what &apos;s the history of this disease ?
It &apos;s been a severe disease for thousands of years .
So it was absolutely gigantic .
And the disease was all over the world .
So it was everywhere .
And two tools helped bring the death rate down .
One was killing the mosquitos with DDT .
And so that &apos;s why the death rate did come down .
So we can see : 1900 , it &apos;s everywhere .
1945 , it &apos;s still most places .
1990 , you &apos;ve gotten most of the northern areas .
Now , baldness , it &apos;s a terrible thing .
And rich men are afflicted .
And so that &apos;s why that priority has been set .
Now , malaria is of course transmitted by mosquitos .
I brought some here , just so you could experience this .
We &apos;ll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit .
There &apos;s no reason only poor people should have the experience .
Those mosquitos are not infected .
And bed nets are a great tool .
And that &apos;s happened now in a number of countries .
It &apos;s great to see .
And so you end up with two choices .
And that &apos;s where we saw the malaria map shrinking .
Now we &apos;re on the upswing .
Bed net funding is up .
There &apos;s new drug discovery going on .
So we &apos;re going to have these new tools .
But that alone doesn &apos;t give us the road map .
Of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise .
And this is : How do you make a teacher great ?
And the answer is , really , that we don &apos;t .
Let &apos;s start with why this is important .
We all had a wonderful education .
I had great teachers .
There are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places .
Not only has that been weak. it &apos;s getting weaker .
And we have to change this .
We have to change it so that people have equal opportunity .
Over 30 percent of kids never finish high school .
Because they weren &apos;t tracking where the kids were before that .
But most of the dropouts had taken place before that .
For minority kids , it &apos;s over 50 percent .
And that doesn &apos;t seem entirely fair .
So , how do you make education better ?
There &apos;s many people working on it .
A lot of these things had a good effect .
How much variation is there within a school or between schools ?
And the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable .
What does that mean ?
We should retain those people .
But I can tell you that absolutely is not happening today .
What are the characteristics of this top quartile ?
What do they look like ?
You might think these must be very senior teachers .
And the answer is no .
The variation is very , very small .
You might think these are people with master &apos;s degrees .
One is seniority .
Because your pay goes up and you vest into your pension .
Teach for America : slight effect .
For math teachers majoring in math there &apos;s a measurable effect .
But , overwhelmingly , it &apos;s your past performance .
There are some people who are very good at this .
And it &apos;s a system with very high turnover .
KIPP means Knowledge Is Power .
It &apos;s an unbelievable thing .
They &apos;re team teaching . They &apos;re constantly improving their teachers .
They &apos;re deeply engaged in making teaching better .
What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
Everybody needs to be involved .
And so KIPP is doing it .
How does that compare to a normal school ?
The data isn &apos;t gathered .
And they need advanced notice to do that .
And so that &apos;s sort of working in the opposite direction .
Of course , digital video is cheap now .
And they could all sit and work together on those problems .
And I thought it was so fantastic .
It gave you a sense of what a good teacher does .
But I -- I &apos;m optimistic .
I only had time to frame those two problems .
You know , the system doesn &apos;t naturally make it happen .
Governments don &apos;t naturally pick these things in the right way .
Thank you .
Suheir Hammad : Poems of war , peace , women , power
I will not dance to that beating .
I know that beat .
It is lifeless .
I know intimately that skin you are hitting .
It was alive once , hunted , stolen , stretched .
I will not dance to your drummed-up war .
I will not pop , spin , break for you .
I will not hate for you or even hate you .
I will not kill for you .
Especially I will not die for you .
I will not mourn the dead with murder nor suicide .
Everyone can be wrong .
Life is a right , not collateral or casual .
I will not forget where I come from .
I will craft my own drum .
Gather my beloved near , and our chanting will be dancing .
Our humming will be drumming .
I will not be played .
I will dance and resist and dance and persist and dance .
This heartbeat is louder than death .
Your war drum ain &apos;t louder than this breath . Haaa .
A bunch of pacifists .
Confused , aspiring pacifists .
I understand .
I &apos;ve been wrong a lot lately .
Like a lot .
So I couldn &apos;t figure out what to read today .
I mean , I &apos;ve been saying I &apos;ve been prepping .
Poetry does that .
It preps you . It aims you .
Hold her now with you .
Are you holding her ?
This is &quot; Break Clustered . &quot;
All holy history banned .
Unwritten books predicted the future , projected the past .
Whose son shall it be ?
Which male child will perish a new day ?
Our boys &apos; deaths galvanize .
We cherish corpses .
We mourn women , complicated .
Bitches get beat daily .
Profits made , prophets ignored .
War and tooth , enameled salted lemon childhoods .
All colors run , none of us solid .
I live cycles of light and darkness .
Rhythm is half silence .
Sickness , health , tender violence .
I think now I never was pure .
Human contracted itself blind , malignant .
I never was pure .
Girl spoiled before ripened .
Language can &apos;t math me .
I experience exponentially .
Everything is everything .
One woman loses six .
One woman loses her head .
One woman searches rubble . One woman feeds on trash .
One woman shoots her face . One woman shoots her husband .
One woman straps herself .
One woman gives birth to a baby .
One woman gives birth to borders .
One woman no longer believes love will ever find her .
One woman never did .
Where do refugee hearts go ?
Faced with absence .
We mourn each one or we mean nothing at all .
My spine curves spiral .
Precipice running to and running from human beings .
Cluster bombs left behind .
De facto landmines .
A smoldering grief .
Harvest contaminated tobacco .
Harvest bombs .
Harvest baby teeth .
Harvest palms , smoke .
Harvest witness , smoke .
Resolutions , smoke .
Salvation , smoke .
Redemption , smoke .
Breathe .
Do not fear what has blown up .
If you must , fear the unexploded .
Thank you .
Saul Griffith : High-altitude wind energy from kites !
But kites aren &apos;t just toys like this .
So they knew at that stage they could carry large weights .
And that was fantastic for the future of commercial aviation .
So this is the dawn of the new age of kites .
It makes you a little nauseous .
And this is where we &apos;re actually going .
So we &apos;re beyond the 12-second steps .
So you ask , how big are those machines ?
Well , this paper plane would be maybe a -- oop !
That would be enough to power your cell phone .
Your Cessna would be 230 killowatts .
And the Spruce Goose would be a 15-megawatt wing .
So that is audacious , you say . I agree .
But audacious is what has happened many times before in history .
By 1945 , they were making 100,000 .
I am lucky enough to work with 30 of them .
Thank you .
Matthieu Ricard : The habits of happiness
There &apos;s the Mount Kailash in Eastern Tibet -- wonderful setting .
This is from Marlboro country .
This is a turquoise lake .
A meditator .
They said , &quot; Yes , but it &apos;s summertime . &quot;
So now , we are going to speak of happiness .
We like the ups and downs of life .
Now , let &apos;s come to happiness or well-being .
And that can also come from some kind of confusions .
One of the most common ones is happiness and pleasure .
It is something that -- changes of nature .
That &apos;s the nature of things . We get tired .
I can hear it two , three , five times .
It sort of uses itself as you experience it .
Now , what , then , will be happiness ?
For you , that might be surprising .
Because we are speaking of a different level .
Look at the waves coming here to shore .
You hit the solid rock .
So now , how is that ?
Even joy -- that can be the spring of happiness .
That very sentence already reveals the doom of destruction of happiness .
To have everything . If we miss something , it collapses .
And isn &apos;t that stronger ?
The experience that translates everything is within the mind .
So then , this just needs to have some experience .
There are some which are adverse to this well-being .
And also , they are detrimental to others &apos; happiness .
And we would like to be like that all the time .
You can have ugly faces , beautiful faces in the mirror .
That is the ground for mind training .
You could go from love to hate .
Benevolence , loving kindness against hatred .
So then , it &apos;s a self-perpetuating process .
Look at anger itself .
So this is the principal of mind training .
But that &apos;s the only way to go .
Mind transformation -- that is the very meaning of meditation .
So can we do that with human qualities ?
With loving kindness , with patience , with openness ?
So that &apos;s what those great meditators have been doing .
They are real Olympic champions of mind training .
Now , here with 256 electrodes .
So what did they find ? Of course , same thing .
It deals with the state of compassion , unconditional compassion .
It &apos;s something that is totally out of the bell curve .
Hopefully , they will come .
Like the startle experiments , for example .
This is not a supplementary vitamin for the soul .
We are ready to spend 15 years achieving education .
We love to do jogging , fitness .
We do all kinds of things to remain beautiful .
Now , our compassion is supposed to be put in action .
That &apos;s what we try to do in different places .
Just this one example is worth a lot of work .
One year later , how she is .
Different schools and clinics we &apos;ve been doing in Tibet .
And jumping monks of Tibet .
Flying monks .
Thank you very much .
Ariel Garten : Know thyself , with a brain scanner
&quot; Know thyself . &quot;
&quot; Know thyself . &quot;
I &apos;ve always been fascinated with knowing the self .
We &apos;ve cluttered ourselves up with all this .
It &apos;s really only a successful escape .
Think of the term we use , &quot; Retreat . &quot;
It means we &apos;ve got to get out of here .
And eventually that vacation &apos;s got to come to an end .
I say the answer is yes .
It &apos;s called thought-controlled computing .
Let me show you what it looks like .
That blue line there is my brainwave .
You &apos;re actually looking inside my head as I speak .
We were transcending the space between the mind and the device .
So controlling stuff with your mind is pretty cool .
But we &apos;re always interested in multi-tiered levels of human interaction .
And that was responsiveness .
And it could join into the relationship with you .
They followed these little shifts in your mental activity .
When you read , the desk lamp would get brighter .
That you could know something about yourself .
Here &apos;s an application that I created for the iPad .
So you use it with your headset .
The headset connects wirelessly to an iPad or a smartphone .
As you focus on the wooden form , it rotates .
The more you focus , the faster the rotation .
This is for real .
This is not a fake .
I like to call this &quot; intra-active . &quot;
Normally we think about technology as interactive .
This technology is intra-active .
So you can create applications that reward focused brain states .
This can be as effective as Ritalin .
It would be like plugging into your own personal Google .
Would you get a divorce ?
Two millennia ago , those Greeks had some powerful insights .
One moment it was all white space , pure possibility .
Thank you .
Graham Hill : Less stuff , more happiness
What &apos;s in the box ?
Sound familiar ?
Three times .
Nope .
So where does this lead ?
It &apos;s actually a great way to save you some money .
By buying a space that was 420 sq. ft .
instead of 600 , immediately I &apos;m saving 200 grand .
So how can you live little ?
Three main approaches .
First of all , you have to edit ruthlessly .
We &apos;ve got to clear the arteries of our lives .
And that shirt that I hadn &apos;t worn in years ?
It &apos;s time for me to let it go .
We need to think before we buy .
Secondly , our new mantra : small is sexy .
We want space efficiency .
Why have a six burner stove when you rarely use three ?
My office folds away , easily hidden .
My bed just pops out of the wall with two fingers .
And of course , my own movie theater .
But consider the benefits of an edited life .
Go from 3,000 to 2,000 , from 1,500 to 1,000 .
Would that give me a little more freedom ?
Maybe a little more time ? &quot;
What &apos;s in the box ?
It doesn &apos;t really matter .
I know I don &apos;t need it .
What &apos;s in yours ?
Maybe , just maybe , less might equal more .
So let &apos;s make room for the good stuff .
Thank you .
Hans Rosling : Asia &apos;s rise -- how and when
And that changed my mindset forever .
You see , I was a study nerd .
I loved statistics from a young age .
And I studied very much in Sweden .
In Sweden we read it once and then we went partying .
But I will start with a historical background .
I will start at 1858 .
1858 was a year of great technological advancement in the West .
And they were the first to &quot; Twitter &quot; transatlantically .
Because 1858 was also watershed year in the history of Asia .
And India was up to 89 years more of foreign domination .
It meant paying with opium for Chinese goods .
And let &apos;s see how much difference that can make .
The size of the bubble here is the population .
And I also bring an innovation here .
And we will see , you know .
And I will start the world like this .
India was not always like this level .
India was trying down here .
Can you see how it starts to move there ?
But really , really natural sovereignty was good for Japan .
And Japan is trying to move up there .
But careful now -- we are approaching the First World War .
United Kingdom is going down .
And now comes the Spanish flu also .
And then after the First World War , they continue up .
Not much has happened .
They have grown their population but not much more .
But they did recover quite fast afterwards .
And we are moving into the new world .
In 1947 India finally gained its independence .
And what happened ?
What happens in the after independence ?
You can see that the health started to improve .
Children started to go to school .
Health services were provided .
This is the Great Leap Forward , when China fell down .
It was central planning by Mao Tse Tung .
And they were catching up indeed .
And it was Deng Xiaoping coming out here .
Because catching mice is what the two cats wanted to do .
And the market reformer was successful there .
In &apos; 92 India follows with a market reform .
And here they march on . And will they catch up ?
This is the big question today .
There they are today .
Shanghai is already there .
And it &apos;s healthier than the United States .
The geographical , macro-geographical difference is not so big .
And here , Maharashtra , with Mumbai , is forging forward .
And that is not a bad thing , in itself .
Oh , they broke my frame .
Washington , D.C. went out here .
And I can understand him , because Washington , D.C.
It &apos;s quite interesting , isn &apos;t it ?
We have an enormous disparity in the world .
Now , back to my projections .
And then time here , from 1858 I start the world .
And we shall see what will happen with these countries .
Whereas U.K. and United States is getting richer and richer .
And after Second World War , United States is richer than U.K.
But independence is coming here .
Growth is starting , economic reform .
Look at , look at the United States .
Can you see the bubble ?
The bubbles , not my bubbles , but the financial bubbles .
You see it came down there .
And people interested in growth are turning their eyes towards Asia .
I can compare to Japan . This is Japan coming up .
You see , Japan did it like that .
We add Japan to it .
Can you see here what Japan did ?
Can be worse , can be better .
It &apos;s always difficult to predict , especially about the future .
I think I &apos;m in a difficult position here .
But what I &apos;m really worried about is war .
The 27th of July , 2048 is my 100th birthday .
Get your bookings in time . Thank you very much .
Carl Schoonover : How to look inside the brain
This is a thousand-year-old drawing of the brain .
It &apos;s a diagram of the visual system .
And some things look very familiar today .
You really would be kind of out of luck .
Nobody had had a glimpse of the brain &apos;s wiring .
It &apos;s gray , formless .
There &apos;s no structure . It won &apos;t tell you anything .
And this all changed in the late 19th century .
The computer was cracked open .
And it works in a very particular way .
It clears the forest , reveals the trees inside .
If everything had been labeled , nothing would have been visible .
So somehow it shows what &apos;s there .
And there &apos;s several ways of doing this .
But one of the most popular ones involves green fluorescent protein .
They have great explanatory power .
Thank you .
Lian Pin Koh : A drone &apos;s-eye view of conservation
So what is a drone ?
So what can we do with a conservation drone ?
But nests are not the only objects these drones can detect .
This is an oil palm plantation in Sumatra .
This is a recently logged forest , again in Sumatra .
Recently , we &apos;ve also begun experimenting with thermal imaging cameras .
We built our first prototype drones in Switzerland .
Building drones for us is a constant work in progress .
Radio collars are another tool that &apos;s commonly used by biologists .
Now these collars are put onto animals .
The MAJA drone has a wingspan of about two meters .
It is a fully autonomous system .
That is quite sufficient for most of our conservation applications .
And in a way , they are right .
Thank you .
Anthony Atala : Printing a human kidney
The fact is that we &apos;re living longer .
So this is now a public health crisis .
It really involves many different areas .
Or we can use both .
We can use , actually , biomaterials and the cells together .
And that &apos;s where the field is today .
But it &apos;s actually not a new field .
It &apos;s titled &quot; The Culture of Organs . &quot;
The first author , Alexis Carrel , a Nobel Prize winner .
But I want you to note his co-author : Charles Lindbergh .
And that really has to do to many different challenges .
And many advances now , we can do that fairly readily .
The second challenge was cells .
Over the last 20 years , we &apos;ve basically tackled that .
Many scientists can now grow many different types of cells .
Plus we have stem cells .
So we can actually use biomaterials now .
This is actually a biomaterial .
This is actually like a cotton candy machine .
You saw the spray going in .
And that &apos;s exactly what we did here .
We can also use cells alone .
These are actually cells that we obtained .
So they know what to do .
So that &apos;s actually now in patients .
Another technology that we have used in patients actually involves bladders .
We then put it in this oven-like device .
For these specific patients , we actually just suture these materials .
Another technology that we &apos;ve used is actually that of printing .
And then finally you &apos;re able to get that structure out .
That was all new bone that was implanted using these techniques .
That &apos;s what you see here on the right side .
This is how it actually works .
Here &apos;s the scanner going through , scanning the wound .
And this is actually new technology still under development .
We &apos;re also working on more sophisticated printers .
Because in reality , our biggest challenge are the solid organs .
This actually shows the actual printer .
And this actually shows that printing .
In fact , we actually have the printer right here .
Put a pair of gloves here .
Thank you .
Go backwards .
Has a little bit of consistency to it .
Thank you , Dr. Kang . I appreciate it .
So this is actually a new generation .
This is actually the printer that you see here onstage .
I was missing school . It was pretty much miserable .
I felt so sick .
I was able to do more things .
I was able to wrestle in high school .
I was able to be a normal kid with my friends .
Luke , come up please .
JE : And Tony &apos;s done hundreds of these ?
I pulled them aside .
Thank you so much .
JE : Thank you , Tony .
Tom Shannon , John Hockenberry : The painter and the pendulum
And I did one that was about 35 feet long .
JH : Is there a relief in playing with these forces ?
TS : Those are permanent magnets , yeah .
TS : Yeah .
It &apos;s really unsatisfactory having plug-in art .
JH : I agree .
My sculptures are normally very simplified .
I try to refine them down to very simple forms .
JH : And they &apos;re non-deterministic .
TS : No .
But then I started dreaming of having six colors .
JH : It looks like we &apos;re loaded for bear here .
JH : Thanks guys .
JH : Whoa . That is ...
ooh , nice .
TS : So something like this .
JH : That &apos;s fantastic .
JH : So many forces there .
Like the occurrence of moire patterns .
TS : It is the paint actually , makes it real .
It &apos;s really manifested there .
There are lots of things that appear .
So I think , conceivably , those could be predictive .
Is that relevant to your work ?
I mean , I &apos;ve got the symptoms .
I &apos;m left-handed , and so I draw .
JH : So you &apos;re not a gatekeeper for these forces .
You think of yourself as the servant .
TS : Nature is -- well , it &apos;s a godsend .
It just has so much in it .
And we are expressions of the universe , basically .
It &apos;s a terrific studio assistant .
TS : Thank you , John .
Moshe Safdie : How to reinvent the apartment building
We traveled the country .
Those who have no choice lived there .
There has to be another way of doing this .
It &apos;s a very desirable place to live in .
In 1973 , I made my first trip to China .
It was the Cultural Revolution .
We traveled the country , met with architects and planners .
Shenzhen didn &apos;t even exist as a city .
There were hardly any cars .
Thirty years later , this is Beijing today .
This is Hong Kong .
Could we make it more affordable ?
And we mapped all the building area in Manhattan .
It &apos;s permeable .
And most important , permeable , open .
That &apos;s measured in the winter solstice .
And Colombo .
And that &apos;s all I can tell you in five minutes .
Thank you .
Siegfried Woldhek : The search for the true face of Leonardo
Good morning .
But we do not know his face .
Even this well-known portrait is not accepted by many art historians .
So , what do you think ?
Let &apos;s find out .
Leonardo was a man that drew everything around him .
But no faces ?
I find that hard to believe .
So let &apos;s try to find them .
There are about 120 , you see them here .
Which ones of these could be self-portraits ?
So we can eliminate all the profiles .
It also has to be sufficiently detailed .
So we can also eliminate the ugly ones or the caricatures .
And here they are .
So I know a little about drawing and analyzing faces .
OK , now let &apos;s look at these three portraits .
I couldn &apos;t believe my eyes when I first saw that .
There is no reason why these portraits should look alike .
Now , are they made in the right order ?
The young man should be made first .
They are made in the right order .
Well , we need a reference .
Ladies and gentlemen , this story has not yet been published .
The icon of icons finally has a face .
Here he is : Leonardo da Vinci .
Eric Dishman : Health care should be a team sport
They don &apos;t know anything about you . Wake up .
And I did .
It &apos;s unaffordable globally .
We need to invent what I call a personal health system .
This is the kidney transplant I was never supposed to have .
Don &apos;t you in the front row worry or anything .
This is a portable ultrasound .
All right , I gotta gel up .
Now the people in the front row are very nervous .
And actually , can you see Libby ?
Thomas Batuik : Hi there , Eric .
You look busy . How are you ?
Should I do that again ?
TB : Yeah , let &apos;s do that .
It &apos;s not something I was very happy about .
So let &apos;s start with care anywhere .
This was me in third grade .
Recovering from the surgery in the hospital , I get bedsores .
Now the software is also getting smarter , right ?
And I have these palpitations that are showing up .
I had a care coordination problem .
And this happens to millions of people every year .
Now this is the most frightening thing to me .
And this is a picture of my graduation team from Legacy .
I wept the day I graduated .
And here &apos;s the most important part .
That &apos;s the only way that the model works .
And I think that &apos;s why I achieved longevity .
Tracey Gamley : For me , it was really easy .
I only had one night in the hospital .
Dennis Hong : My seven species of robot
So , the first robot to talk about is called STriDER .
It stands for Self-excited Tripedal Dynamic Experimental Robot .
But before that , let &apos;s look at pop culture .
But my robot , STriDER , does not move like this .
So , this is an actual dynamic simulation animation .
I &apos;m just going to show you how the robot works .
We call that the concept of passive dynamic locomotion .
potential energy to kinetic energy , potential energy to kinetic energy .
It &apos;s a constantly falling process .
So we have two prototypes .
The first version , in the back , that &apos;s STriDER I.
The one in front , the smaller , is STriDER II .
The second robot I want to talk about is called IMPASS .
It stands for Intelligent Mobility Platform with Actuated Spoke System .
So , it &apos;s a wheel-leg hybrid robot .
We are literally re-inventing the wheel here .
Let me demonstrate how it works .
You probably haven &apos;t seen anything like this out there .
Ah , isn &apos;t that cool ?
The front wheels rotate like this .
We just simply change the length of the spoke .
But the current rovers cannot get there .
So , this is CLIMBeR .
Also for search and rescue applications as well .
And they already had a six legged robot called LEMUR .
We developed our adaptive gait planner .
We actually have a very interesting payload on there .
We get so many visitors visiting our lab .
Welcome to RoMeLa , the Robotics Mechanisms Laboratory at Virginia Tech .
This robot is an amoeba robot .
So , this is some of the early feasibility experiments .
Robotic Air Powered Hand with Elastic Ligaments .
We developed these novel actuators for joints .
And it can actually crush an empty soda can .
This is a robot that can climb structures .
This is a HyDRAS &apos;s arm .
It &apos;s a 12 degrees of freedom robotic arm .
But the cool part is the user interface .
The cable over there , that &apos;s an optical fiber .
Now , this robot is currently our star robot .
So , this does not have any sensors .
So , it &apos;s an open loop control .
And thus , DARwIn I was born in 2005 .
It stands up , it walks -- very impressive .
And now DARwIn II is completely autonomous .
It is not remote controlled .
It &apos;s an international autonomous robot soccer competition .
So , this is last year in China .
This is this year in Austria .
There you go . Yes !
The robots track and they team play amongst themselves .
Louis Vuitton Cup trophy .
Thank you .
DARwIn also has a lot of other talents .
And it walks away . So , this is DARwIn IV .
So , what is the secret of our success ?
Where do we come up with these ideas ?
How do we develop these kinds of ideas ?
We call it the Blind Driver Challenge , very exciting .
So , really , we have five secrets .
First is : Where do we get inspiration ?
Where do we get this spark of imagination ?
This is a true story , my personal story .
And they assemble , and they form these kinds of mechanisms .
And then I think , &quot; Ah this is cool . &quot;
So , I need to decipher what I wrote .
But just a spark of imagination is not good enough .
How do we develop these kinds of ideas ?
But before we start we set this golden rule .
The rule is : Nobody criticizes anybody &apos;s ideas .
Nobody criticizes any opinion .
And this is how we develop our ideas .
He gave a talk about how education and school kills creativity .
Well , actually , there are two sides to the story .
Math , differential equations .
These are all the tools that we need .
So , education is very important .
There you go . Thank you so much .
Mikko Hypponen : Fighting viruses , defending the net
I love the Internet .
It &apos;s true .
Think about everything it has brought us .
And it &apos;s happening during our lifetimes .
I &apos;ve spent my career fighting these problems .
So let me show you something .
This here is Brain .
It &apos;s the first virus we ever found for PC computers .
And we actually know where Brain came from .
We know because it says so inside the code .
Let &apos;s take a look .
All right .
And Basit and Amjad are first names , Pakistani first names .
Now , 1986 .
Now it &apos;s 2011 .
That &apos;s 25 years ago .
The PC virus problem is 25 years old now .
Here &apos;s a typical street view .
And I knocked on the door .
You want to guess who opened the door ?
Basit and Amjad ; they are still there .
So here standing up is Basit .
Sitting down is his brother Amjad .
These are the guys who wrote the first PC virus .
Now of course , we had a very interesting discussion .
I asked them why .
I asked them how they feel about what they started .
So let me just mount some drives . Go over there .
What we have here is a list of old viruses .
So let me just run some viruses on my computer .
For example , let &apos;s go with the Centipede virus first .
You know that you &apos;re infected because it actually shows up .
Let me show you one which actually makes some sound .
And the last example , guess what the Walker virus does ?
Today , viruses are a global problem .
And if we just scroll around , it &apos;s just massive .
We find tens of thousands , even hundreds of thousands .
So where are all these coming from then ?
It &apos;s gangs like -- let &apos;s go to GangstaBucks.com.
And they &apos;ll actually pay you money for those computers .
So how do these guys then monetize those infected computers ?
Same thing with every single password and so on .
And that , obviously , is a problem .
They are both right now on the run .
Nobody knows where they are .
So the amount of money online crime generates is significant .
They also use the global nature of Internet to their advantage .
I mean , the Internet is international .
That &apos;s why we call it the Internet .
So you just can &apos;t shut these guys down .
So how do you actually go around finding online criminals ?
How do you actually track them down ?
Let me give you an example .
What we have here is one exploit file .
It has been encrypted with XOR function 97 .
And we can go here and actually start decrypting it .
Well the yellow part of the code is now decrypted .
But just keep staring at it .
And that &apos;s a backdoor which will take over your computer .
It &apos;s not used for anything .
So obviously I Googled for it .
I got zero hits ; wasn &apos;t there .
So I spoke with the guys at the lab .
And he drives a very nice car .
How do I know about this car ?
Because he blogged about the car .
He actually had a car accident .
So what happens when online criminals are caught ?
Well in most cases it never gets this far .
I wish it would be easier ; unfortunately it isn &apos;t .
But things are also changing at a very rapid pace .
You &apos;ve all heard about things like Stuxnet .
And this is what runs our infrastructure .
This is what runs everything around us .
Because everything around us is being run by these .
I mean , we have critical infrastructure .
Everything is being run by computers .
Everything is reliant on these computers working .
Think about all the services we have online .
That &apos;s much more important than running anti-viruses or running firewalls .
Thank you very much .
Rogier van der Heide : Why light needs darkness
Well that was not by me .
So this is how we normally would light our offices .
The sun is for dynamics , for color changes .
So in an indirect way , you can see the sun .
They allowed themselves a few mistakes along the way .
They are in green energy consulting , or something like that .
I really owe a short introduction of this man to you .
So you begin with focal glow .
Ambient luminescence is something very different .
And we can only create these out of darkness .
And I will explain that further .
And you can imagine a lot more applications .
And it is all about this planet .
Because all this light here goes up to the sky .
It never reaches the ground where it was meant for .
It never is to the benefit of people .
It only spoils the darkness .
So at a global scale , it looks like this .
How do they share their culture ?
How do we tackle things like mobility ?
And how can light help there ?
So here it is .
And I will very quickly show you how it works .
So just to explain .
Now this is not very pleasant and comfortable .
So you can preserve the darkness and make the light .
Thank you .
We can go further .
So we have to rethink the way we light our cities .
We have to think again about light as a default solution .
Why are all these motorways permanently lit ?
Is it really needed ?
Can we be more gentle with light ?
Like here -- this is a very low light level actually .
And can we preserve the darkness ?
They are not disturbed anymore .
Where have they come from ? Where are they going ?
We can do that in commercial spaces like this .
In architecture , it works just the same .
It wouldn &apos;t be such an inspiring scenography without this theater .
Thank you very much .
Eva Zeisel : The playful search for beauty
And I am illustrating Still .
So this takes care of my age .
This was about 1925 .
All of these things were made during the last 75 years .
This was an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art .
This is now for sale at the Metropolitan Museum .
This is still at the Metropolitan Museum now for sale .
This is a portrait of my daughter and myself .
These were just some of the things I &apos;ve made .
I made hundreds of them for the last 75 years .
I call myself a maker of things .
Industrial designers want to make novel things .
Novelty is a concept of commerce , not an aesthetic concept .
Innovation is not part of the aim of my work .
Let me tell you some about my life .
The work as an apprentice was very primitive .
And then finally it was prepared for the throwing .
And there I really worked as an apprentice .
I said , I also have a pottery .
I remember that it was quite successful .
And that was in Hamburg .
This was my first job .
Eva Zeisel : Are you sure ?
Moderator : Yes , I am sure .
This was a very dangerous accusation .
Weren &apos;t you there recently ?
Bonnie Bassler : How bacteria &quot; talk &quot;
Bacteria are the oldest living organisms on the earth .
You have about 30,000 genes .
We &apos;re not doing anything to the cells here .
This is now supposed to be my bacterial cell .
When it &apos;s alone it doesn &apos;t make any light .
This is like the stealth bomber of the ocean .
Bacteria always control pathogenicity with quorum sensing .
That &apos;s how it works .
This is the Vibrio fischeri molecule .
This is the word that it talks with .
Each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other .
So these are private , secret conversations .
These conversations are for intraspecies communication .
It &apos;s a very small , five-carbon molecule .
So they &apos;re all using this molecule for interspecies communication .
This is the bacterial Esperanto .
Couldn &apos;t these be new kinds of antibiotics ?
The first one is we &apos;ve targeted the intraspecies communication system .
We &apos;ve also done the same thing with the pink system .
To finish I &apos;ll just show you the strategy .
We think bacteria made the rules for how multicellular organization works .
This is exactly what happens in your body .
Science is done by that demographic .
It &apos;s a really lucky demographic to work with .
I want to thank you for inviting me here .
Thanks .
Richard Baraniuk : The birth of the open-source learning revolution
I &apos;m Rich Baraniuk .
Does anybody remember these ?
Today &apos;s hit single is not last year &apos;s hit single .
But , I &apos;m not here to talk about music today .
I &apos;m here to talk about books .
Has anyone here ever been to school ?
So , imagine taking all the world &apos;s books .
Think of it as a massive iTunes for book type content .
In fact , this dream is actually being realized .
We &apos;re working on the open-source tools and the content .
Her material is now used over 600,000 times per month .
Tremendous , tremendous use .
What about copying , reusing , right ?
A little present for you .
It &apos;s about 300 pages long , hardbound .
This costs , anybody guess ?
How much would it cost in a bookstore ?
Audience : 65 dollars .
Richard Baraniuk : This costs 22 dollars to the student .
Why does it cost 22 dollars ?
We &apos;re talking about books on hyper geometric partial differential equations .
OK , so what are the enablers ?
What &apos;s really making all of this happen ?
How many people know about XML ?
Remember we took the book , tore the pages out ?
So imagine your kid &apos;s algebra textbook in seventh grade .
The same type of mark-up , like mathML , for chemistry .
Even the three wise men .
We can &apos;t let this Napster thing happen here .
And the ideas , the creative commons licenses .
How many people have heard of creative commons ?
If you have not , you must learn about it . Creativecommons.org.
We &apos;re not talking about Harry Potter , right ?
We &apos;re at the long tail end here .
How do we protect it into the future ?
So that could be a problem .
Connexions and open content is all about sharing knowledge .
So , thanks very much .
Sam Martin : Claim your &quot; manspace &quot;
It had everything I needed . It was quiet .
So I did some research .
And I found that there was an historic precedence .
Hemingway had his writing space .
But on the inside , it &apos;s anything but .
And this , to me , is a pretty classic manspace .
And he found the scoreboard in the trash .
Here &apos;s another outdoor space , a little bit more sophisticated .
The guy did it all himself .
And there is about 1,000 square feet of hanging-out space inside .
There were definitely hang-out spots .
Take this place for example .
On the outside it looks like a typical northeastern garage .
This is in Long Island , New York .
It has no nails or screws .
All the joints are hand-carved and hand-scribed .
And so there is a good reason for this .
It was built by this man who is Wayne McCullough .
Museum quality .
And they were unexpected and they were surprising .
And they really loved their professions .
And they were very passionate about their collections and their hobbies .
Thank you very much .
Stefon Harris : There are no mistakes on the bandstand
It is really a sacred space .
You really are alive right here in this moment .
But that could have happened -- maybe , maybe not .
Everyone &apos;s listening . We &apos;re responding .
You have no time for projected ideas .
Every &quot; mistake &quot; is an opportunity in jazz .
So if Christian played a note -- like play an F.
See , these are all right inside of the color palette .
If you played an E.
And we &apos;re going to play on this palette .
And at some point , Christian will introduce this note .
And we won &apos;t react to it .
We &apos;ll see what happens when we play with this palette .
So someone could conceptually perceive that as a mistake .
It was an opportunity that was missed .
So it &apos;s unpredictable . We &apos;ll paint this palette again .
We &apos;ll all accept his ideas , or not .
So you see , he played this note .
I ended up creating a melody out of it .
The texture changed in the drums this time .
So there is no mistake .
So jazz , this bandstand is absolutely amazing .
It &apos;s a very purifying experience .
So how does this all relate to behavioral finance ?
You have some people who do .
But what that does is it actually limits the artistic possibilities .
ready , just play some time .
One , two , one , two , three , four .
It &apos;s kind of chaotic because I &apos;m bullying my ideas .
This is a science of listening .
Totally different experience when I &apos;m pulling ideas .
It &apos;s much more organic . It &apos;s much more nuanced .
It &apos;s not about bullying my vision or anything like that .
Thank you .
One is the Thylacine Project .
We &apos;ve lost a whole family .
That &apos;s a big chunk of the global genome gone .
I &apos;d like it back .
The second reason is that we killed these things .
Okay . Let me talk to you about the Lazarus Project .
It &apos;s a frog . And you think , frog .
Yeah , but this was not just any frog .
Now , when biologists saw this , they were agog .
They thought , this is incredible .
And just as everybody got excited about it , bang !
It was extinct .
Well , we looked at the tissue under the microscope .
So we thought , let &apos;s give it a go .
What we did is something called somatic cell nuclear transplantation .
We used ultraviolet radiation to do that .
That was a miracle , but it was workable .
That was so exciting . And then the egg divided again .
So we &apos;re very excited . This is not a tadpole .
Thank you .
But it &apos;s not related to any of those .
But it &apos;s also a tragic history .
In those fossil rocks are some amazing animals .
We found marsupial lions .
We found carnivorous kangaroos .
And crocodiles were not behaving at that time either .
That similarity meant they probably competed .
They were eating the same kinds of foods .
That guy is going to eat all our sheep .
That was not what happened , actually .
Have a look at this bit of film footage .
Does it have to stay this way ?
In 1990 , I was in the Australian Museum .
The geneticists laughed . But this was six years before Dolly .
Cloning was science fiction . It had not happened .
But then suddenly cloning did happen .
I put a team together .
We were very excited .
Unfortunately , we also found a lot of human DNA .
We found nuclear mitochondrial genes . It &apos;s there .
So we got it .
Okay . What could we do with this stuff ?
It has to be a different species .
They &apos;re related distantly to thylacines .
Critics of this project say , hang on .
Thylacine , Tasmanian devil ? That &apos;s going to hurt .
No , it &apos;s not . These are marsupials .
Is this a risk ?
Are we going to get a Frankenstein ?
You know , some kind of weird hybrid chimera ?
And the answer is no .
This is a key question for everybody .
He led them around on a rope .
We &apos;d all love to have this sort of thing happen .
My interest was in whether the environment had changed .
He looked at the hut . We went inside .
The grasslands were sweeping away .
That &apos;s classic thylacine habitat .
So could we put it back ? Yes .
We need other parallel strategies coming online .
And this one interests me .
And I &apos;m positive it wouldn &apos;t .
We need to think about this in today &apos;s world .
Thank you .
Mohamed Hijri : A simple solution to the coming phosphorus crisis
Okay , so most of you are .
I think we can all agree it &apos;s a serious issue .
Right ?
For the simple reason that nobody else is talking about it .
The answer is that it comes from how we farm .
We use fertilizers in our farming , chemical fertilizers .
Why do we use chemical fertilizers in agriculture ?
So , what does a plant need in order to grow ?
So , the plant &apos;s roots will extract these resources .
Why phosphorus in particular ?
Because it is the most problematic chemical element .
Cell membranes are phosphorus-based : These are called phospholipids .
The energy in all living things , ATP , is phosphorus-based .
DNA is our genetic heritage .
Now , where do we find this phosphorus ?
As humans , where do we find it ?
It &apos;s true that some humans eat better than others .
Some are happier than others .
Intensive agriculture is based on the use of chemical fertilizers .
Let me explain .
You &apos;re going to tell me it &apos;s wasteful .
Eighty percent of each dose of phosphorus is lost .
Modern agriculture depends on phosphorus .
Now , where will we get this phosphorus from ?
Basically , we get it out of mines .
So that really puts it into perspective .
So , we get phosphorus from mines .
What is the current state of the world &apos;s phosphorus reserves ?
The black line represents predictions for phosphorus reserves .
In 2030 , we &apos;ll reach the peak .
The dotted line shows where we are today .
Do we have a solution ?
Less and less phosphorus will be available .
What should we do ?
It truly is a paradoxical situation .
Remember that 80 percent is destined to be lost .
This mushroom exists in symbiosis with the roots .
This slide illustrates the elements of a mycorrhiza .
Normally , a root will find phosphorus all by itself .
Beyond one millimeter , the root is ineffective .
It cannot go further in its search for phosphorus .
Now , imagine this tiny , microscopic mushroom .
And it is through this structure that mutual exchanges will occur .
True symbiosis .
A very small amount of phosphorus will remain in the soil .
That &apos;s completely natural .
The plant is only able to seek out soluble forms .
These are trials in a field of sorghum .
With only a half-dose , we achieved a better yield .
This is to show you that this method works .
This is an example of soy production in Canada .
Mycorrhiza was used in one field but not in the other .
The problem is that people are not aware of it .
In conclusion , I am a scientist and a dreamer .
I &apos;m passionate about this topic .
Thank you for your attention .
To the first son , he left half the camels .
Well three sons got into a negotiation .
Seventeen doesn &apos;t divide by two .
It doesn &apos;t divide by three .
It doesn &apos;t divide by nine .
Brotherly tempers started to get strained .
So then they had 18 camels .
You get 17 .
They had one camel left over .
They gave it back to the wise old woman .
I basically see humanity a bit like those three brothers .
We &apos;re all one family .
That &apos;s the question .
It &apos;s actually surprisingly simple .
It &apos;s not easy , but it &apos;s simple .
It &apos;s not even new .
It may be one of our most ancient human heritages .
The secret to peace is us .
Let me give you just a story , an example .
So how do they deal with their differences ?
That system , I call the &quot; third side . &quot;
And we can play an incredibly constructive role .
It &apos;s very easy to react .
Human beings -- we &apos;re reaction machines .
And so the third side reminds us of that .
There was a war going on , as you know .
Look at what you Americans are doing in Puerto Rico . &quot;
The conversation got back on track .
Question is : where &apos;s the third side there ?
How could we possibly go to the balcony ?
Let me just ask you one question first .
Just out of curiosity , how many of you ?
Okay , so the great majority of us .
And here , it &apos;s so far away .
Why do we pay so much attention to this conflict ?
Is it the number of deaths ?
Stories matter . As an anthropologist , I know that .
Stories are what we use to transmit knowledge .
They give meaning to our lives .
Stories are the key .
What would that mean ? What is the story there ?
What &apos;s the origin story of the Middle East ?
That man , of course , was Abraham .
He &apos;s the father of us all .
That &apos;s what he &apos;s known for , his hospitality .
Today we face the scourge of terrorism .
What is terrorism ?
What &apos;s the opposite of terrorism ?
What if that could be a vaccine against religious intolerance ?
How would you bring that story to life ?
And that was my thinking of how would you do that .
And that &apos;s what comes to the first step here .
You retrace the footsteps of Abraham .
Because walking has a real power .
Who fights while they walk ?
People said , &quot; That &apos;s crazy . You can &apos;t .
You &apos;ve got to cross all these borders .
And so we studied the idea at Harvard .
We did our due diligence .
So effectively , we went from womb to tomb .
Let me ask you a question .
How many of you have ever had that experience ?
That &apos;s the essence of the Abraham path .
He &apos;s alive ; he &apos;s a living presence .
It &apos;s an amazing experience .
It was Abraham Path Day .
The media love it ; they really adore it .
It brought us hope .
And so that &apos;s what it &apos;s about .
She &apos;s desperately poor .
They sit on the floor .
She doesn &apos;t even have a tablecloth .
That &apos;s the potential of the Abraham path .
The potential is basically to change the game .
And in that sense , the Abraham path is a game-changer .
Let me just show you one thing .
What would the oak tree look like ?
It was done in South Africa .
It was done in Northern Ireland .
It could be done anywhere .
It simply depends on us .
It depends on us taking the third side .
We &apos;re about to take a break in a moment .
That &apos;s a third side act .
That &apos;s walking Abraham &apos;s path .
After a TEDTalk , why not a TEDWalk ?
So let me just leave you with three things .
One is , the secret to peace is the third side .
The third side is us .
Thank you very much .
Shereen El Feki : A little-told tale of sex and sensuality
&quot; I have two medical certificates to prove it . &quot;
I &apos;m half Egyptian , and I &apos;m Muslim .
The first of these is politics .
That second red line is religion .
Audience : Sex .
Shereen El Feki : Louder , I can &apos;t hear you .
Audience : Sex .
SEF : Again , please don &apos;t be shy .
Audience : Sex .
SEF : Absolutely , that &apos;s right , it &apos;s sex .
Marriage is your ticket to adulthood .
Faiza was living proof of this .
Her virginity statement was not a piece of wishful thinking .
Faiza chose a different route : non-vaginal sex .
Only she became pregnant all the same .
Sadly , Faiza is not alone .
Football , everybody talks about it , but hardly anyone plays .
Hot stuff !
Today , this history is largely unknown in the Arab region .
no matter where we live and love .
Thank you .
iO Tillett Wright : Fifty shades of gay
What &apos;s your name ? Where are you from ?
How old are you ? What do you do ?
Then we get more personal with it .
Have you ever had any diseases ?
Have you ever been divorced ?
What are you into ? Who are you into ?
What gender do you like to sleep with ?
I get it .
We are neurologically hardwired to seek out people like ourselves .
We seek out environments that reinforce our personal choices .
Because the categories , I &apos;ve found , are too limiting .
The boxes are too narrow .
And this can get really dangerous .
I grew up in a very sheltered environment .
They said they wouldn &apos;t let girls play .
I mean , who knows , right ?
When you &apos;re six , maybe you can do that .
I kept up the charade for eight years .
So this is me when I was 11 .
I didn &apos;t feel like I was in the wrong body .
I felt like I was performing this elaborate act .
I wouldn &apos;t have qualified as transgender .
No one is exactly shocked .
But I wasn &apos;t asked to define myself by my parents .
I was legally and indisputably a second-class citizen .
I was not an activist .
I wave no flags in my own life .
Were we even a group ? What group ?
It might give them pause .
And they funded two weeks of shooting in New York .
And then we made this .
Self Evident Truths is a photographic record of LGBTQ America today .
It &apos;s written in the Declaration of Independence .
There is no equality in the United States .
The fight for equal rights is not just about gay marriage .
So far we &apos;ve shot 300 faces in New York City .
I want to take the project across the country .
Absolutely nothing could have prepared us for what happened after that .
So I changed my immediate goal to 10,000 faces .
Visibility really is key .
Familiarity really is the gateway drug to empathy .
Sparking empathy had become the backbone of Self Evident Truths .
In fact , on the contrary , it highlights them .
Can you quantify your openness ?
I &apos;ll take your picture just for trying .
And the reality that this presents is a complicated one .
Where exactly does one become a second-class citizen ?
What we see are human beings in all their multiplicity .
And seeing them makes it harder to deny their humanity .
It &apos;s too late .
Because I already am all of those things .
Thank you .
I just wanted you to know that .
So as I said , neurosurgery comes from a long tradition .
It &apos;s been around for about 7,000 years .
They didn &apos;t know exactly what they were doing .
Not much has changed , by the way .
But this was common .
We can turn it up or down , on or off .
So this looks something like this .
That &apos;s a little better . That side is better .
We &apos;re now going to turn it on .
It &apos;s on . Just turned it on .
And this works like that , instantly .
We want you to stop doing that . &quot;
And we do that with electricity .
So dystonia is a disorder affecting children .
There are eight children in the family .
Five of them have dystonia .
So here he is .
So he is one of five kids .
He did not respond to any drugs .
We did not know what to do with this boy .
It is the sadness center of the brain .
And so patients with depression have hyperactivity .
The area of the brain for sadness is on red hot .
So we went ahead and implanted electrodes in patients with depression .
This is work done with my colleague Helen Mayberg from Emory .
Can we use deep brain stimulation to make you smarter ?
Anybody interested in that ?
Of course we can , right ?
Now we &apos;re not going to do this in normal people .
They shut down . They turn off .
These areas of the brain are shut down .
The lights are out in these areas of the brain .
So this is now in clinical trials .
We can now reach those circuits .
We can introduce electrodes within those circuits .
We can graduate the activity of those circuits .
Thank you very much .
Damon Horowitz : Philosophy in prison
Meet Tony . He &apos;s my student .
There &apos;s the punk on the ground , puddle of blood .
I know what is wrong . I have done wrong .
You think you know right and wrong ?
Then can you tell me what wrong is ?
No , don &apos;t just give me an example .
What is that idea ?
What makes something wrong ?
Maybe one of us is wrong about the wrong .
We are here for knowledge .
Our enemy is thoughtlessness . This is philosophy . &quot;
And something changes for Tony .
I want to know what is wrong .
I want to know what I know . &quot;
What can creatures like us know of such things ?
Socrates died in prison , his philosophy intact .
So Tony starts doing his homework .
Turns out , Tony &apos;s got the philosophy muscle .
His body is in prison , but his mind is free .
That &apos;s Plato , Descartes , Nietzsche and Bill Clinton .
Let us think about that . &quot;
Thank you .
Halla Tomasdottir : A feminine response to Iceland &apos;s financial crash
First , of course , the economic meltdown .
Ninety-nine pence was the starting price and no reserve .
By the way , the pronunciation is &quot; Eyjafjallajokull . &quot;
None of your media got it right .
Raised quite a few eyebrows in Iceland .
So let me share with you our values .
We believe in risk awareness .
What does that mean ?
Not a complicated thing .
We care how we make our profit .
It was also about a business opportunity .
Will government change ?
Well I &apos;ll give you my straight talk about this .
Like TED , I believe in people .
Women in Iceland took the day off .
And some say this was the start of a global movement .
So we should embrace our difference and aim for challenge .
We need to start embracing the beauty of balance .
Thank you .
Kate Hartman : The art of wearable communication
My name is Kate Hartman .
I teach courses in physical computing and wearable electronics .
And it &apos;s pretty simple .
Everybody &apos;s got one -- all of you .
Don &apos;t be ashamed .
So I make other hats as well .
This one is called the Talk to Yourself Hat .
It &apos;s fairly self-explanatory .
It physically carves out conversation space for one .
So what happens when a person puts this thing on ?
What kind of an experience do they have ?
And how are they transformed by wearing it ?
So this particular device is called the Gut Listener .
And some of these are actually meant to mediate experiences .
So the Discommunicator is a tool for arguments .
And I thought , &quot; Well , hey !
Because there seems to be an issue .
The glaciers are actually leaving us .
There &apos;s no kind of social protocol for this .
I really just don &apos;t even know how to say hello .
Do I carve a message in the snow ?
And I was really struck by how much it affected me .
So , yea , this is actually just the beginning .
These are initial musings for this project .
Thanks .
We are always chasing storms .
We are doing a thousand now .
And we hope to understand something fundamental about our human nature .
You can put it louder if you can .
This is a brain .
And you have a scheme here that describes how it works .
And that &apos;s exactly what we did 10 years ago .
And Aurora liked to play video games .
Actually any primate will do that .
Think about that .
And to our shock , that &apos;s exactly what Aurora did .
She played the game without moving her body .
Well , we did that 10 years ago .
Just fast forward 10 years .
And that &apos;s exactly what they do .
The animal is controlling the avatar to touch the targets .
And that &apos;s a picture that every neurophysiologist knows .
How far can we take it ?
So where are we taking all this ?
And you can see an image produced by this consortium .
I think I &apos;m going to follow my grandmother &apos;s advice .
Thank you .
Lisa Margonelli : The political chemistry of oil
The napalm is burning there quite nicely .
So this is what happens as that burn gets going .
It takes off . It &apos;s a big woosh .
It &apos;ll just bake your retinas .
Oil is a stew of hydrocarbon molecules .
They &apos;re very important in oil spills .
It is this chemistry that makes oil so disastrous .
Oil doesn &apos;t sink , it floats .
It also makes it very viscous .
It &apos;s incredibly hard to clean up .
And every single oil is different when it hits water .
They set the prices , and I don &apos;t even know .
I am helpless over this . &quot;
That shows you how bad it is .
And that &apos;s actually very perverse .
This is BP &apos;s gas station in downtown Los Angeles .
It is green . It is a shrine to greenishness .
And we get kind of in on our own con .
We talk about energy independence . We talk about hydrogen cars .
We talk about biofuels that haven &apos;t been invented yet .
It &apos;s the &quot; Beverly Hillbillies , &quot; basically .
And then , of course , there was John D. Rockefeller .
There were no lips .
Okay , so that guy is actually still with us .
And then there &apos;s this guy , okay .
So I &apos;m saying this is kind of a distraction .
You have these pictures of birds .
They really influence people .
It started Earth Day .
Everything that we are really stemmed from this period .
We connect the dots in the supply chain .
In fact , it &apos;s continued to increase .
We put it in . There was a tremendous banditry problem .
I was there in 2003 .
We pay for it in our taxes on April 15th .
It &apos;s become this intense industrialized zone .
And finally , American families also pay a price for oil .
We need to stay away from the moratoriums .
We need to focus really back again on the molecules .
We need to focus on reducing the oil .
We need to remove the perverse incentives to use more fuel .
We actually encourage people to drive more .
We need to have more mobility choices .
They &apos;re up at NewAmerica.net.
So you &apos;re not helpless at the pump .
That &apos;s a lot .
So , three million barrels a day .
Thank you .
Ludwick Marishane : A bath without water
The Limpopo sun gets really hot in winter .
Now we need to get this thing into practice .
I had invented DryBath , the world &apos;s first bath-substituting lotion .
So we packaged DryBath in these innovative little sachets .
At least once a week .
What &apos;s stopping you ?
I &apos;m not done yet . I &apos;m not done yet .
David Steindl-Rast : Want to be happy ? Be grateful
In this , we are all together .
Now my topic is gratefulness .
How is the connection between happiness and gratefulness ?
Many people would say , well , that &apos;s very easy .
When you are happy , you are grateful .
But think again .
Is it really the happy people that are grateful ?
They radiate happiness . You are surprised .
Why ? Because they are grateful .
So it is not happiness that makes us grateful .
It &apos;s gratefulness that makes us happy .
It &apos;s gratefulness that makes you happy .
And how does it work ?
I appeal to your own experience .
We all know from experience how it goes .
We experience something that &apos;s valuable to us .
Something is given to us that &apos;s valuable to us .
And it &apos;s really given .
These two things have to come together .
You haven &apos;t bought it . You haven &apos;t earned it .
It &apos;s just given to you .
That &apos;s how gratefulness happens .
We cannot only have grateful experiences .
We can be people who live gratefully .
Grateful living , that is the thing .
And how can we live gratefully ?
It &apos;s a gift . You haven &apos;t earned it .
You haven &apos;t brought it about in any way .
It &apos;s a given moment , as we say .
Well , think again .
Behold the master key to our happiness in our own hands .
Moment by moment , we can be grateful for this gift .
Does that mean that we can be grateful for everything ?
Certainly not .
But I didn &apos;t say we can be grateful for everything .
It isn &apos;t as bad as it might seem .
Learning patience , for instance .
That takes patience . That &apos;s difficult .
That &apos;s an opportunity that is given to us .
They make something out of life .
And those who fail get another opportunity .
We always get another opportunity .
That &apos;s the wonderful richness of life .
So how can we find a method that will harness this ?
How can we do it ?
It &apos;s a very simple method .
Stop . Look . Go .
That &apos;s all .
But how often do we stop ?
We rush through life . We don &apos;t stop .
We miss the opportunity because we don &apos;t stop .
We have to stop . We have to get quiet .
And we have to build stop signs into our lives .
Every time I turned on the faucet , I was overwhelmed .
But after a while , this wears off .
So leave it up to your own imagination .
You look . You open your eyes .
You open your ears . You open your nose .
A grateful world is a world of joyful people .
We couldn &apos;t understand why it mushroomed .
And there have been 15 million candles lit in one decade .
Thank you .
Julian Treasure : Shh ! Sound health in 8 steps
Every part of your body is vibrating at different frequencies .
Your ears are always on -- you have no ear lids .
They work even when you sleep .
Ears are made not for hearing , but for listening .
Here are two of them .
Reductive listening is listening &quot; for . &quot;
Men typically listen reductively .
That &apos;s the way we talk , right guys ?
Women typically listen expansively .
Noise kills 200,000 people a year in Europe .
It &apos;s a really big problem .
It looks a bit like this .
The second problem that comes with headphone abuse is compression .
Listen to this -- this is an uncompressed piece of music .
There is a cost of compression .
You &apos;re having to imagine it .
It &apos;s not good for you in the long run .
We may be raising an entire generation of deaf people .
Now that &apos;s a really serious problem .
Protect your ears in that way .
Silence is beautiful .
The Elizabethans described language as decorated silence .
Have a foreground , a background , all in beautiful proportion .
It &apos;s fun to get into designing with sound .
Sound healing is a wonderful modality .
It &apos;s been around for thousands of years .
I do urge you to explore this .
Devotional music , good -- Mozart , good .
First of all , listen consciously .
Musicians have bigger brains -- it &apos;s true .
You can do this in groups as well .
Protect your ears ? Yes , absolutely .
So I urge you to take that path .
I wish you sound health .
Eben Bayer : Are mushrooms the new plastic ?
Not like that .
And this isn &apos;t just found in packaging .
And that &apos;s not the only place it &apos;s found .
They &apos;re not biologically compatible .
They &apos;re basically fouling up Earth &apos;s respiratory and circulatory systems .
You &apos;ll find it inside of you .
The first is feedstocks .
This is crazy .
But nature provides us with a really good model here .
And this gets us back to the mushrooms .
Because in nature , mushrooms are the recycling system .
In our process , we basically use it as a glue .
But these materials are grown from agricultural byproducts , not petroleum .
We then process these husks with some basic equipment .
It &apos;s a waste product .
Because the manufacturing process is our organism .
And it &apos;s kind of hard to picture how that happens .
So in front of your eyes , this part just self-assembled .
It actually takes a little longer . It takes five days .
But it &apos;s much faster than conventional farming .
The last step , of course , is application .
In this case , we &apos;ve grown a corner block .
So , why mycelium ?
The first reason is local open feedstocks .
Biological yield is really important .
And I think that can be some really good news .
Thank you .
Nirmalya Kumar : India &apos;s invisible innovation
They laughed . They dismissed us .
You must have gotten your education here . &quot;
It could also be novel ways of organizing firms and industries .
Process innovation is different from product innovation .
You can &apos;t be a professor without having been a student .
India has the youngest growing population in the world .
It gives you a sense of the trend .
Ladies and gentlemen , thank you very much .
Jody Williams : A realistic vision for world peace
I &apos;m actually here to make a challenge to people .
I know there have been many challenges made to people .
Peace is not &quot; Kumbaya , my Lord . &quot;
I think of meditation .
This is called human security .
And I &apos;m trying harder and harder .
Mom , I &apos;m really trying .
We need to redefine what makes us secure in this world .
It is not arming our country to the teeth .
I certainly support the START vote .
In global terms , it &apos;s a little bit of money .
It is saving the tigers .
It is stopping the tar sands .
It is all of those things .
It is using our money for all of those things .
It is about action .
I said , &quot; Yes , Your Holiness .
Your robe gives it away . &quot;
I said , &quot; That &apos;s good . That &apos;s good .
We need that in the world .
I don &apos;t follow that , but that &apos;s cool . &quot;
And he says , &quot; But I have become skeptical .
I think what we need is action . &quot;
But I talked to her for a range of issues .
But I don &apos;t believe in hope without endeavor .
Here &apos;s another woman hero of mine .
She says the airports of the world .
Wangari Maathai -- 2004 Peace laureate .
Working for peace is very creative .
It &apos;s hard work every day .
People could not gather without getting busted and taken to jail .
Working together is what changes our world .
I &apos;ll tell you the quick story .
There was a mother and three children .
The children were killed on the spot .
It was Mairead &apos;s sister .
This is Rigoberta Menchu Tum .
She also received the Peace Prize .
She is now running for president .
That &apos;s what I got stuck doing -- the landmine campaign .
They could maybe volunteer that much .
There were others , like myself , who were full-time .
It &apos;s not a dirty word .
It &apos;s hard work every single day .
Thank you .
Toni Griffin : A new vision for rebuilding Detroit
So we began our process in September of 2010 .
They came to Detroit for a better way of life .
Between 1950 and 2000 , the region grows by 30 percent .
Citywide , there are 80,000 vacant homes .
They can also see vacant property .
Citywide , there are about 100,000 vacant parcels .
So the city is 139 square miles .
So it &apos;s a lot of vacancy .
Three key imperatives were really important to our work .
Thank you .
Anil Ananthaswamy : What it takes to do extreme astrophysics
And that feeling hasn &apos;t left me yet .
And physicists came and started using it sometime in the 1980s .
This is one of the largest underground labs in the world .
And where in the world would you find such water ?
Well the Russians have a tank in their own backyard .
This is Lake Baikal .
This is Lake Baikal in the peak of the Siberian winter .
The lake is entirely frozen .
And they have dedicated their lives to it .
It &apos;s very harsh conditions .
They work on a shoestring budget .
But nonetheless , it &apos;s an extraordinary piece of engineering .
These are four 8.2 meter telescopes .
An extraordinary set of telescopes .
Here &apos;s another view of the same .
Finally , I want to take you to Antarctica .
This is cosmology &apos;s final frontier .
And here we are about to board our bus .
And that &apos;s taking us to McMurdo .
And this is the scene that greets you in McMurdo .
It &apos;s an extraordinary place .
And that process takes about two hours .
The fabric alone weighs two tons .
That &apos;s the kind of dedication these people have .
And I would like to share with you a launch .
This is a close-up of the Buddhist monastery .
And both require silence of some sort .
Thank you .
Steven Johnson : Where good ideas come from
This is the Grand Cafe here in Oxford .
Alcohol was the daytime beverage of choice .
You would be sharper and more alert .
And I think I &apos;ve found a few .
We have this very rich vocabulary to describe moments of inspiration .
I mean , this is what is happening inside your brain .
It &apos;s a new configuration that has never formed before .
So , the technology is there .
These are standard in all the industrialized worlds .
They seem to have the expertise to keep cars working .
And this is what they ended up coming with .
It &apos;s called a &quot; neonurture device . &quot;
In the inside , it &apos;s all car parts .
That &apos;s really where innovation happens .
I mean , this is one vision of it .
This is a statue from Oxford .
Darwin is a great example of this .
That &apos;s in his autobiography .
It will be useful in 2020 .
Could you just give me some time to do that ? &quot;
But that &apos;s a key thing .
And of course , this is nerd heaven , right ?
And these two guys are named Guier and Weiffenbach .
We could probably hear it , if we tune in . &quot;
That &apos;s an interesting idea . &quot;
So they made it really easy to find it .
We should record it . &quot;
That &apos;s pretty cool . &quot;
Could you go the other way ?
So they went back , and they thought about it .
And he said , &quot; Oh , that &apos;s great .
Could you work on that problem ? &quot;
And that &apos;s how GPS was born .
That is how innovation happens .
Chance favors the connected mind .
Thank you very much .
Pattie Maes + Pranav Mistry : Meet the SixthSense interaction
But I would say no .
The system tracks the four significant fingers .
The device is completely portable , and can be ...
So one important difference is that it &apos;s totally mobile .
He can ask for additional information .
Reading the newspaper -- it never has to be outdated .
This is a more controversial one .
And his girlfriend is probably not very happy about him either .
Thank you .
Harald Haas : Wireless data from every light bulb
And these are base stations .
These are cellular mobile phones .
And wireless communications has become a utility like electricity and water .
And one of the issues is capacity .
And radio waves are limited .
And we are simply running out of spectrum .
There &apos;s another problem .
That is efficiency .
And that creates a big problem .
Then there &apos;s another issue that you &apos;re all aware of .
You have to switch off your mobile phone during flights .
In hospitals , they are security issues .
And security is another issue .
These radio waves penetrate through walls .
So these are the main four issues .
And light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum .
X-rays , useful when you go to hospitals .
Then there &apos;s ultraviolet light .
So it &apos;s inherently safe to use .
And guess what ?
14 billion is the number of light bulbs installed already .
So we have the infrastructure there .
Look at the ceiling , you see all these light bulbs .
Go to the main floor , you see these light bulbs .
Can we use them for communications ?
Yes .
What do we need to do ?
An LED is a semiconductor . It &apos;s an electronic device .
And it has a very nice acute property .
So let &apos;s show how we do that .
Not usable for a YouTube video .
But not only that .
What we &apos;ve done is we have also developed a demonstrator .
And what we have here is no ordinary desk lamp .
And then what we have here is a little hole .
And the light goes through that hole .
There &apos;s a receiver .
So what happens when I switch on that light ?
Put your book beneath it and you can read .
It &apos;s illuminating the space .
You &apos;re critical .
You think , &quot; Ha , ha , ha .
But let me do this .
Once again .
Still don &apos;t believe ?
You don &apos;t notice with your human eye .
And the answer is yes .
So I &apos;ve mentioned to you the four challenges .
That &apos;s aside .
And then I &apos;ve mentioned the availability .
You need to see what to do .
You have lights in an aircraft .
So it &apos;s everywhere in a day there is light .
Look around . Everywhere . Look at your smart phone .
It has a flashlight , an LED flashlight .
These are potential sources for high-speed data transmission .
And then there &apos;s security .
And there &apos;s only data where there is light .
So the data goes in that direction , not there anymore .
But I can give you a few examples .
Well you may see the impact already now .
This is a remote operated vehicle beneath the ocean .
And they use light to illuminate space down there .
Traffic lights can communicate to the car and so on .
And every street lamp could be a free access point .
We call it , in fact , a Li-Fi , light-fidelity .
And then we have these aircraft cabins .
Thank you .
Daniel Kraft : A better way to harvest bone marrow
So actually how do we harvest this bone marrow ?
About 200 times usually .
And there is probably a better way to do this .
This is it .
Our standard see-through patient .
We can do multiple passes through that same entry .
No robots required .
And played around with this a little bit .
And our team members developed this technology .
And eventually we got two large animals , and pig studies .
This device was just FDA approved in the last year .
This was done under local anesthesia , as an outpatient .
You all know about embryonic stem cells .
Thanks .
Marco Tempest : A cyber-magic card trick like no other
You &apos;ve probably all heard of Google &apos;s Project Glass .
So these are my illusion glasses .
They &apos;re a little bigger . They &apos;re a prototype .
Let me show you what I mean .
All right . Very significant mark .
Voice : System ready . Acquiring image .
There are 13 cards in each suit .
MT : There are two colors in a deck of cards .
Make a wish .
Wake up .
Joker : Whoa.MT : Are you ready for your party piece ?
Joker : Presenting my pogo stick.MT : Ah . Watch out .
Joker : Whoa , whoa , whoa , oh !
I &apos;m performing for you .
Whoa .
Well , to this , I just say , no no .
Actually , in German , it &apos;s nein nein .
Voice : Why not ? That &apos;s a very good hand .
The odds of getting it are 4,165 to one .
Digital MT : This is without a question the real thing .
MT : Bye bye .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Nancy Lublin : Texting that saves lives
I think it might be a lifeline .
I can help you with those later .
It might be the only way to communicate with your kids .
And the secret is she opens every single one .
Texting has a 100 percent open rate .
Now the parents are really alarmed .
I promise she read that text .
And this isn &apos;t some suburban iPhone-using teen phenomenon .
Texting actually overindexes for minority and urban youth .
We &apos;re finding it 11 times more powerful than email .
We &apos;ve also found an unintended consequence .
We &apos;ve been getting text messages back like these .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to go to school today .
The boys call me faggot . &quot;
But I just started again an hour ago . &quot;
Or , &quot; He won &apos;t stop raping me .
He told me not to tell anyone .
It &apos;s my dad . Are you there ? &quot;
That last one &apos;s an actual text message that we received .
And yeah , we &apos;re there .
I will not forget the day we got that text message .
Because this isn &apos;t what we do .
We do social change .
It &apos;s fast , it &apos;s pretty private .
It &apos;s real time .
We can help millions of teens with counseling and referrals .
That &apos;s great .
But the thing that really makes this awesome is the data .
I want to prevent this shit from happening .
So think about a cop .
There &apos;s something in New York City .
And then they started crime mapping .
So think about the data from a crisis text line .
Or maybe there &apos;s some anecdotal evidence .
Imagine having real time data on every one of those issues .
You could inform legislation .
You could inform school policy .
What &apos;s going on in your school ? &quot;
Thank you .
Phil Hansen : Embrace the shake
This was the destruction of my dream of becoming an artist .
I was making all these scribble pictures .
I actually didn &apos;t even have a regular pair of scissors .
Embrace the shake .
So the end image was never visible as a physical whole .
It was destroyed before it ever existed .
It did not happen overnight .
And what if I didn &apos;t embrace the shake ?
Thank you .
Kelly McGonigal : How to make stress your friend
Anyone ?
How about a moderate amount of stress ?
Who has experienced a lot of stress ?
Yeah . Me too .
But that is not my confession .
Basically , I &apos;ve turned stress into the enemy .
Okay . Some bad news first .
That is over 20,000 deaths a year .
You can see why this study freaked me out .
It &apos;s called the social stress test .
Now we &apos;re going to all do this together .
It &apos;s going to be fun .
For me .
as fast as you can , starting with 996 .
Go !
Audience : Go faster . Faster please .
You &apos;re going too slow .
Stop . Stop , stop , stop .
That guy made a mistake .
We are going to have to start all over again .
You &apos;re not very good at this , are you ?
Okay , so you get the idea .
That pounding heart is preparing you for action .
If you &apos;re breathing faster , it &apos;s no problem .
It &apos;s getting more oxygen to your brain .
So my goal as a health psychologist has changed .
I no longer want to get rid of your stress .
I want to make you better at stress .
And we just did a little intervention .
Oxytocin is a neuro-hormone .
It fine-tunes your brain &apos;s social instincts .
It primes you to do things that strengthen close relationships .
Oxytocin makes you crave physical contact with your friends and family .
It enhances your empathy .
But here &apos;s what most people don &apos;t understand about oxytocin .
It &apos;s a stress hormone .
Well , oxytocin doesn &apos;t only act on your brain .
It &apos;s a natural anti-inflammatory .
It also helps your blood vessels stay relaxed during stress .
I want to finish by telling you about one more study .
Caring created resilience .
Stress gives us access to our hearts .
Thank you .
This is kind of amazing , what you &apos;re telling us .
Rory Sutherland : Perspective is everything
What you have here is an electronic cigarette .
It &apos;s really , really tiring .
So the power of reframing things cannot be overstated .
And reality isn &apos;t a particularly good guide to human happiness .
And when it nuzzles the button , the electric shock stops .
The other dog doesn &apos;t have the button .
Generally the first dog can be relatively content .
The second dog lapses into complete depression .
It &apos;s an interesting question .
Because they are actually the same thing .
I think psychological value is great to be absolutely honest .
I think that &apos;s true actually .
We didn &apos;t have a framework .
You know my example of the Eurostar .
And I think that &apos;s probably right .
But this does not apply the other way around .
Red traffic lights have a countdown delay .
It &apos;s proven to reduce the accident rate in experiments .
Which isn &apos;t a great idea .
The Koreans , very assiduously , did test both .
It &apos;s an innate thing called goal dilution .
Ayelet Fishbach has written a paper about this .
So we walk out of the shops with one of each .
Don &apos;t give them 24 white pills .
It &apos;s called chunking .
This is a toll crossing in Britain .
Quite often queues happen at the tolls .
Sometimes you get very , very severe queues .
Time means more to some people than others .
And I think understanding that could revolutionize tax policy .
It could revolutionize the public services .
It could really change things quite significantly .
Here &apos;s a guy you all need to study .
And so they &apos;re predominantly interested in psychology .
I think they &apos;re right .
Von Mises completely rejected this distinction .
And he used this following analogy .
Try this quick thought experiment .
And it &apos;s vital we understand this .
The effort to do that almost broke the organization .
That &apos;s pretty good .
And so perception actually is leaky in any case .
Thank you very much .
Elif Shafak : The politics of fiction
I &apos;m a storyteller .
I was born in Strasbourg , France to Turkish parents .
It will dry up inside .
We all do .
We &apos;re born into a certain family , nation , class .
I started writing fiction at the age of eight .
And thus began my life-long passion for writing fiction .
Now one other thing happened around this same time .
My mother became a diplomat .
I also had my first taste of cultural stereotypes there .
I was in Istanbul when the earthquake hit in 1999 .
I started writing fiction in English .
So I feel connected to each language in a different way .
And that gap is very intimidating .
And because God loves her , I did get married .
But instead of settling down , I went to Arizona .
I asked him what he meant by that .
And I also understood that I would keep disappointing him .
He wanted to see the manifestation of my identity .
It was only because of our passports .
A function is attributed to fiction .
It comes from everywhere .
My micro story became a macro issue when I was prosecuted .
It was just a story .
And only the latter is an artist &apos;s responsibility . &quot;
Identity politics divides us . Fiction connects .
One is interested in sweeping generalizations .
The other , in nuances .
One draws boundaries .
The other recognizes no frontiers .
Identity politics is made of solid bricks .
Fiction is flowing water .
Today , stories continue to transcend borders .
Literature has to take us beyond .
But I &apos;m also aware of the danger of fetishizing them .
Like that , my fiction as well .
It &apos;s between buildings .
I &apos;m intrigued by this concept .
We usually distrust those areas that fall in between things .
When I write fiction I cherish elusiveness and changeability .
I like not knowing what will happen 10 pages later .
I like it when my characters surprise me .
I think it was a wonderful paradigm shift .
Perhaps that &apos;s not the right way to start at all .
Thank you .
Naturally 7 : A full-band beatbox
We &apos;re ready to fly ! Thank you very much .
Chris Bliss : Comedy is translation
And it &apos;s a charming read .
So no ego problems .
I don &apos;t need a husband who wants to be . &quot;
And that &apos;s when I discovered comedy .
They were lifted verbatim from Palin &apos;s own remarks .
Here was a Palin impersonator quoting Palin word for word .
The description perfectly captured Edwards &apos; personal vanity .
And guess what ?
His intent is to be funny .
Flight-or-fight releases adrenalin , which throws our walls up sky-high .
Now let me give you an example from my act .
Three things I &apos;ve tried to avoid my entire life .
Have at it you radical bastards . The field is yours .
Why is this remotely controversial ?
You have given birth to an abomination .
Remove it from your household .
Economy of language is another real strong suit of great comedy .
That &apos;s an entire childhood in three words .
People can &apos;t wait to pass along that new great joke .
And this isn &apos;t some new phenomenon of our wired world .
First there were drums and then knock-knock jokes .
And he used to be the USA Today Monday morning guy .
So we started talking about climate change .
You &apos;ve got to love that idea .
And this cartoon hit the bull &apos;s eye .
And it didn &apos;t stop there .
That is a lot of punch for 14 words .
Thank you .
Sheikha Al Mayassa : Globalizing the local , localizing the global
Qatar is no exception to the region .
It &apos;s a very young nation led by young people .
Her answer was quite the contrary .
Not that you do ; I &apos;m just saying .
We know that modernization is happening .
And yes , Qatar wants to be a modern nation .
It &apos;s important for us to grow organically .
And we continuously make the conscious decision to reach that balance .
And therefore tradition becomes more important , not less important .
I &apos;m a representation of that phenomenon .
How does that impact our desert culture ?
And guess what ?
No , I don &apos;t think so .
Art becomes a very important part of our national identity .
You know , art and culture is big business .
Ask me .
Ask the chairpersons and CEOs of Sotheby &apos;s and Christie &apos;s .
Ask Charles Saatchi about great art .
They make a lot of money .
Why else do Greeks demand the return of the Elgin Marbles ?
She does that through important visual forms of photography and film .
Our mission is of cultural integration and independence .
We don &apos;t want their collections .
For me it was a new discovery .
Now visual expression is just one form of culture integration .
Last year we didn &apos;t have one Qatari woman filmmaker .
And this is one of our filmmakers &apos; products .
Who are you playing ?
Girl : Uncle Khaled . Here , put on the headscarf .
Khaled : Why would I want to put it on ?
Girl : Do as you &apos;re told , young girl .
Boy : No , you play mom and I play dad .
Play by yourself then .
Girl : Women ! One word and they get upset .
Useless .
Thank you . Thank you !
It attracted 42,000 people , and we showcased 51 films .
It &apos;s important for two things .
Culture &apos;s a very important tool to bring people together .
We should not underestimate it .
This is a very interesting journey .
Familiarity destroys and trumps fear . Try it .
Ladies and gentlemen , thank you very much . Shokran .
Christopher &quot; moot &quot; Poole &quot; : The case for anonymity online
Tom Green : That &apos;s a 4chan thing .
It &apos;s a video game move from &quot; Star Fox . &quot;
&quot; Star Fox 20 &quot; ?
And it was a Japanese forum and imageboard .
And we &apos;ve gone from one board to 48 boards .
This is what it looks like .
And Rick Astley &apos;s kind of rebirth these past two years ...
There are thousands of memes that come out of the site .
So does a site like this have rules ?
Rule one is you don &apos;t talk about / b / .
Two is you do not talk about / b / .
And I will spare you that slide .
I assure you , it is very true .
It is where a third of all the traffic is going .
So they broke that poll .
And I ended up on top .
I ended up at this really fancy party .
But that &apos;s not what &apos;s interesting about this .
They are still protesting .
Dusty is the name that we &apos;ve given to this cat .
They matched , they found his MySpace .
As I said , it &apos;s raw , it &apos;s unfiltered .
They &apos;re endangered because we &apos;re moving towards social networking .
We &apos;re moving towards persistent identity .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Got a couple questions for you .
Don &apos;t tell .
You &apos;ve had to wrestle with issues like child pornography .
CP : Yes and no .
There are plenty of downsides .
And saying whatever you like , I think , is powerful .
Doing whatever you like is now crossing a line .
But I think it &apos;s important to have these places .
CP : There are , certainly .
CP : Yeah , I posted a thread on Sunday .
And within 24 hours , it had over 12,000 responses .
Love and peace were mentioned .
CP : Cats and dogs were mentioned too .
And that content is all off the board now .
Okay , well .
What &apos;s the commercial picture here ?
The site has adult content on it .
But you still live at home , right ?
CP : I actually moved out recently .
That &apos;s very cool .
The content is not dinner table conversation in the least .
CP : That &apos;s a good question .
Matt Ridley : When ideas have sex
The population explosion was unstoppable .
Global famine was inevitable .
The acid rain was falling on the forests .
The desert was advancing by a mile or two a year .
Lifespan is up by 30 percent in my lifetime .
Child mortality is down by two-thirds .
Per-capita food production is up by a third .
And all this at a time when the population has doubled .
How did we achieve that ?
These are both real objects .
The other is obviously a computer mouse .
Homo erectus made the same tool for 30,000 generations .
There was no progress , no innovation .
It &apos;s an extraordinary phenomenon , but it &apos;s true .
Whereas the object on the right is obsolete after five years .
They &apos;ve all been combined together in this technology .
They &apos;ve come together .
How does evolution do cumulative , combinatorial things ?
Well , it uses sexual reproduction .
One goes extinct for the other to survive .
It &apos;s not confined to its own lineage .
It &apos;s a unique human feature .
No other animal does it .
You can have culture without exchange .
You can have , as it were , asexual culture .
Chimpanzee troops have different cultures in different troops .
There &apos;s no exchange of ideas between them .
And why does exchange raise living standards ?
Well , the answer came from David Ricardo in 1817 .
So Oz is better at both spears and axes than Adam .
He doesn &apos;t need Adam .
He can make his own spears and axes .
So the gains from trade are only going to grow .
Adam and Oz both saved an hour of time .
And the answer is about half a second .
The stone axe was made by someone for himself .
It was self-sufficiency .
We call that poverty these days .
How many other people ?
Tens ? Hundreds ? Thousands ?
You know , I think it &apos;s probably millions .
And that &apos;s the way society works .
That &apos;s what we &apos;ve achieved as a species .
Louis XIV had a lot of people working for him .
He had 498 people to prepare his dinner every night .
There &apos;s no working for each other across the colonies .
That is to say , they specialize with respect to reproduction .
The queen does it all .
In our species , we don &apos;t like doing that .
So when did this habit start ?
But I &apos;ve got no evidence for that .
They were a highly cooperative species .
They were a highly intelligent species .
They were imaginative . They buried their dead .
And so it looks like they probably had linguistic skills .
They were brilliant people . I &apos;m not dissing the Neanderthals .
But there &apos;s no evidence of a sexual division of labor .
There &apos;s no evidence of gathering behavior by females .
It looks like the females were cooperative hunters with the men .
They &apos;re always made from local chert .
Trade is 10 times as old as farming .
And that &apos;s evidence that people have started exchanging between groups .
And that will have led to specialization .
An example is Tasmania .
The Tasmanians were isolated .
But who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
Nobody , literally nobody .
I mean this quite seriously .
The president of the computer mouse company doesn &apos;t know .
He just knows how to run a company .
It &apos;s not the same with language .
It &apos;s completely irrelevant .
So we &apos;ve created something called the collective brain .
We &apos;re just the nodes in the network .
We &apos;re the neurons in this brain .
However , bad things happen .
Thank you .
Honor Harger : A history of the universe in sound
Space , we all know what it looks like .
And indeed , most people associate space with silence .
This is the planet Jupiter .
Well the answer is the science of radio astronomy .
So Thomas Watson wasn &apos;t listening to us .
We didn &apos;t have the technology to transmit .
So what were these strange noises ?
Radio could carry sound without wires .
They turned out to be lightning or sources of electrical power .
Let &apos;s jump ahead again .
It &apos;s 1964 , and we &apos;re back at Bell Labs .
They were really listening to the galaxy in high fidelity .
There was a glitch in their soundtrack .
A mysterious persistent noise was disrupting their research .
There were pigeons roosting in the dish .
But the noise didn &apos;t disappear .
Thanks .
Stewart Brand : The dawn of de-extinction . Are you ready ?
Now , extinction is a different kind of death .
It &apos;s bigger .
Suddenly it wasn &apos;t here at all .
What happened ?
Well , commercial hunting happened .
It was the cheapest source of protein in America .
There &apos;s an upside to the story .
But a lot of other animals weren &apos;t saved .
The Carolina parakeet was a parrot that lit up backyards everywhere .
It was hunted to death for its feathers .
It happened to lots of mammals .
Another keystone species is a famous animal called the European aurochs .
There was sort of a movie made about it recently .
And the aurochs was like the bison .
The extinctions still go on .
There &apos;s an ibex in Spain called the bucardo .
It went extinct in 2000 .
A little bit of film was shot .
Sorrow , anger , mourning .
Don &apos;t mourn . Organize .
George Church thinks you can .
It &apos;s kind of like an evolution machine .
The passenger pigeon has 1.3 billion base pairs in its genome .
It &apos;s called an allele .
Well that &apos;s what happens in normal hybridization anyway .
Genetically , the band-tailed pigeon already is mostly living passenger pigeon .
There &apos;s just some bits that are band-tailed pigeon .
Now , there &apos;s work to do .
You have to figure out exactly what genes matter .
Add them all up and the result won &apos;t be perfect .
So this meeting in Boston led to three things .
We hired him full-time .
De-extinction falls in that category .
Some of these conservation biologists are pretty radical .
Another amazing story came from Alberto Fernández-Arias .
Alberto worked with the bucardo in Spain .
It was the first de-extinction in history .
It was short-lived .
Sometimes interspecies clones have respiration problems .
Cryopreservation pioneer of great depth is Oliver Ryder .
Since it &apos;s so pluripotent , it can become germ plasm .
Real falcons out of slightly doctored chickens .
Ben Novak was the youngest scientist at the meeting .
He showed how all of this can be put together .
So what do you do about that ?
Here &apos;s a couple related examples .
The California condor was down to 22 birds in 1987 .
Everybody thought is was finished .
That technology will be used on de-extincted animals .
Another success story is the mountain gorilla in Central Africa .
In 1981 , Dian Fossey was sure they were going extinct .
There were just 254 left .
That &apos;s how comfortable these wild gorillas are with visitors .
There &apos;s no breeding pairs left .
A bit of cloning , you can get them back .
So where do we go from here ?
These have been private meetings so far .
I think it &apos;s time for the subject to go public .
What do people think about it ?
You know , do you want extinct species back ?
Do you want extinct species back ?
Tinker Bell is going to come fluttering down .
What are they concerned about ?
We &apos;re also going to push ahead with the passenger pigeon .
Thank you .
Thank you .
I &apos;ve got a question .
So , this is an emotional topic . Some people stand .
There &apos;s going to be unintended consequences .
We will get woolly mammoths back .
Thank you so much for presenting . SB : Thank you .
Thank you .
Tan Le : A headset that reads your brainwaves
This actually forms a large part of our decision-making process .
There is no longer any consistency in the surface signals .
The second challenge is the actual device for observing brainwaves .
Now on to the detection algorithms .
Evan . Okay .
He just hangs out . He &apos;s relaxed .
Evan Grant : Let &apos;s do &quot; pull . &quot;
So : one , two , three , go .
Okay .
So once we accept this , the cube is live .
Ah , good job !
That &apos;s really amazing .
This is &quot; disappear . &quot;
Okay . Let &apos;s try that .
Oh , my goodness . He &apos;s just too good .
Let &apos;s try that again .
EG : Losing concentration .
Good job . Good job .
Now blink right to go right .
Now blink left to turn back left .
Now smile to go straight .
TL : We really -- Thank you .
Madeleine Albright : On being a woman and a diplomat
Pat Mitchell : What is the story of this pin ?
Madeleine Albright : This is &quot; Breaking the Glass Ceiling . &quot;
PM : Oh .
That was well chosen , I would say , for TEDWomen .
I &apos;ll tell you what happened .
And so I happened to have a snake pin .
So I wore it when we talked about Iraq .
And then I thought , well this is fun .
So that &apos;s how it all started .
PM : So how large is the collection ?
Pretty big .
It &apos;s now traveling .
PM : So is this a good idea .
But people did pay attention to what clothes I had .
Go out and look like a diplomat . &quot;
and so how did you handle that ?
So it evolved .
But basically I love being a woman .
and &quot; will I really say something intelligent ? &quot;
Only girls are Secretary of State . &quot;
PM : Because in her lifetime -- That would be so .
PM : What a change that is .
Where are we ?
From some people .
I think that they thought that it was a soft issue .
The women in Bosnia were being raped .
Now there are 192 .
PM : Is that &quot; Girl 7 ? &quot; Girl 7 .
And we lobbied on behalf of women &apos;s issues .
If you think that , you &apos;ve forgotten high school .
And it was really terrific .
Because one of the things I think you &apos;ll understand .
And so then Tarja was sitting across the table from me .
More women &apos;s voices at the table ?
More men who believe that the balance is best ?
Thank you for joining us today .
Thank you all . Thanks Pat .
Eric Giler : A demo of wireless electricity
I mean , think about how much we love this .
The other thing is , we love batteries .
So I thought I &apos;d better look it up first .
Wires suck , they really do .
The other thing is , batteries suck too .
And they really , really do .
Do you ever wonder what happens to this stuff ?
40 billion of these things built .
This is what happens .
Think about that .
And nature really does abhor a vacuum .
But inside a standard transformer are two coils of wire .
So how does it work ?
Number one question I get asked .
I mean , people are worried about cellphones being safe .
You know . What about safety ?
It doesn &apos;t radiate .
We live in a magnetic field .
And it &apos;s virtually impossible in nature to make that happen .
Mobile electronics .
Home electronics .
There are industrial applications .
And then finally , electric vehicles .
These electric cars are beautiful .
But who is going to want to plug them in ?
And it actually causes your car to charge safely and efficiently .
Credit cards , robot vacuum cleaners .
You &apos;ve got a coil .
We put one on the back of the television set .
It will cause one to get created on the other side .
So , I &apos;ll plug that in .
It creates a magnetic field here .
It causes one to be created out here .
This is a commercially -- available color television set .
How many people want to hang them on the wall ?
Imagine if you can get rid of it .
The other thing I wanted to talk about was safety .
So , there is nothing going on . I &apos;m okay .
So , I wanted to show you something .
We &apos;re an equal opportunity designer of this sort of thing .
This a Google G1 .
It runs the Android operating system .
I think I heard somebody talk about that before .
It &apos;s odd . It has a battery .
you &apos;re looking at a cellphone powered completely wirelessly .
And I know some of you are Apple aficionados .
And Nokia as well .
But they typically use it to light up the screen .
You never have to worry about plugging these things in again .
And think of what that would do for you .
So , thank you very much .
Rob Dunbar : Discovering ancient climates in oceans and ice
We &apos;ll look at sea level rise .
We &apos;ll look at ocean warming .
What frightens you ? &quot;
for me , it &apos;s ocean acidification .
And this has come onto the stage pretty recently .
So I will spend a little time at the end .
It really wasn &apos;t on the radar screen .
You know , they were marginalized in the negotiation room .
One of the problems is coming up with the right target .
It &apos;s not clear what the target should be .
But there &apos;s not a lot of science behind that number .
Should it be 450 ? Should it be 400 ?
There &apos;s not a lot of science behind that one either .
Now , why is this so complicated ?
There &apos;s all kinds of natural causes of climate change .
There &apos;s air-sea interactions .
Volcanoes eject aerosols into the atmosphere .
That changes our climate .
The ocean contains most of the exchangeable heat on the planet .
And we know the solar output &apos;s not constant through time .
So those are all natural causes of climate change .
Now , we have many ways to study natural variability .
I &apos;ll show you a few examples of this now .
It &apos;s a scientific drilling vessel .
And so that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done with this ship .
This was -- this is south of the Antarctic Circle .
It looks downright tropical there .
Most of the time it looked like this .
We had a waves up to 50 ft .
This was led by Ross Powell and Tim Naish .
It &apos;s the ANDRILL project .
And we drilled in the Ross Sea .
That &apos;s the Ross Sea Ice Shelf on the right there .
This is the part of Antarctica that we worry about .
When that ice melts , sea level rises by six meters .
Here &apos;s the cartoon on the left there .
So it &apos;s the deepest geological bore hole ever drilled .
It took about 10 years to put this project together .
And here &apos;s what we found .
That &apos;s the kind of material in the deep sea .
So we know there &apos;s an ice shelf overhead .
And that alternates with a sediment that looks like this .
This is absolutely beautiful stuff .
And this is in the past four million years .
This was completely unexpected .
Nobody imagined that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet was this dynamic .
What caused it ?
that ice sheet became very dynamic and was very easily melted .
And you know what ?
And it could be larger than that .
Okay , the second story takes place here in Galapagos .
This is from Champion Island .
It &apos;s about a meter tall Pavona clavus colony .
And it &apos;s covered with algae . That &apos;s what happens .
Then there was similar mortality in &apos; 97- &apos; 98 .
We saw no other mass mortality events .
So these events in our recent past really are unique .
Here &apos;s how we sample the corals .
This is actually Easter Island . Look at this monster .
This coral is eight meters tall , right .
And it been growing for about 600 years .
So we have a diamond drill .
The core comes up as these cylindrical tubes of limestone .
So we &apos;ve done that all over the Eastern Pacific .
I &apos;ll take you back here to the Galapagos Islands .
Imagine that .
Each one of those is a year .
And we just count on down to the bottom .
Then their other attribute is that they have this great chemistry .
Their ratio tells us the water temperature .
The coral can take us back hundreds and thousands of years .
Here &apos;s a synthetic diagram .
There &apos;s a whole family of curves here .
We do similar things with ice cores .
We work with tree rings .
This is as messy as it gets .
You can see there &apos;s some signals there .
Some of the records show lower temperatures than others .
Some of them show greater variability .
But they all tell us what the natural variability is .
It was cooling down until about 1900 or so .
And there &apos;s the temperature up there in 2009 .
So I &apos;ll close with a short discussion of ocean acidification .
So , you cannot argue with that .
It has many consequences .
There &apos;s consequences for carbonate organisms .
The main framework material of coral reefs is calcium carbonate .
That material is more soluble in acidic fluid .
But it &apos;s not just the carbonate producers that are affected .
Thank you very much .
John Underkoffler : Pointing to the future of UI
The interface is the OS .
There were no graphics routines . There were no mouse drivers .
So it was a necessity .
Same thing for processor speeds .
So we &apos;ve got that incredible ramp-up .
So we &apos;ve forgotten to invent new interfaces .
So what happens next ? Where do we go from there ?
They don &apos;t understand real world space .
So what happens if you start to explain space to them ?
One thing you might get is something like the Luminous Room .
That &apos;s a digital storage in a physical container .
Has to come back out , whatever you put in .
So you &apos;ve got an interface that has no interface .
Here , the real world merges with the simulation .
And we make the machine meet them half way .
It projects down digital shadows , as you see here .
That &apos;s 8 a.m. shadows .
They get a little shorter at 9 a.m.
There you are , swinging the sun around .
Short shadows at noon and so forth .
And we built up a series of tools like this .
Are you blinding passers by and motorists on the freeways ?
This work is 15 years old .
And the result is sort of gratifyingly perpetual .
So here we have a bunch of stuff , some images .
And it &apos;s fun to fly through Mr. Beckett &apos;s eye .
And you can come back out through the scary orangutan .
And that &apos;s all well and good .
Let &apos;s do something a little more difficult .
Here , we have a whole bunch of disparate images .
We can fly around them .
So navigation is a fundamental issue .
You have to be able to navigate in 3D .
Now we can distribute this stuff in many different ways .
We can organize it this way .
Let &apos;s just come down a bit and fly around .
So that &apos;s a different way to look at stuff .
Here are some selection planes .
So , from there to the world of real work .
There &apos;re a lot of elements .
So here &apos;s a familiar place .
And we &apos;ll bring this back here for a second .
Maybe select a little bit of that .
And bring out this graph .
These are logistics elements that are scattered across the United States .
Well , that doesn &apos;t really cut it anymore .
And we might want to look at these various images .
We might want to ask for some help .
These are unrelated machines , right ?
So the computation is space soluble and network soluble .
So let me get some of these out of the way .
Kevin , can you help ?
All right .
So we have a large number of movies stuck inside here .
And let &apos;s just pick out a few elements .
We can zip through them as a possibility .
We may need more than one .
Yeah , let &apos;s take that one .
And , as well , as of efficacy , agency .
So I will leave you with that . Thank you .
That &apos;s our goal entirely .
I mean it &apos;s been 25 years .
Can there really be only one interface ? There can &apos;t .
You know , how can it work ?
It &apos;ll be built into architecture .
The gloves go away in a matter of months or years .
So this is the inevitability about it .
Well that &apos;s cool .
And I understand what you &apos;re asking .
John , thank you for making science-fiction real .
JU : It &apos;s been a great pleasure .
Thank you to you all .
Caroline Casey : Looking past limits
Do you know what I wanted to be ?
I wanted to be a biker chick .
Because big sisters are always supposed to support their little sisters .
So I used to get my eyes tested just for fun .
I am , and have been since birth , legally blind .
And what the hell does that mean to you ?
I might buy some more time .
Hey .
See this hand ?
Beyond this hand is a world of Vaseline .
And every woman , you are so beautiful .
No special needs schools .
No labels .
No limitations .
My ability and my potential .
And they decided to tell me that I could see .
But very quickly I recovered . It was like that .
And I believed I could do it .
So I rammed through life as only a Casey can do .
And I was an archeologist , and then I broke things .
And then I went to business school .
And you know , disabled people are hugely educated .
And they didn &apos;t even know .
And it &apos;s extraordinary how far belief can take you .
Wonderfully , my eyes decided , enough .
And temporarily , very unexpectedly , they dropped .
And two years in , I really could see very little .
I was 28 years old .
And I simply said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry .
I can &apos;t see , and I need help . &quot;
Asking for help can be incredibly difficult .
And it &apos;s frightening , isn &apos;t it ?
But all that belief had fueled me so long .
Can I tell you , airports are a disaster .
Oh , for the love of God .
And please , any designers out there ?
I always end up in the gents &apos; toilets .
And there &apos;s nothing wrong with my sense of smell .
It &apos;s such a small thing , right ?
But before I got to him , I was so lost .
I had no idea who I was anymore .
God no , it was therapy .
Why are you fighting so hard not to be yourself ?
And do you love what you do , Caroline ? &quot;
To leave would be failure .
And he said , &quot; Do you love it ? &quot;
I couldn &apos;t even speak I was so choked up .
I just was so -- how do I tell him ?
Hardly appropriate at this moment in time .
He thought I was mad enough anyway .
And that door closed .
And my chest ached .
But I did know the game was up .
Really not a very sensible thing to do .
And I went on a run that I know so well .
I always run it perfectly fine .
And there was a rock that I always missed .
And I &apos;d never fallen on it , never .
And I didn &apos;t know what to do .
Because who am I going to be ?
What am I going to be ? &quot;
I had lost my belief .
Look where my belief had brought me to .
I was crumpled .
Do something different . What do you want to be ?
Do something different . What do you want to be ? &quot;
And really slowly , slowly , slowly , it happened .
And it did happen this way .
You don &apos;t get more different than that . &quot;
And nobody can tell me no .
Yes , you can say I can &apos;t be an archeologist .
I know how to be Mowgli .
I &apos;m going to be an elephant handler . &quot;
From global management consultant to elephant handler .
But I knew I would .
And together we would trek a thousand kilometers across India .
But you know , I was believing in the wrong thing .
Six thousand people got to see because of that .
I chucked in my job at Accenture .
It was extraordinary .
That &apos;s what I wanted to do .
It just seemed that it was possible .
Even though I present confident , I was scared .
He said , &quot; Be you . &quot;
And so here I am .
This is me , all of me .
Being absolutely true to yourself is freedom .
And I never needed eyes to see -- never .
I simply needed vision and belief .
I no longer want anybody to be invisible .
We all have to be included .
And stop with the labels , the limiting .
Losing of labels , because we are not jam jars .
We are extraordinary , different , wonderful people .
Thank you .
Sam Richards : A radical experiment in empathy
My students often ask me , &quot; What is sociology ? &quot;
How can I understand those invisible forces ? &quot;
And I say , &quot; Empathy .
Start with empathy .
It all begins with empathy .
Here , I &apos;ll give you an example .
And they got fabulously wealthy in doing so .
And they built beautiful cities all powered on that coal .
This is what I saw .
And then I asked myself the question .
Does this sound familiar ?
And back in China , what do they say in China ?
You can &apos;t expect that . &quot;
And we fight back , and it gets really ugly .
And the Chinese respond in a very ugly way .
And just imagine what you would feel .
And you just feel the anger and you feel the fear .
If you can , that &apos;s empathy -- that &apos;s empathy .
And you &apos;ve got to feel that .
Okay , so that &apos;s the warm up .
That &apos;s the warm up .
Now we &apos;re going to have the real radical experiment .
You want your kids to have a better life .
So you have a sense of what the Americans are thinking .
But really , you just want a better life for yourself .
That &apos;s what you want .
You &apos;re Arab Muslim living in Iraq .
You want a better life for yourself .
So here , let me help you .
It &apos;s because somebody else has a design for your resource .
It &apos;s your resource ; it &apos;s not somebody else &apos;s .
It &apos;s your land ; it &apos;s your resource .
Somebody else has a design for it .
And you know why they have a design ?
You know why they have their eyes set on it ?
And what else do you think about these people ?
The Americans , they &apos;re rich .
And back home , what do you see ?
Poverty , despair , struggle .
Look , you don &apos;t live in a wealthy country .
This is Iraq .
This is what you see .
You see people struggling to get by .
And you feel something about this .
And you feel it ; you see it every day .
It &apos;s part of your life .
And you talk about it with your friends .
You read about it .
That &apos;s odd .
You can &apos;t help but think that .
You talk about it .
It &apos;s in the forefront of your mind always .
You say , &quot; How is that possible ? &quot;
Not a single person in your country has not been touched .
But there &apos;s something else .
And what do you see ? They &apos;re Christians .
They &apos;re Christians .
Why ?
You don &apos;t want Americans to die . Protect our troops .
And you feel something about that -- of course you do .
And they do wonderful things .
You read about it , you hear about it .
They don &apos;t know anything about him , but you do .
You pass it around . You pass his words around .
I mean this is serious . You &apos;re afraid .
Whatever . I don &apos;t know . &quot;
You know what it means .
It &apos;s a holy war against Muslims .
Look , invade , subdue them , take their resources .
If they won &apos;t submit , kill them .
That &apos;s what this is about .
This is frightening .
You feel frightened . Of course you feel frightened .
And the Americans : &quot; Ah , he &apos;s a knucklehead .
They laugh him off . You don &apos;t laugh him off .
&quot; He wants to burn Korans , our holy book .
These Christians , who are these Christians ?
Of course you &apos;re going to think this .
You &apos;ve got to see this -- Bible Boot Camp .
These Christians are nuts .
They &apos;re training their little kids to be soldiers for Jesus .
And go to the website .
It says &quot; U.S. Army &quot; right on it .
And you &apos;re reading this website .
You don &apos;t know that .
For you , this is like all Christians .
It &apos;s all over the Web , Bible Boot Camp .
Isn &apos;t that interesting .
And it scares you , and it frightens you .
So these guys , you see them .
They &apos;re my students , my friends .
That &apos;s what they are to you .
So here .
Of course , you got it wrong .
You &apos;re generalizing . It &apos;s wrong .
You don &apos;t understand the Americans .
It &apos;s not a Christian invasion .
You have it wrong . You &apos;ve missed it .
Of course you don &apos;t . Very few people do .
But some of you do .
And this is a perspective .
So everyone &apos;s back in the room , okay .
Now here comes the radical experiment .
So we &apos;re all back home .
This photo : this woman , man , I feel her .
I feel her .
She &apos;s anybody to me .
So here &apos;s what I want you to do .
Let &apos;s go back to my first example of the Chinese .
So I want you to go there .
And the soldiers are Chinese , and everybody else is Chinese .
As an American , how do you feel about this picture ?
What do you think about that scene ?
Okay , try this . Bring it back .
This is the scene here .
These gentlemen here , they &apos;re insurgents .
And maybe they succeeded . Maybe they succeeded .
Put yourself in the shoes of the Americans who caught them .
Can you feel the rage ?
Can you go there ?
It shouldn &apos;t be that difficult .
You just -- oh , man .
Now , put yourself in their shoes .
Are they brutal killers or patriotic defenders ?
Which one ?
I &apos;m going out to defend your freedom , your lives .
Can you imagine that ?
Can you imagine saying that ?
Can you go there ?
What do you think they &apos;re feeling ?
You see , that &apos;s empathy .
It &apos;s also understanding .
Why would you use this example of all examples ? &quot;
And I say , because ... because .
You &apos;re allowed to hate these people .
Whatever it is , you can go so far .
Step inside of the tiny , little world of somebody else .
And they build a big , complex world .
Everything has changed .
Everything in your life has changed .
And that &apos;s , of course , what this is about .
Attend to other lives , other visions .
Listen to other people , enlighten ourselves .
And now perhaps -- perhaps -- you do too .
Thank you .
Robin Ince : Science versus wonder ?
I do a radio show .
The radio show is called &quot; The Infinite Monkey Cage . &quot;
It &apos;s about science , it &apos;s about rationalism .
We know this because they did an experiment . &quot;
You bring in science , and it ruins the magic . &quot;
That &apos;s what I do .
That is gone .
This is a wonderful thing .
You &apos;ll been engulfed by a red giant . &quot;
That is a wonderful idea .
Now reincarnation , that &apos;s another thing gone -- the afterlife .
But it &apos;s not gone .
Science actually says we will live forever .
Well , there is one proviso .
That is a good thing .
We are all totally recyclable .
This is a wonderful thing .
And that is a wonderful thing there .
Love does not die because of that thing .
Pain doesn &apos;t go away either .
This is a terrible thing , even though I understand pain .
No , I just spit out a tooth .
I have a son . His name is Archie .
Now I know you don &apos;t think that .
Now in many ways , that &apos;s just a survival thing .
That is a wonderful thing .
I &apos;ve done some tests .
You house is in a terrible state .
Your partner is about to return .
You think , what should I do ?
Do nothing .
That &apos;s the strong anthropic principle of vacuuming .
For me , it &apos;s a very , very important thing .
I &apos;m sitting on a train .
I &apos;m sitting on a chair .
That , to me , is an incredible thing .
And do you know what , that might be enough .
I &apos;m glad the universe is pointless .
That &apos;s not the point . &quot;
I can make my own purpose .
You can make your own purpose .
Thank you very much . Goodbye .
Renny Gleeson : 404 , the story of a page not found
The 404 page is that .
It &apos;s that broken experience on the Web .
And it serves you the 404 page .
Because it &apos;s the feeling of a broken relationship .
Yes .
But these things are everywhere .
They &apos;re on sites big , they &apos;re on sites small .
This is a global experience .
A 404 page is not what you &apos;re looking for .
That &apos;s the 404 feeling .
I mean , I &apos;ve heard about that .
Joey !
Crowd : Whoa !
So this turned into a contest .
Dailypath that offers inspiration put inspiration on their 404 page .
Each one of them found this .
It turned into a 24-hour contest .
This is one that commiserates with you .
This is one that blames you .
This is one that I loved .
Thank you .
Amber Case : We are all cyborgs now
So what &apos;s a good definition for cyborg ?
People aren &apos;t supposed to be there .
So let &apos;s look at the concept of traditional anthropology .
They &apos;re clicking on things and staring at screens . &quot;
What does the inside of your computer actually look like ?
And suddenly we have to start to maintain our second self .
And I said , &quot; Great . &quot;
I thought I was very clever .
And I said , &quot; I want to do that . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Well , okay . &quot;
And I want to make a time machine . &quot;
So I started studying anthropology .
Every single browser tab gives you a different type of time .
So we have this thing called ambient intimacy .
And so there are some psychological effects that happen with this .
They &apos;re not just sitting there .
And so this is very important .
It actually looks very organic .
And it &apos;s not that machines are taking over .
So that &apos;s why I study cyborg anthropology .
Thank you .
Diana Nyad : Extreme swimming with the world &apos;s most dangerous jellyfish
How had I spent my valuable time ?
How could this have gone by like lightning ?
And then my mother died at 82 .
And I &apos;m not in the present whatsoever .
It was deep in my imagination .
No one &apos;s ever done it without a shark cage .
It &apos;s daunting .
And I started to train .
I hadn &apos;t swum for 31 years , not a stroke .
It &apos;s a smiling face .
And I put together an expedition .
The navigation is difficult .
It &apos;s tricky .
And there &apos;s dehydration .
And there &apos;s hypothermia .
And there are sharks .
And there are all kinds of problems .
Are your shoulders ready ?
And they were . They were prepared .
No stone left unturned .
Was the mind ready ?
You &apos;re really left alone with your own thoughts .
You save the French for last .
And it &apos;s odd , isn &apos;t it ?
And I couldn &apos;t wait to trip the mind fantastic .
Is there an edge ?
And I knew I could do it .
First of all , you &apos;re going to hit obstacles .
You &apos;re immersed in the liquid .
Your body doesn &apos;t like the saltwater .
And I was on fire -- excruciating , excruciating pain .
Help me ! Somebody help me ! &quot;
And the next thing is paralysis .
Then come convulsions .
He &apos;s stung .
My breath is down to three breaths a minute .
I need help , and I can &apos;t help Diana . &quot;
So that was at eight o &apos;clock at night .
It was like an ICU unit in the water .
They either die or they quickly get to a hospital .
And the next night at dusk , again , wham !
And I gave in to the staged swim .
And I got back in .
And I swam through that night and into the next day .
And at 41 hours , this body couldn &apos;t make it .
And the dream was crushed .
I &apos;ll just swim right through them .
Well there was no grin and bearing this .
And they have these long 30 to 40 to 50-ft. tentacles .
And they do this wrapping .
And they can send the poison into the system .
And a little kid from the back was like this .
&quot; Henry , what &apos;s your question ? &quot;
He said , &quot; That &apos;s what you need .
I finished the swim like this .
I was swimming with this thing on .
That &apos;s how scared of the jellyfish I was .
So now what do I do ?
Because we &apos;ve all had them , haven &apos;t we ?
We &apos;ve all had a heartache .
Yeah .
Thank you .
But that ocean &apos;s still there .
This hope is still alive .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
And so , what after that ?
Are you going to swim the Atlantic ?
No , that &apos;s the last swim .
It &apos;s the only swim I &apos;m interested in .
But I &apos;m ready .
I said , &quot; Nope . I didn &apos;t know . &quot;
And now I &apos;m going to live to 85 .
I have three more years than I thought .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
Live it large . Live it large .
Liza Donnelly : Drawing on humor for change
I was afraid of womanhood .
I &apos;ve learned to be flexible .
Let me explain .
There were plenty of role models all around us .
Now my mother was different .
And I just ate it up .
I was launched as a cartoonist .
We &apos;re told what shape we &apos;re supposed to be in .
We pass it down from generation to generation .
Humor relies on the traditions of a society .
It takes what we know , and it twists it .
Now what if you put together women and humor ?
I think you can get change .
I grew up not far from here in Washington D.C.
It didn &apos;t work .
My parents got divorced , and my sister was arrested .
But I found my place .
I can &apos;t help it . I live here .
Consequently , we have .
We have amazing antennae .
But I feel blessed to be able to work with them .
Thank you .
Jeff Skoll : My journey into movies that matter
You &apos;ve got a cruel sense of humor , TED .
Hollywood has its rivalries , and the Valley has its rivalries .
But I &apos;m actually here today to tell a story .
It &apos;s a world of peace and prosperity and sustainability .
And I think that &apos;s just a horrible thing .
So I set out in a hurry . I studied engineering .
And needless to say , I was right .
But for me , personally , it was a real change .
Bet on good people doing good things . &quot;
And that really resonated with me .
People today we call social entrepreneurs .
And I wondered who was doing these kinds of films today .
And then of course , there was the other adage .
We want them to actually get involved in the issues .
And much to my surprise , they were noticed .
We ended up with 11 Oscar nominations for these films .
I thought it was a 30 to 50 year problem .
We &apos;ve sent 50,000 DVDs to high school teachers in the U.S.
and it &apos;s really changed the debate on global warming .
It was also a pretty good year for this guy .
We now call Al the George Clooney of global warming .
And for Participant , this is just the start .
Everything we do looks at the major issues in the world .
I &apos;ll quickly talk about a few coming up .
It &apos;s been a real honor . Thank you .
Oh , thank you .
Sebastian Wernicke : 1000 TEDTalks , 6 words
There &apos;s currently over a thousand TEDTalks on the TED website .
I think we have a situation here .
How on earth are you going to spread a thousand ideas ?
And I did a little calculation of this .
Here &apos;s my approach to it all .
Isn &apos;t there something shorter ?
The only question is , how short can you get ?
Or &quot; Living in existential vacuum ; it sucks . &quot;
I actually like that one .
We could have been done by lunch here .
I mean ...
So I thought this was quite worthwhile .
So I would end up paying hundreds of dollars .
I would cut my costs by 90 percent .
He always proves us wrong .
They just had some general comment .
There were others , and I found this quite cheeky .
I don &apos;t know any TEDTalk that contains this .
Here are some of my favorites .
So here I was .
It &apos;s a huge list .
Again , there were some misunderstandings .
I mean that &apos;s the essence of it all .
So I had 50 overall summaries done .
Thank you very much .
Underwater astonishments
There &apos;s a flying turkey under a tree .
I &apos;m a geologist by training . But I love that .
And a lot of what goes on inside ...
there &apos;s a fish with glowing eyes , pulsating eyes .
Just absolutely amazing , every single dive .
Tough thing to do .
And the male ... We &apos;re going to see it again .
And there he is , his droopy little eyes up here .
But they can do pretty amazing things , too .
Disappears right into the background .
Positively amazing . Here &apos;s two males fighting .
That &apos;s an amazing thing .
Here &apos;s some algae in the foreground ...
That big brown makes his eyespot very big .
Watch the skin color ; watch the skin texture .
One , two , three .
Theo Jansen : My creations , a new form of life
Theo Jansen is working hard on this evolution .
Evolution has generated many species .
This is the Animaris Currens Ventosa .
I could show you this animal .
Thank you .
In fact , it &apos;s a new invention of the wheel .
It works the same as a wheel .
It &apos;s 3.2 tons .
And this is working on the stored winds in the bottles .
Can I have the feeler here ?
OK . Good .
And it must feel the water of the sea .
And this is the water feeler .
So imagine that the animal is walking towards the sea .
Here , we have the brain of the animal .
It &apos;s a binary step counter .
Thank you .
One of the biggest enemies are the storms .
And the nose is fixed , the whole animal is fixed .
I still have to help them a lot .
Thank you very much , ladies and gentlemen .
JD Schramm : Break the silence for suicide attempt survivors
From all outward appearances , John had everything going for him .
Remarkably -- no , miraculously -- he lived .
And that &apos;s actually where our story begins .
I know John &apos;s story very well because I &apos;m John .
As the Trevor Project says , it gets better .
It gets way better .
It &apos;s a conversation worth having and an idea worth spreading .
Thank you .
Pankaj Ghemawat : Actually , the world isn &apos;t flat
before we think about where we go from here .
So let &apos;s start off with plain old telephone service .
Pick a percentage in your own mind .
The answer turns out to be two percent .
Or let &apos;s turn to people moving across borders .
Again , please pick a percentage .
Turns out to be a little bit higher .
It &apos;s actually about three percent .
What percentage of that was accounted for by foreign direct investment ?
Not quite ten percent .
So clearly , apocalyptically-minded authors have overstated the case .
First of all , there is a suggestion of some error .
Okay .
A couple of different reasons come to mind .
So dearth of data in the debate is one reason .
A second reason has to do with peer pressure .
The perspective was , here is this poor professor .
The answer is probably somewhere between 10 to 15 percent .
Which brings me to my second point .
Think of France and the current debate about immigration .
Bono : The good news on poverty
That &apos;s an Englishman asking an Irishman to be succinct .
So , yeah .
And the Pharaoh replies , &quot; Oh , no .
You , your miserableness , have got to be kidding . &quot;
This time it &apos;s called the Facebook .
Crowds are gathered in Tahrir Square .
So exit the rock star .
Enter the evidence-based activist , the factivist .
Look at what &apos;s been achieved .
Look at the pictures these data sets print .
Wow . Wow .
Seven thousand kids a day . Here &apos;s two of them .
This fantastic news didn &apos;t happen by itself .
Give it up for that .
Halved . Halved .
There &apos;s still work to do .
But it &apos;s heart-stopping . It &apos;s mind-blowing stuff .
This is everything .
Can &apos;t be true , can it ?
We do love a good baseline .
That &apos;s amazing .
So the pride of lions is the proof of concept .
There are all kinds of benefits to this .
How about that ?
And 2028 , 2030 ? It &apos;s just around the corner .
I hope . I &apos;m hoping .
Makes us look really young .
So why aren &apos;t we jumping up and down about this ?
Look at this graph .
And the next one is really beautiful .
It &apos;s called momentum .
So inertia versus momentum .
But you can do something about that .
You can do something about that too .
But there &apos;s a vaccine for that too .
Daylight , you could call it , transparency .
And technology is really turbocharging this .
This is exciting stuff .
Once you have this knowledge , you can &apos;t un-know it .
It &apos;s transformational .
It &apos;s not going to kill you .
In fact , it could save countless lives .
Because as is obvious , factivists have feelings too .
I &apos;m thinking of Wael Ghonim , though .
Wael is right .
Thank you .
Thank you so much .
Jason Fried : Why work doesn &apos;t happen at work
But let &apos;s , sort of , start at the beginning .
And so these companies , they build offices .
It seems like it &apos;s perfectly reasonable to ask that .
Typically you get three different kinds of answers .
So here &apos;s some examples .
You almost never hear someone say the office .
What is that about ?
Why is that ?
Why is that happening ?
That &apos;s what happens at the office .
Then you have something else to do .
I mean , we &apos;ve all been through this .
I was at work .
I sat at my desk . I used my expensive computer .
I used the software they told me to use .
I went to these meetings I was asked to go to .
I did these conference calls . I did all this stuff .
But I didn &apos;t actually do anything .
I just did tasks .
I didn &apos;t actually get meaningful work done .
How about seven hours ?
Six ? Five ? Four ?
Two hours ? One , maybe ?
That &apos;s not really what I mean .
I don &apos;t think anyone would say yes .
And I &apos;m one of these managers .
I understand . I know how this goes .
We all have to improve on this sort of thing .
But oftentimes they &apos;ll cite distractions .
&quot; I can &apos;t let someone work at home .
Because those are voluntary distractions .
You decide when you want to be distracted by the TV .
You decide when you want to turn something on .
So let &apos;s go through a couple of those .
That &apos;s kind of ridiculous . It &apos;s a total decoy .
Those aren &apos;t the real problems in the office .
Those are the real problems in the modern office today .
That &apos;s kind of bad .
It doesn &apos;t work that way .
I don &apos;t care what you &apos;re doing .
What if they &apos;re thinking about something important ?
What if they &apos;re doing important work ?
Because meetings aren &apos;t work .
But meetings also procreate .
You don &apos;t schedule an eight-hour meeting with Outlook .
These things don &apos;t exist outside of the office .
So I have some suggestions to remedy the situation .
I have three suggestions I &apos;ll share with you guys .
I have about three minutes , so that &apos;ll fit perfectly .
We &apos;ve all heard of the casual Friday thing .
I don &apos;t know if people still do that .
But how about &quot; no-talk Thursdays ? &quot;
So just the afternoon , one Thursday .
Just silence , that &apos;s it .
It &apos;s better than a computer .
And maybe , hopefully you can do it more often .
You can quit I.M. ; you can &apos;t hide your manager .
Because work , like sleep , happens in phases .
Just don &apos;t have it .
And you &apos;ll find out that everything will be just fine .
And I think it &apos;ll all pay off in the end .
So thanks for listening .
Dianna Cohen : Tough truths about plastic pollution
And I thought , &quot; Great .
It &apos;s ephemeral just like us . &quot;
It &apos;s plastic pollution .
What is the reality of that ?
So this is a big issue for us .
Whenever possible , refuse single-use and disposable plastics .
Alternatives exist ; some of them are very old-school .
So whenever possible , to choose alternatives to single-use plastics .
Thank you .
Jay Walker : The world &apos;s English mania
Let &apos;s talk about manias .
Manias can be good .
Manias can be alarming .
Or manias can be deadly .
The world has a new mania .
A mania for learning English .
Listen as Chinese students practice their English by screaming it .
Teacher : ... change my life !
Students : I will change my life .
T : I don &apos;t want to let my parents down .
S : I don &apos;t want to let my parents down .
T : Most importantly ... S : Most importantly ...
T : I don &apos;t want to let myself down .
S : I don &apos;t want to let myself down .
Two billion of them .
Students : A t-shirt . A dress .
Why English ? In a single word : Opportunity .
Imagine a student taking a giant test for three full days .
Her score on this one test literally determines her future .
She studies 12 hours a day for three years to prepare .
25 percent of her grade is based on English .
Teacher : Perfect ! Students : Perfect !
T : Perfect ! S : Perfect !
T : I want to speak perfect English .
S : I want to speak perfect English .
T : I want to change my life !
S : I want to change my life !
JW : So is English mania good or bad ?
English is the world &apos;s second language .
Your native language is your life .
The world has other universal languages .
Mathematics is the language of science .
Music is the language of emotions .
And now English is becoming the language of problem-solving .
So English mania is a turning point .
Thank you very much .
Hello , Doha . Hello . Salaam alaikum .
Yeah ? And then a Swedish guy showed me my room .
I said , &quot; Where are the Qataris ? &quot;
&quot; They know . &quot;
And then we sat there for two minutes .
I &apos;m working already . &quot;
Any Lebanese by applause ? Lebanese .
Yeah . The Middle East is going crazy .
Who would have thought ? Oh my gosh .
No . There &apos;s serious issues in the region .
Every country is different and it &apos;s confusing , okay ?
I was in Lebanon , I got used to three .
I &apos;m going to be all right . &quot;
Qataris , you guys do the nose to nose .
I need to rest . &quot;
There &apos;s so much , we laugh , right ?
Maybe like an evil -- like , &quot; Wuhahaha , wuhahaha .
We like to laugh . We like to celebrate life .
Never &quot; Hi , Jack . &quot;
&quot; &#91; Imitating Arabic &#93; -- rainbow ! &quot;
&quot; &#91; Imitating Arabic &#93; -- Tutti Frutti ! &quot;
Thank you very much . Have a good night .
Thank you , TED .
Handspring Puppet Co . : The genius puppetry behind War Horse
AK : The ancestor of the horse .
Okay , we &apos;ll do something with it .
Hahahaha .
So it needed a very articulate front paw .
But , like all puppets , it has other attributes .
AK : Haa haa haaa .
BJ : Breath is really important for us .
BJ : From an actor .
Puppets always have to try to be alive .
And in a way that &apos;s a metaphor for life .
BJ : Okay so .
BJ : His mother was a puppeteer .
I really thought they were so beneath me .
BJ : And here again , you see the same structure .
And he &apos;s controlling the ear movement .
AK : It seemed a lovely idea .
But they agreed to go along with it for a while .
So we began with a test .
So we made a model .
BJ : And the two manipulators are inside .
And we had a crate built for it .
It had to be shipped to London .
BJ : About 40 people .
AK : We were terrified .
It had by no means got the green light yet .
And so the show was given the green light .
Here is the plan .
The horses are completely handmade .
There is very little 20th century technology in them .
And now we would like to introduce you to Joey .
Joey boy , you there ?
Joey .
Joey .
Joey , come here .
No , no , I haven &apos;t got it .
He &apos;s got it ; it &apos;s in his pocket .
BJ : Joey .
AK : Joey , Joey , Joey , Joey .
Come here . Stand here where people can see you .
Move around . Come on .
Here , Craig is working the head .
But he also controls the head directly by using his hand .
Horses &apos; hearing is very important .
It &apos;s almost more important than their eyesight .
He &apos;s working the leg .
Horses are so unpredictable .
The hind legs have got the same action .
AK : You want to say something about the breathing ?
BJ : We had a big challenge with breathing .
AK : Other emotional stuff .
You see the skeletal structure of it .
Again , that was a practical consideration .
It &apos;s three heads making one character .
And plant .
Thank you .
AK : Mikey Brett from Leicestershire .
Thank you . Thank you .
Amy Webb : How I hacked online dating
I don &apos;t understand why this keeps happening .
So I asked everybody in my life what they thought .
You &apos;ve got to date around .
I am constantly swimming in numbers and formulas and charts .
So that wasn &apos;t going to work .
So again , I started doing some math .
Population of Philadelphia : It has 1.5 million people .
That &apos;s only 2.3 percent of the population .
Are the families going to get along ?
What &apos;s the rabbi going to say ?
Are they going to start having children right away ?
So I decided to sign on .
Now , there was one small catch .
But that actually wasn &apos;t the biggest problem .
So I just copied and pasted from my résumé .
I talked a lot about JavaScript .
There was this guy Steve , the I.T. guy .
And listen , I &apos;m a modern woman .
I am totally down with splitting the bill .
But then Steve the I.T. guy didn &apos;t come back .
And that was my entire month &apos;s rent .
And they say to me , &quot; Stop complaining . &quot;
&quot; You &apos;re just being too picky . &quot;
There were just bad for me .
Do you like horror films or romance films ?
I &apos;m not looking for a pen pal .
I &apos;m looking for a husband . Right ?
So there &apos;s a certain amount of superficiality in that data .
So I said fine , I &apos;ve got a new plan .
These things were also important to me but not necessarily deal-breakers .
Well , as it turns out , this worked pretty well .
So I go back online now .
And I thought , I &apos;ve done it !
I &apos;ve cracked the code .
Who are all of the other women on these dating sites ?
I found SmileyGirl1978 .
She listed her job as teacher .
She said she is &quot; silly , nice and friendly . &quot;
She likes to make people laugh &quot; alot . &quot;
So I created 10 fake male profiles .
I didn &apos;t carry on crazy Catfish-style relationships with anybody .
I really was just scraping their data .
But I didn &apos;t want everybody &apos;s data .
So I didn &apos;t reach out to any woman first .
And as it turns out , content matters a lot .
Also , optimistic language matters a lot .
And finally , there were the photos .
All of the women who were popular showed some skin .
I was the most popular person online .
How soon are you going out ? &quot;
He talked in detail about travel .
He made a lot of really interesting cultural references .
It was enough for a date .
In fact , it &apos;s something that you write yourself .
Now , your matzoh balls .
They should be fluffy , not hard . &quot;
And I &apos;ll take her advice on that .
Richard Seymour : How beauty feels
But I felt something .
And it was a physiological response .
Now you probably know the answer to this already .
Remember that ?
I remember it clearly .
I remember sitting there thinking , this is fantastic .
I thought , well what the hell &apos;s that about ?
So I started to ask myself questions about it .
I thought , well that &apos;s not good enough .
And so I did some experiments .
Do you know what it is ? Anyone ?
And this isn &apos;t a think , it &apos;s a feel .
And would you do me a favor ?
I felt a sense of relaxation tempered with anticipation .
I get a sense of anticipation &quot; ?
Now I &apos;m not a neuroscientist .
But it might be .
Everybody likes it , but some like it more than others .
They arrive first .
So how do we make that actually work ?
This is one of the most beautiful things I know .
It &apos;s a plastic bag .
Look at that . What are you feeling about it ?
Is it beautiful ? Is it exciting ?
I &apos;m watching your faces very carefully .
Maybe there &apos;s an innocence to it .
Look at that picture .
Look at the innocence . Look at the beauty in it .
Is it beautiful now ?
Stop . Stop . How do you feel ?
Where are you feeling this ?
I &apos;m feeling it here . I feel it here .
The lady over there is actually crying , by the way .
But what are you doing ?
I watch what people do .
I watch faces .
I watch reactions .
Because I have to know how people react to things .
It &apos;s not a &quot; this is wonderful ! &quot;
That &apos;s not the expression of joy .
There &apos;s something else in that .
There &apos;s something weird happening .
Poignancy is a word I love as a designer .
It isn &apos;t just about nice .
And that &apos;s packed in there as well .
So a lot of it tends to be extrinsic .
It &apos;s mediated by information before the comprehension .
Well it obviously isn &apos;t .
And they found that it was almost exact coincidence .
So it wasn &apos;t about symmetry .
But they &apos;re both different .
I &apos;m not getting it off the eyebrow .
And this is the F1 MV Agusta .
Ahhhh .
It &apos;s masses and masses of layers .
This is just the bit that protrudes into our physical dimension .
It &apos;s something much bigger .
Layer after layer of legend , sport , details that resonate .
So that &apos;s getting me excited .
And I feel that here .
Titanium lacquer on this .
I can &apos;t tell you how wonderful this is .
I &apos;m really getting into this now .
So it disappears .
Why would you do that ?
So it &apos;s more expensive , but it &apos;s wonderful .
Massimo Tamburini .
We have to deal with it .
And so look at her .
I &apos;ve had to make a bit of a compromise there .
No one &apos;s noticed , have they yet ?
Did you see what I did ?
I moved three things by a millimeter .
Pretty ? Yes .
Beautiful ? Maybe lesser .
So that &apos;s okay , isn &apos;t it ?
Another millimeter ?
No one &apos;s going to notice those split lines and changes .
And only a few people can do it .
And a focus group cannot do it .
And a team rarely can do it .
So all hail to that .
It &apos;s a fantastic example , a simple object .
So we &apos;re going to have a little experiment .
Are you ready ? Okay .
It &apos;s not .
Did you think it was modern ? Yes you did .
That blip , that information , shot into you before that .
So is that wrong ?
But you &apos;re a slave of that first flash .
It wins or loses at that point .
And finally , the layer that I love , of knowledge .
Yeah ?
It &apos;s fantastic , isn &apos;t it ?
Look at that . Do you want to see it again ?
That &apos;s how underpaid younger-aged people have to fold your T-shirt .
You didn &apos;t maybe know it .
But how do you feel about it ?
Form follows function ?
Only sometimes . Only sometimes .
Form is function . Form is function .
Thank you very much .
Tom Thum : The orchestra in my mouth
Wassup .
Thank you very much , TEDx .
Look at this , Mom ! I made it !
We start our journey in the central deserts .
India .
China .
Germany .
Party , party , yeah .
TEDx .
I got way too much time on my hands .
All right boys , take it away .
Thank you . Thank you very much .
Lesley Hazleton : On reading the Koran
Now I did have an advantage .
So I read slowly .
But all is not lost in translation .
Or take the infamous verse about killing the unbelievers .
Only God knows the true meaning .
Old-fashioned Orientalism comes into play here .
Not a swelling breast nor a high bosom in sight .
And that number 72 never appears .
There are no 72 virgins in the Koran .
Paradise is quite the opposite .
It &apos;s not virginity ; it &apos;s fecundity .
It &apos;s plenty .
It &apos;s gardens watered by running streams .
Thank you .
Eddi Reader : &quot; What You &apos;ve Got &quot;
Karen Tse : How to stop torture
He was not a political prisoner .
He was a 12-year-old boy who had stolen a bicycle .
And the third is commitment .
Could we do something for these 93 countries ?
But Cambodia is not alone .
I used to think , well is it Cambodia ?
Or is it other countries ?
But it is in so many countries .
It wasn &apos;t a baby , she was three .
A judge would let her out . &quot;
What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
I said , &quot; I &apos;m gonna copy this . &quot;
Prosecutors were perfectly trained .
Because it sounds big .
And there are many reasons why I believe it &apos;s possible .
We need to systematically implement early access to counsel .
Never going to happen . &quot;
But I &apos;m one . I can do something .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Kim Gorgens : Protecting the brain against concussion
Awwww .
I &apos;ll just say , July .
Zzzzzzip for safety .
Water wings -- an inch of water .
So you can get kind of a feel for this .
So my baby , Vander , is eight years old now .
He &apos;s interested in playing football .
He wants to learn how to ride a unicycle .
So why would I worry ?
It &apos;s what I study . It &apos;s what I treat .
And I know that kids get concussed every year .
Let &apos;s take a look .
So a car accident .
Forty miles an hour into a fixed barrier -- 35 Gs .
In case you missed it , we &apos;ll look again .
So look to the right-hand side of the screen .
What would you say ?
How many Gs ?
Close .
Seventy-two .
Would it be crazy to know , 103 Gs .
The average concussive impact is 95 Gs .
Because I know our brains are resilient .
They &apos;re designed to recover from an injury .
But kids are more vulnerable to brain injury .
So how do we guarantee the safety of our kids ?
How can we 100 percent guarantee the safety of our kids ?
Let me tell you what I &apos;ve come up with .
If only .
She &apos;s totally not kidding . &quot;
So in all seriousness , should my kid play football ?
Should your kid play football ? I don &apos;t know .
But I do know there are three things you can do .
The first : study up .
There are some great resources out there .
The CDC has a program , Heads Up .
It &apos;s at CDC.gov.
Heads Up is specific to concussion in kids .
The second is a resource I &apos;m personally really proud of .
It &apos;s a great place to start if you have questions .
The second thing is : speak up .
Speak up also with coaching staff .
Ask about what kind of protective equipment is available .
What &apos;s the budget for protective equipment ?
How old it is ?
Wear a helmet .
So , should Vander play football ?
Thank you .
Ellen &apos; t Hoen : Pool medical patents , save lives
They were not the only ones .
So there was a bit of a conflict there .
So what has this got to do with this ?
He was told that a cure did not exist .
AIDS had become a chronic disease .
In 2002 , they were facing a different battle .
Luckily , those patents did not exist everywhere .
Today , eight million people have access to antiretroviral drugs .
Thirty-four million are infected with HIV .
People who have access to these drugs stop dying .
And there &apos;s something else .
They also stop passing on the virus .
This is fairly recent science that has shown that .
So what &apos;s the problem ?
Well , things have changed .
First of all , the rules have changed .
So what India did is no longer possible .
Second , the practice of patent-holding companies have changed .
It isn &apos;t only the number of drugs that are patented .
There &apos;s something else that can really scare generic manufacturers away .
This shows you a patent landscape .
This is the landscape of one medicine .
Again , deliberate action is needed .
And we did .
In 2010 , UNITAID established the Medicines Patent Pool for HIV .
That can be generic manufacturers .
It can also be not-for-profit drug development agencies , for example .
There is one key difference with the airplane patent pool .
The Medicines Patent Pool is a voluntary mechanism .
They were forced to do so .
That is something that the Medicines Patent Pool cannot do .
Today , Nelson Otwoma is healthy .
He has access to antiretroviral drugs .
His son will soon be 14 years old .
And this is no longer fantasy .
Already , I &apos;ll give you an example .
This has never been done before .
This has never been seen before .
Thank you .
David Deutsch : Chemical scum that dream of distant quasars
Nowadays this idea has a dramatic name : Spaceship Earth .
But that doesn &apos;t prevent them from both being completely false .
And so what does that look like ? Typical .
What does a typical place in the universe look like ?
That &apos;s how big and how dark the universe is .
And that is how un-typical this place is .
So , the laws of physics have this special property .
Now , our environment is inundated with evidence .
Now actually , that &apos;s just another parochial misconception .
So we &apos;re not in a uniquely hospitable place .
And the controversy is global warming .
At the moment , these things are fringe research .
So take two stone tablets , and carve on them .
Thank you .
Cynthia Schneider : The surprising spread of Idol TV
Well , you probably recognize the first person .
It all begins with enjoyment .
We are late to watch &quot; Afghan Star . &quot;
We are running late .
We must go to watch &quot; Afghan Star . &quot;
Cynthia Schneider : These programs are reaching incredibly deeply into society .
People watch it all over the country also in public places .
Contestants also put themselves forward .
This has opened up the door , particularly for women .
And she &apos;s out there .
But actually , just the opposite is happening .
They don &apos;t sing pop songs , they sing Afghan music .
No small thing .
Thank you .
Bastian Schaefer : A 3D-printed jumbo jet ?
What do we know about the future ?
Difficult question , simple answer : nothing .
We cannot predict the future .
What are the main customers of the future ?
These are the future anthropometrics .
These people have different needs .
We want to be treated as individuals .
So we combined these needs with technology &apos;s themes .
How can we bring more natural light into the airplane ?
So this airplane has no windows anymore , for example .
This will be very different in the future .
It will communicate directly with the passenger in its environment .
So let &apos;s compare the old world with the new world .
So this is a bracket of an A380 crew rest compartment .
This here is an equal bracket for the same purpose .
It follows the design of bone .
The design process is completely different .
Push this idea a little bit forward .
So how does nature build its components and structures ?
And nature builds large skeletons out of it .
And the same approach can be applied to technology as well .
How this looks in particular , you can show it here .
And you &apos;ve got trillions of them .
So how might the airplane of the future look ?
See you in the future . Thank you .
Adam Garone : Healthier men , one moustache at a time
I think the beautiful Malin &#91; Akerman &#93; put it perfectly .
How did Movember start ?
Why hasn &apos;t that made a comeback ?
So my boss wouldn &apos;t let me go and see clients .
Parents would shuffle kids away from us .
We can &apos;t have anything to do with you . &quot;
So my lesson that year was persistence .
Essentially , I &apos;m a mustache farmer .
And my season is November .
Then in early 2007 , a really interesting thing happened .
Bring this campaign to these countries .
So we thought , why not ? Let &apos;s do it .
I &apos;ve heard this before . I know how it goes .
It wasn &apos;t as successful as we thought it would be .
And for us , we have redefined charity .
Our ribbon is a hairy ribbon .
We hand across our brand and our campaign to those people .
And I said , &quot; Okay , that &apos;s interesting . &quot;
Your mom would be so proud . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Thank you for doing Movember . &quot;
And I said , &quot; What &apos;s your Movember story ? &quot;
So now , that guy is getting screened for prostate cancer .
We fund prostate cancer foundations now in 13 countries .
And that &apos;s how we &apos;re redefining the research world .
My name is Adam Garone , and that &apos;s my story .
Thank you .
Simon Sinek : How great leaders inspire action
For example : Why is Apple so innovative ?
And yet , they &apos;re just a computer company .
They &apos;re just like everyone else .
Then why is it that they seem to have something different ?
Why him ?
There &apos;s something else at play here .
About three and a half years ago I made a discovery .
As it turns out , there &apos;s a pattern .
And it &apos;s the complete opposite to everyone else .
I call it the golden circle .
Why ? How ? What ?
Let me define the terms really quickly .
That &apos;s a result . It &apos;s always a result .
What &apos;s your cause ? What &apos;s your belief ?
Why does your organization exist ?
Why do you get out of bed in the morning ?
And why should anyone care ?
Let me give you an example .
They &apos;re beautifully designed , simple to use and user friendly .
Want to buy one ? &quot; &quot; Meh . &quot;
And that &apos;s how most of us communicate .
But it &apos;s uninspiring .
Here &apos;s how Apple actually communicates .
We believe in thinking differently .
We just happen to make great computers .
Want to buy one ? &quot;
All I did was reverse the order of the information .
In fact , they tried .
They &apos;re eminently qualified to make flat screen TVs .
They &apos;ve been making flat screen monitors for years .
Nobody bought one .
Why would you buy an MP3 player from a computer company ?
But we do it every day .
It &apos;s all grounded in the tenets of biology .
Not psychology , biology .
It just doesn &apos;t drive behavior .
This is where gut decisions come from .
Most people don &apos;t know about Samuel Pierpont Langley .
Everybody was trying it .
Money was no problem .
Then how come we &apos;ve never heard of Samuel Pierpont Langley ?
Samuel Pierpont Langley was different .
He was in pursuit of the result .
He was in pursuit of the riches .
And lo and behold , look what happened .
The others just worked for the paycheck .
We found out about it a few days later .
Well , you can trip over 10 percent of the customers .
That &apos;s how we describe them , right ?
It &apos;s because they wanted to be first .
First , the famous failure .
It &apos;s a commercial example .
Look at TiVo .
They were extremely well-funded .
Market conditions were fantastic .
I mean , we use TiVo as verb .
But TiVo &apos;s a commercial failure .
They &apos;ve never made money .
We don &apos;t need it . We don &apos;t like it .
You &apos;re scaring us . &quot;
How do you do that ?
In fact , some of his ideas were bad .
But he had a gift .
He went around and told people what he believed .
How many of them showed up for him ?
Zero .
They showed up for themselves .
We followed , not for him , but for ourselves .
Listen to politicians now , with their comprehensive 12-point plans .
They &apos;re not inspiring anybody .
Because there are leaders and there are those who lead .
Thank you very much .
Inge Missmahl : Bringing peace to the minds of Afghanistan
Jung in Afghanistan -- you get the picture .
War and malnutrition kills people together with hope .
Yet , there is hope .
So , doctors prescribe medication .
Military collect weapons , and depression stays intact .
Why ?
No one can survive alone .
And very often violence is a way to cope with it .
And partly this is already happening .
But let me repeat the words of the woman .
So the key here is empathy .
Somebody has to feel how you felt .
And somebody has to see you and listen to you .
And I started thinking about a counseling program .
But , of course , I needed help and funds .
At that time , it was the head of Caritas Germany .
Eleven thousand people came -- more than that .
And 70 percent regained their lives .
And they are working with me up to today .
We developed a culturally-sensitive psycho-social counseling approach .
This means , certainly , to retrain all health staff .
We wanted to know if what is being done is effective .
And all the symptoms stayed the same or even got worse .
And I would like to share one short vignette .
So I believe this kept me running .
I thank you for your attention .
Brenda Romero : Gaming for understanding
All these things happen to me .
This is one my partner and I worked on .
So this one here , this is the 1980 Olympics .
And so this was just an amazing experience .
So games , it means something more to us .
It absolutely means something more .
So now , just , this is an abrupt transition here .
And this is one of my favorite shots here .
And this is actually from his Degradation series .
Just imagine if that &apos;s a black guy .
Right ? Like , seriously , nobody would do this .
But every other medium does it .
Pause for about 10 seconds .
&quot; Can I play a game , Mommy ? &quot;
And so I happened to have all of these little pieces .
So she &apos;s painting her little families .
This was the boat . It was made quickly obviously .
Nobody wants to go on the Middle Passage . &quot;
&quot; So Daddy could be gone . &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot;
She got it because she spent time with these people .
And so it was just an incredibly powerful experience .
But when this happened , I saw the whole planet .
My history is Irish .
I made another game called Train .
And I also made a game about the Trail of Tears .
This is a game with 50,000 individual pieces .
It &apos;s the same thing .
I &apos;m hoping that I &apos;ll teach culture through these games .
And originally it was a math problem more or less .
Like , here &apos;s the economics of illegal immigration .
I &apos;ll look away from the picture .
Ann Cooper : What &apos;s wrong with school lunches
These are some of my kids with a salad bar .
Everyone says it couldn &apos;t be done .
How do we really change children &apos;s relationship to food ?
That &apos;s my premise .
We &apos;re seeing sick kids get sicker and sicker .
The way we got here is because of big agribusiness .
And then we talk about organic food .
We can &apos;t keep doing that .
You know , it doesn &apos;t work .
And the results of that are kids getting sick .
One of my big soapboxes right now is antibiotics .
Seventy percent -- it &apos;s unbelievable .
And the result of it is , we have diseases .
And that is what the USDA allows in our food supply .
And that has to change , you know .
We cannot believe that they have our best interests at heart .
The antithesis of this whole thing is sustainable food .
That &apos;s what I really try and get people to understand .
It really is just a new idea .
It &apos;s no wonder , you know , we have criminals .
And what &apos;s happening is , we &apos;re getting sick .
We &apos;re getting sick and our kids are getting sick .
It is about what we feed them .
What goes in is what we are .
We really are what we eat .
What &apos;s going to happen to our whole medical system ?
What &apos;s going to happen ?
And it &apos;s because of what we feed them .
You know , we are responsible for what kids eat .
But oops , maybe they &apos;re responsible for what kids eat .
20 billion dollars a year . 10,000 ads most kids see .
And why can they serve that much ?
Why can we have 29-cent Big Gulps and 99-cent double burgers ?
Which is why I say it &apos;s a social justice issue .
Well , this is the food I found 24 months ago .
This is not even food .
Everything came in plastic , in cardboard .
The only kitchen tools my staff had was a box cutter .
The USDA allows this .
The USDA allows all of this stuff .
But this is what most schools serve .
There &apos;s not a strawberry tree or a carrot bush .
Now , in Berkeley , we &apos;ve gone totally fresh .
We &apos;re cooking from scratch every day .
Those are my hands . I get up at 4 a.m.
They &apos;re not going to be smart .
You know what ? They &apos;re just going to be sick .
And these calendars really started to lay out my program .
So this is a typical menu .
This is what we &apos;re serving this week at the schools .
And you see these recipes on the side ?
They do tastings of these ingredients in the gardening classes .
The really tiny hamburger , the really big vegetables .
We have to start changing this .
What are kids learning ? Where is the family time ?
Where is socialization ? Where is discussion ?
Where is learning to talk ?
You know , we have to change it .
EATWISE -- Enlightened and Aware Teens Who Inspire Smart Eating .
We have recycling in all of our schools .
One of the things I do a lot is public-private partnerships .
Schools are underfunded .
That comes down to under five dollars an hour .
We really need to change it .
It &apos;s going to take more money .
It &apos;s sort of this &quot; duh &quot; thing .
We need to -- we need to educate .
We need to educate the kids .
We need to educate the staff .
I had 90 employees .
Two were supposed to be cooks -- none could .
But we really have to educate .
That is not lunchtime .
That number probably needs to double .
We spend 100 billion dollars a year on diet aids .
200 billion .
You know what ? We should be ashamed .
We , as a country , should be ashamed at that .
The richest country .
We can all make a difference .
Sit down and care .
Thank you .
Fabian Oefner : Psychedelic science
And yet , they do it in a very different way .
Let me demonstrate this based on three projects .
The first one has to do with making sound visible .
So I came up with the following setup .
Let me show you what this looks like .
Thank you very much .
I agree , it looks pretty amazing .
But I have to tell you a funny story .
Has anyone of you heard of ferrofluid ?
Ah , some of you have . Excellent .
Should I skip that part ?
Ferrofluid has a very strange behavior .
It &apos;s a liquid that is completely black .
It &apos;s got an oily consistency .
Those are just standard watercolors that you would paint with .
That &apos;s because the ferrofluid itself is hydrophobic .
That means it doesn &apos;t mix with the water .
So that was the second project .
Now you might ask yourself , how did he do that ?
And at the same time , alcohol is highly flammable .
Let me demonstrate this over here .
And what I have here is an empty glass vessel .
It &apos;s got nothing in it .
Add some more .
And now , let &apos;s set that on fire .
So that &apos;s all that happens .
It goes really fast , and it &apos;s not that impressive .
So that &apos;s how those images were made .
Thank you .
What &apos;s the idea behind it ?
Is it just a waste of whiskey ?
Is it just some strange materials ?
Thank you very much .
James Flynn : Why our IQ levels are higher than our grandparents&apos;
And our minds have altered , too .
Now this has raised all sorts of questions .
Were our immediate ancestors on the verge of mental retardation ?
Because 70 is normally the score for mental retardation .
Or are we on the verge of all being gifted ?
Because 130 is the cutting line for giftedness .
And initially , that archaeologist would be baffled .
How could these performances have escalated to this enormous degree ?
Well we now know , of course , the answer .
And the fellow said , &quot; Absolutely nothing .
A crow can peck at a fish .
A fish can &apos;t do anything to a crow . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Of course not .
One &apos;s a fish .
The other is a bird . &quot;
Hamburg is a city in Germany .
Are there camels in Hamburg ? &quot;
A third interview was conducted with someone about the North Pole .
Wherever there is always snow , the bears are white .
What color are the bears at the North Pole ? &quot;
They weren &apos;t willing to engage in this .
None of these problems are real .
How can we address them ? &quot;
And let me give you a few illustrations .
You can &apos;t do science without proposing hypotheses .
You can &apos;t do science without making it logically consistent .
And even down in grade school , things have changed .
They put it in Albany rather than New York .
They put it in Harrisburg rather than Philadelphia .
And so forth .
So the tenor of education has changed .
What about employment ?
Only three percent were lawyers or doctors or teachers .
A whole range of professions now make cognitive demands .
The professions have been upgraded .
They went far beyond that 1900 banker .
They had to look at computer projections for the housing market .
Or take a farmer today .
But I &apos;ve talked about education and employment .
I &apos;m primarily a moral philosopher .
But he did have a sense that black people were inferior .
they said that is the dumbest thing you &apos;ve ever said .
How would you feel about that ?
They &apos;re just inherited mores .
Would you deserve to be killed ?
That &apos;s not one of the principles I &apos;ve got .
Well you , today , universalize your principles .
You state them as abstractions and you use logic on them .
It must be that blacks are somehow tainted .
Now how did all of this arise out of I.Q. tests ?
That &apos;s what initially got me going on cognitive history .
And in 1900 , people could do simple analogies .
What are dogs like ?
They would say wolves .
They could say a semicircle .
Now , I should say one thing that &apos;s very disheartening .
We haven &apos;t made progress on all fronts .
They live in the bubble of the present .
But I don &apos;t want to end on a pessimistic note .
As if they were a reptile .
Dan Gilbert : Why we make bad decisions
This is what statisticians technically call a damn fine bet .
Now , let me talk about the first one first .
The reason is , this isn &apos;t how people do odds .
So , for example , here &apos;s a word puzzle .
It &apos;s because the mind recalls words by their first letter .
Compare these to the actual numbers .
It &apos;s not interesting because it &apos;s so common .
Drownings and asthma deaths don &apos;t get much coverage .
Why in the world would anybody ever play the lottery ?
There &apos;s 10 tickets in this lottery .
Nine of them have been sold to these individuals .
Well , Bernoulli tells us it is .
Leroy has nine tickets ; there &apos;s one left .
It &apos;s easy to see Leroy getting the check , right ?
I want to talk now about errors in value .
And this is a systematic error people make .
Imagine that you &apos;re going to the theater .
You &apos;re on your way to the theater .
You also have a 20-dollar bill .
Would you spend your remaining money on replacing it ?
Most people answer , no .
Now , let &apos;s just change one thing in this scenario .
When you arrive you discover you &apos;ve lost one of them .
Would you spend your remaining 20 dollars on a ticket ?
Along the way , you lost something .
In both cases , it was a piece of paper .
What the hell difference should it make ?
Suddenly , we &apos;re almost longing for him to return .
The comparison changes how we evaluate him .
So , they will opt for the item in the middle .
Let me just give you an example .
Of course , what happens when they eat the potato chips ?
Most people say they would .
This kind of thinking drives economists crazy , and it should .
It doesn &apos;t know what you saved it on .
You &apos;ve all had this experience .
This is what we call a one-item IQ test , OK ?
Well , by and large people are enormously impatient .
What do we find now ?
What makes this dynamic inconsistency happen ?
Comparison . Troubling comparison . Let me show you .
These guys can tell us .
However , the difference between them seems to be getting smaller .
Here are the results of what I just showed you .
And I want you to see that two things are true .
Watch what happens when we drop some out .
Suddenly we have the dynamic inconsistency that puzzled us .
I &apos;ll take the 50 dollars now .
Thank you .
That was remarkable .
Talk more about it .
It &apos;s out-sized . I mean , look .
If Australia disappears tomorrow , terror is probably the right response .
Is terror the right response ?
What is it ?
That &apos;s not my point at all .
I think in the case of terrorism , it isn &apos;t .
There are no guns going off .
That &apos;s a tough one .
There &apos;s no question .
People died ; so be it .
And so we evolved these responses .
Is that what happened ?
That &apos;s what you think it is . All right ?
It &apos;s not because she is stupid or he is stupid .
Last question .
For you or for them ?
AdG : In persuading them .
Ah , for you in persuading them .
But these are tricks around the margins .
Richard Wilkinson : How economic inequality harms societies
But first , see what a miserable lot we are .
I want to start though with a paradox .
And it makes no difference to their life expectancy at all .
There &apos;s no suggestion of a relationship there .
This , again , is life expectancy .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to show you .
I &apos;m not using any hypothetical data .
We put them all in one index .
They &apos;re all weighted equally .
It &apos;s an extraordinarily close correlation .
It has 40 different components put together by other people .
Everything goes into it .
Here it is in relation to that same measure of inequality .
Kids do worse in the more unequal societies .
Highly significant relationship .
Here , for instance , is trust .
It comes from the World Values Survey .
I may say , we did all this work twice .
Very similar scatter over a similar range of levels of trust .
Same thing is going on .
We &apos;re not just talking about a fluke .
This is mental illness .
And again , closely related to inequality .
This is violence .
But look at the scale of the differences .
It goes from 15 homicides per million up to 150 .
This is the proportion of the population in prison .
But it goes from about 40 to 400 people in prison .
That relationship is not mainly driven by more crime .
In some places , that &apos;s part of it .
